                Kathleen ‘Kappy’ Kirk Wright was born in Columbus OH in 1918. Her family moved to Washington DC in
                1931 where she met <a href="./index.html#dad" onClick='closeDialog(momModal)'>Jack Wright</a>. They were
                married in 1942. A loving wife and superb mother, she had ten <a href="./index.html#siblings"

                with a love and devotion that is hard to describe. Along with her husband, she earned her private
                pilot’s license in 1967 and enjoyed <a href="documents/FlightLogsCombined.pdf">flying with him</a> for
                several years. But her greatest love was her very large extended family, including her brother, five
                sisters and their thirty nieces and nephews, nine children and their partners, and the
                constantly-growing
                list of <a href="children.html">grandchildren</a>. After a long bout with cancer, she passed away
                peacefully at home in 1994, leaving many <a href="documents/momMemories.pdf">memories</a> behind.

                For almost 15 years, as his children grew and, one-by-one, began to leave home, Jack wrote annual
                letters addressed to them collectively as a way of staying in touch with them. Addressed variously to
                ‘All of our children,’ ‘Wright Clan,’ and ‘Sons and Daughters,’ he eventually settled on ‘Dear All.’
                These letters were mailed as Easter approached and continued his commitment to preaching his faith.

                    that the youngs perhaps need a citation to recognize the trade-name Xerox as such machines are now
                    known simply as ‘copiers.’)

                    single page (although this letter also includes several lengthy attachments related to the return

                Anne Kathryn Wright (named for her paternal and maternal grandmothers respectively) was
                born in Bremerton WA and grew up in Silver Spring. She lived briefly in Massachusetts before
                moving to San Diego in 1975 with her first husband <a href="404.html">Doug Deneen</a>
                and baby daughter <a href="./children.html#jesseRennyByfield">Jesse</a>.
                Anne married <a href="partners.html#kennethMayer">Ken Mayer</a> in 1987, the same year she passed the
                California bar exam. After
                Ken died in 2014, Anne lived briefly in Burien WA, before spending several years in the heart
                of Des Moines’ rich pageant. In 2021, she followed her now-grown daughter Jesse and son-in-law
                <a href="partners.html#simonRennyByfield">Simon</a> to Cabot Cove in the hills near Colorado Springs CO.
              </p>
              <p class="long-copy">
                Anne left us peacefully on the evening of June 12, 2023 after an all-too-brief battle with
                cancer. As one of us siblings wrote … and then there were seven.
              </p>
              <p class="long-copy">
                First, and most appropriately, Anne wrote her own obituary. Pieced together from various
                notes and writings, and included at the beginning of this <a href="documents/anneObit.pdf">testament
              </a>, it tells the story of
                her life, perfectly showcases her wit, sarcasm, and irreverence, and at the same time
                continuously catches the reader off guard with surprisingly deep insights, loving thoughts, and
                remembrances that pop up unexpectedly in the midst of her musings. The testament also
                includes Anne’s personal recollection of each of us siblings, written in her own inimitable style
                as she spent time remembering and reviewing her life and things important to her. These
                vignettes serve as individual and intimate good-byes to each of us and demonstrate her
                desire to make sure that each of us knew we were individually important to her. This
                testimony provides a full picture of the Anne we all knew and loved.
              </p>
              <p class="long-copy">
                Then there is music, which was always a part of Anne’s life. While in San Diego, she and Ken
                amassed a large collection of CDs reflecting her many-sided musical taste. It’s not surprising,
                then, that she used music to help her understand and come to terms with her illness.
                Herewith a <a href="documents/annePlaylist.pdf">playlist</a> she created during her final weeks and
                months. Like her
                testament above (but not for casual listening) its songs display the breadth and depth of her
                personality.
              </p>
              <p class="long-copy">
                Finally, and in addition to Music, Anne loved words. She read extensively and, whenever she
                encountered a particularly memorable, profound, or pithy poem, quote, or statement, she
                wrote it down. She would recall these quotes as needed to punctuate her writings and
                conversations. We have collected many of these notes, in no particularly meaningful
                sequence, in this list of <a href="documents/anneQuotes.pdf">quotes and aphorisms</a> for your reading
                pleasure.

              <p class="long-copy">Charlie was born in Washington DC in 1948 and grew up in Silver Spring MD.
                As a college boy, rather than partying, Charlie spent his weekends caving in West Virginia. Here’s a
                brief memoir of his <a href="documents/Underground_Tablet.pdf">adventures underground</a> formatted
                for tablet, also available in <a href="documents/Underground_eReader.pdf">large print</a>
                and in <a href="documents/Underground.epub">e-pub format</a>. After
                graduating from the University of Maryland in 1971 with a BS in Aerospace Engineering, he married
                <a href="partners.html#katherineHaberWright">Kathy Haber</a> and joined the US Navy as a
                <a href="documents/CharlieNavyFlightLog.pdf">Naval Flight officer</a>. The Navy sent them to Guam where

                  Mitchell</a> were born, and Charlie enjoyed duty in Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan, and other
                locations in the western Pacific. Charlie and Kathy have documented these years in a <a
                  href="documents/seaStory.pdf">memoir</a>. Before completing his Navy service in 1977, he returned to
                school at the University of West Florida to earn a BS degree in Computer Science. Subsequently, he
                enjoyed long a career as a software developer, systems engineer, and program manager developing and
                integrating information systems for the US Department of Defense while working for Sperry Univac,
                Unisys, INRI, Logicon, and Northrop Grumman. Retired in 2008, Charlie and Kathy now live in Reston VA,
                where they enjoy traveling and visiting their two daughters and seven grandchildren.

                Katie attended St. Bernadette's grade school (grades 1-8) and Regina High School in Hyattsville (grades
                9-12). She got her AA degree from Montgomery College in Rockville and continued at the University of
                Maryland where she graduated with a "General Studies" BA degree which was essentially a way to forgo
                declaring a major.

              <p class="long-copy">
                After three years of living in sin, Greg and Katie eloped and were married in Berkeley Springs. West
                Virginia at Rob and Sandy Campbell's house; Rob is Greg's cousin. Upon revealing the news to her
                parents, her father said, "Oh, thank god, I don't think I could have taken another wedding!" They moved
                to a tiny, one-bedroom apartment in Hyattsville MD where Joe was born in 1984. Soon after they
                moved to a townhouse in the Greenbelt MD Cooperative, Greenbelt Homes Inc (GHI). Katie continued
                to work while Greg took a break from his remodeling business and watched baby Joe. Monica was born in
                1987 at which time Greg and Katie switched roles with Greg working and Katie watching the kids. In 1986,
                they heard about a group that bought and subdivided a tract of land in Greenbelt. As a carpenter by
                trade, Greg had always wanted to build his own home, so they jumped at the chance and grabbed one of the
                last two available lots. They began the happy process of designing the home of their dreams. In May
                1988,
                Greg began working full-time on their home, building it in nine months. They moved into their new home
                at 156 Research Road on New Years Eve 1988. On New Years Day they awoke in their new home to a yard
                magically decorated by an overnight snow storm.

              <p class="long-copy">
                After working as a secretary, at her brother Charlie's insistence that she would make a great computer
                programmer, Katie searched for work in that field. This was in the early days of that field before the
                proliferation of computer science degree programs and professional certifications. Companies would hire
                and train people in the field. Katie joined a company as a technical writer (hired solely on the basis
                of one technical writing course taken in college that her father insisted she list on her resume). For
                any employee that could pass a computer aptitude test, the Company offered a free, year-long computer
                programming training course at night followed by a computer programmer position. The aptitude test was
                three
                hours long and had only three questions, all logic questions, no specific technical knowledge required.
                Katie used all three hours but scored 100% on the test. After the training she began working as a
                programmer
                on mainframes using COBOL and JCL software. She worked on various government contracts for
                Departments of Energy and Labor to name a few. She eventually made the jump from government contractor
                to government employee when she was hired by the Office of the Comptroller for the Currency (OCC) which
                is part of the Treasury Department. Katie thrived at the OCC and was able to make the necessary
                technical transitions from mainframes and sequential programming to PC's and database programming and
                finally web-based design. Katie loved those 20+ years of technical work. But due to the need for
                competent Project Managers, she eventually got pushed into that side of the work and out of the
                technical work that she loved. While she could be depended on to deliver her projects on time and on
                budget, Katie found the work to be tedious and mostly joyless. Out of boredom, she made the jump to the
                OCC's Cybersecurity department but again was relegated to the bureaucratic side of things (compliance
                work) instead of the more engaging and fun technical work which was reserved for contractors. </p>
              <p class="long-copy">
                Katie was thrilled to be able to retire when her first grandson was born in 2016 and has not looked back
                since. Katie and Greg watch the grandkids weekday afternoons and have spent many a summer day with them
                around the kiddie pool and sprinkler. Katie has also become active in volunteer work in several local
                Greenbelt groups and one county-wide group, the Prince George's County Lynching Memorial Project (<a
                href="https://pgclmp.org/">PGC LMP</a>) for which she is co-secretary. The PGC LMP is affiliated with
                the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI). Both organizations are committed towards educating people about our
                nation's full history, especially with respect to slavery and racial terror lynchings, and how that
                history continues to shape our present. Katie became more attuned to the issues of racial justice as she
                raised her family in Prince George's County, a majority Black county. In retirement, Katie and Greg also
                took two eye-opening car trips to various Civil Rights related sites. The first, In
                2018 was to Memphis TN and MS. Highlights included: the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis
                which includes the Lorraine Motel where MLK Jr. was assassinated, the flat cotton fields of the
                Mississippi delta, hearing music at "Red's," one of the last surviving juke joints in Clarksdale MS,
                memorial for Fannie Lou Hamer in Ruleville MS, Bryant's Grocery where Emmett Till was accused of
                flirting with the white shopkeeper, Medgar Evers' Home in Jackson MS where he was assassinated in 1963.
                The second in 2019 was to GA and AL. Highlights included: Easter service at MLK's Ebenezer
                Baptist Church in Atlanta GA, Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham AL where a bomb killed 4
                young girls, Selma AL where we walked across the Edmund Pettus bridge, the site of "Bloody Sunday" in
                1965 and most of all, EJI's powerfully moving Legacy Museum and National Memorial for Peace and Justice
                in Montgomery AL. It was this visit to EJI's museum and memorial that inspired Katie to become active in
                the PGC LMP. </p>

                Martha grew up in Silver Spring MD, graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park, and
                married her high school sweetheart, Gary Toth. With a draft lottery number that guaranteed Vietnam Era
                military service, Gary joined the U.S. Air Force in 1971. During two years of helicopter pilot training,
                he and Martha moved every few months to another middle-of-nowhere “garden spot.” During three years
                living near Clark Air Base in the Philippines, she went from an unpaid teaching aide to a teacher and
                on-site administrator of an adult high school on base.
              </p>
              <p class="long-copy">
                When they returned to the States in late 1976, Martha was pregnant with their daughter, Leilah, and Gary
                switched from Search and Rescue to Special Operations. Anxious to leave the service before he got
                killed, he took an offer from Ford to work in Dearborn as an engineer. Their daughter Valerie was born
                in Michigan, where Martha occupied herself with volunteer work for several years, first creating and
                running a parent advocacy group for the education of gifted children, then volunteering 20 hours a week
                in a gifted program classroom. She eventually served for a bit over 25 years on her local school board,
                during which she tried to become a lay expert on the theory and practice of teaching and learning.
              </p>
              <p class="long-copy">
                She returned to paid work at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1991, where she did writing,
                editing, publication design, and database management for the education outreach program of an NSF-funded
                research center. She was also an early webmaster as the Web succeeded Gopher, in the era of Mosaic and
                modems, building an expansive site of hands-on science activities.
              </p>
              <p class="long-copy">
                A few months after Martha was laid off by the university (the minute education outreach was no longer
                required), Gary was alerted to his Stage IV cancer by a sudden loss of speech—due to the largest of
                “innumerable” brain metastases. For nearly three years, he went through every possible standard (and a
                few experimental) treatments. He was able to see Leilah marry and Valerie graduate from college. Both
                girls were graduate students in Ann Arbor during much of this period, which was a blessing to all.
                Martha was able to work part-time for the non-profit formed by her education outreach group to continue
                their mentoring programs and, with two colleagues, write a book on the most important lessons they
                learned during 20-some years of such work.
              </p>
              <p class="long-copy">
                After losing Gary in 2005, she did some international traveling—to Jordan and Paris with sister Anne,
                and to Denmark, Greece, and Australia with her daughters. After Leilah and Brett settled in the Seattle
                area, Valerie and Darius settled in the DC Metro area, and both couples bought homes and had children,
                Martha realized they were never coming back to Michigan and chose to move to Seattle herself. She lives
                a few blocks from Leilah, Brett, and granddaughter Suren, and (except during pandemics) visits a few
                times a year with Valerie, Darius, and grandsons Demetrius and Marcus—now living in Silver Spring near
                her starting place.
