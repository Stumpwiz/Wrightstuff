  <p class="poem-western">True love&rsquo;s the gift which God has
    given<br/>
    To man alone beneath the heaven:<br/>
    It is not fantasy&rsquo;s
    hot fire,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose wishes, soon as granted
    fly;<br/>
    It liveth not in fierce desire,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
    dead desire it doth not die;<br/>
    It is the secret sympathy,<br/>
    The
    silver link, the silken tie,<br/>
    Which heart to heart and mind to
    mind<br/>
    In body and in soul, can bind. &ndash; Sir Walter Scott</p>

  <p class="western">To all the women in my life, from mother to
    granddaughters; and those beyond the family, particularly the good
    teachers Mrs. Drake, Sisters Mary Grace, Theresa and Regina; and
    most especially to the assorted <i>Catherines</i>, each of whom has
    mightily contributed to my life in a variety of unique ways: my wife
    Kathleen; daughter KT and Sister Kathleen; the biographer par
    excellence Catherine Drinker Bowen; and St. Catherine of Siena.</p>
  <p class="poem-western"><br/>
    The goal of life is the knowledge and
    love,<br/>
    the vision and enjoyment, of divinity; what<br/>
    happiness
    we get in this life will be through<br/>
    an imperfect knowledge or
    love of God, either<br/>
    in Himself, or in the mirrorings of
    divinity<br/>
    which we call creatures. &ndash; Walter Farrell</p>

    was complete, he sent the digital files to a company that
    specialized in printing self-published books. The original (and, as
    of this writing, only!) printing run consisted of fewer than 20
    copies.</p>
  <p class="western">All of that took place before the venerable PC
    became ubiquitous, and well before Microsoft Windows was commonly
    available, with applications such as Microsoft Word or other more
    sophisticated word-processing programs. Fancy stylistic attributes
    such as multiple fonts, colors, and graphics were simply unavailable
    at that time. Even such seemingly simple things as changing from one
    type size to another were almost impossible given the technology of
    the time. The original manuscript files were stored in the
    proprietary Paper Clip format on a collection of single-sided,
    8-inch floppy disks. Each floppy disk had sufficient capacity to
    hold only about 128,000 characters &ndash; typically one or two
    chapters of the book.</p>
  <p class="western">As Charlie and Martha began production of the
    digital second edition in the early Fall of 2014, we though it would
    be interesting to provide some insight into it preparation. In the
    late 1990s, shortly after Jack died, some who did not receive a copy
    of the first edition from the original print run expressed an
    interest in the book.
  </p>
  <p class="western">However, printing additional copies of the book
    was not feasible. It was prepared for distribution at a reunion of
    Jack&rsquo;s children at National Harbor, in Oxen Hill, MD as the
    20th anniversary of Kathleen Wright&rsquo;s passing approached &ndash;
    19 years since Jack himself left us.
  </p>
  <p class="western">Martha took on the task of trying to reconstruct
    a digital copy of the manuscript. Paper Clip was no longer available
    to read the original files. Moreover, due to technological advances,
    even finding a PC capable of reading the original 8-inch floppy
    disks was becoming more and more difficult. Luckily, Gary Toth, ever
    the tech guy, had inherited Jack&rsquo;s original Commodore-64 and,
    when upgrading to a pre-Windows PC years later, had thought to
    transfer the files. In the absence of an 8-inch floppy disk, there
    was no simple, physical way to move them between incompatible
    machines. To accomplish that, a truly Rube Goldberg-esque lash-up
    was employed: the Commodore-64&rsquo;s 300-baud modem was used to
    transmit the files one-by-one &ndash; each requiring an entire
    overnight period send the files from the Commodore-64 to the PC at
    that painfully slow rate.</p>
  <p class="western">Then came the task of transforming the recovered
    Paper Clip files into something understandable by one of the
    available word processing programs. Most of the text was salvaged,
    but none of the formatting of the original manuscript survived the
    transition. <u>Everything</u> had to be re-edited. In addition, some
    files were unreadable and several hundred pages of the original text
    were lost and had to be manually transcribed from the printed
    copies. Charlie and Martha collaborated in entering that text and
    editing those original recovered electronic files, eventually
    producing <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">the
    </font></font>digital second edition.</p>
  <p class="western">Having gone through all that trouble to recreate
    the book in digital form, we wanted to make sure that future
    generations would not have to repeat the ordeal of transcribing from
    one format to another. We had to decide on a file/format for the
    newly-recovered digital version. Using Microsoft Word (2010/2013 for
    both PC and Mac) we produced several different versions, each in a
    format common in 2014.</p>
  <p class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Comparing
  </font></font>the second edition to the original 1985 printed first
    edition you will see that this is not a &ldquo;warts-and-all&rdquo;
    faithful reproduction. For the second edition we immediately
    dismissed the original dot-matrix Courier font in favor of a more
    readable one. We tried to capture all the italics, quotes, and other
    stylistic attributes of the original; though certainly more than a
    few were probably missed. <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Although
    </font></font>we did correct a few spelling errors, add an
    occasional missing word, or remove a stray extra word here or there
    when mistakes were obvious; we have resisted the urge to make any
    intentional editorial changes to content. <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">We
    </font></font>have made no attempt to remove or reword odd or
    potentially offensive attempts at humor. This is, after all, Jack&rsquo;s
    book. Also, although we did significant proof-reading, we did not go
    any extraordinary lengths to compare the text of the second edition
    to the original word-for-word.</p>
  <p class="western">We note that, while transcribing the missing
    portions, we did find that the digital files were not always
    identical to the printed version. In those cases, we &lsquo;corrected&rsquo;
    the text you read here to match that of the printed first edition.
    We noted other occasional minor differences between the recovered
    files and the printed text and updated the text here to match the
    printed version. Clearly, Jack had done some last-minute editing
    before going to press and the recovered files did not reflect the
    &lsquo;final&rsquo; version that he sent to press. Likely, we have
    missed other such small changes.</p>
  <p class="western">One of the resources we used, as we worked our
    way through this effort, was Jack&rsquo;s personal copy of the book.
    As you might guess, that copy had numerous passages highlighted or
    underlined. <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
      addition</font></font>, we found notes written in the margins and
    newspaper clippings slipped in between the pages. To capture those
    additional thoughts for the digital editions, we added numerous
    <i>End</i><i>notes</i><span style="font-style: normal">. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Speaking
	of notes, while </span>reading, you will occasionally encounter
    &ldquo;asides&rdquo; and parenthetical comments within the text,
    sometimes preceded by the notation &ldquo;<b>Editor&rsquo;s Note</b>.&rdquo;
    Such comments reflect additions that Jack made during his final
    editing process. <b>These</b><b> are part of the original text</b> &ndash;
    not something that we added.</p>
  <p class="western">Our biggest challenge, and the main impetus to
    undertaking this effort in the first place, was to assure a digital
    second edition in a format that would remain viable for some time
    into the future. We realized that it would be valuable to make sure
    that the digital product would be compatible with as many of the
    various contemporary reading options as possible &ndash; options
    that were not even envisioned, much less available, when the first
    edition was written &ndash; such as might be read directly on PCs,
    tablets, e-readers, smart-phones, and the like. In the end, we
    decided to produce multiple formats that would support browsers and
    eReaders available at the time.</p>
  <p class="western">One obvious difference in the digital editions
    relates to placement of the pictures. Time constraints prevented
    <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">inclusion
      of </font></font>the photos in the second edition before the 2014
    reunion at National Harbor and so it does not include any of the
    pictures <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">from
    </font></font>the printed first edition. The third edition corrected
    that flaw. For <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">the
      third edition</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
      version,</font></font> we chose to integrate the photos with the
    text, for a better reader experience. Placement of the photos within
    the text of the third edition is almost entirely the result of <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">our
      sometimes arbitrary </font></font>decisions and we accept all blame
    for any perceived misplacement. When original photos were <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">found</font></font>,
    they were used &ndash; some are even in color! And Charlie took the
    liberty of adding a few new pictures. Sadly, though, most of the
    original photos and artwork were lost and had to be scanned from the
    printed original book. We spent considerable time attempting to
    touch up or otherwie improve the poor-quality of these reproductions
    as best we could. Still, some images <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">remain
    </font></font>quite small and details may be difficult for a reader
    to discern &ndash; especially in images which were re-sized, Xeroxed
    copies of newspaper and magazine articles and other printed
    documents. The text of such images is provided in <i>Endnotes </i><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">s</font></font>o
    that readers can actually have the benefit of reading the text of
    such pictures.</p>
  <p class="western">We hope you enjoy the result!</p>

    FOREWORD</h2>
  <p class="western">I was at once amused and touched when my daughter
    KT first suggested, and Sr. Kathleen endorsed the idea, that I write
    my autobiography. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine anyone profiting from the
    recitation of such a dull and ordinary tale. It is still probable
    that my work will be little read and even less enjoyed, but there is
    no longer any doubt in my mind as to why the construction of my
    life&rsquo;s story has been a very good thing. Perhaps English
    historian William Stubbs sums up my main discovery best: &ldquo;If a
    man wishes to learn something of a subject, his best policy is to
    write a book upon it.&rdquo; While it has long been my practice to
    write analyses of troubling issues, the steady evolution of
    self-knowledge that came with the development of this autobiography
    was a continuing series of shocks and surprises. My experience only
    verifies Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s observation to the effect that every
    man&rsquo;s life is best written by himself (although he then went
    on to concede that his opportunities to know it were more than
    compensated for by his temptations to disguise it.) Perhaps the best
    reason why one should write his own life story is that advanced by
    historian Joseph Renana: One should only write about what one loves.
    This, then, has at worst been a labor of love and enlightenment for
    the author. One can only hope that it can be as much to at least a
    few readers.</p>
  <p class="western">But the project has, indeed, been labor. Apart
    from the shock of really confronting myself for the first time, my
    second biggest discovery has been that the writing of autobiography
    has to be the most difficult type of writing in the world. Whereas
    Carlyle has remarked that a well-written one is much rarer, and
    proceeds to convict Carlyle of being &ldquo;as much an optimist in
    his criticism as he was a pessimist in his ethics.&rdquo; Indeed,
    the seeker of truth in autobiography will eventually become a devout
    convert to pessimism. There are many reasons for this. First of all,
    one is overcome by the astonishing number and length of blank
    periods in one&rsquo;s life. This frustration is particularly acute
    as regards one&rsquo;s first decade on earth. This unhappy situation
    has prompted at least one wag to suggest that all biographies should
    start with Chapter Two. Kipling has underscored the vital importance
    of this blank period with his challenge to &ldquo;Give me the first
    six years of a child&rsquo;s life; and you can have the rest.&rdquo;
    Yet, as Andre Maurois has noted, he could recall only a few
    outstanding memories up to the age of seven or eight. He has
    remarked that they appeared as tiny, isolated pictures surrounded on
    both sides by dark strands of forgetfulness, and he went on to state
    that, &ldquo;This is not enough to explain the complex individuality
    which we all acquire by the age of six or seven.&rdquo; If Kipling
    is right, and my reflection strongly suggests that he is, then the
    most careful dredging of the subconscious for even the seeming
    trivia of these highly formative years appears to be fully
    warranted.</p>
  <p class="western">There are other very real constraints operating
    against truth in autobiography. In the first place, hardly anyone
    has any real enthusiasm for confessing personal stupidity, much less
    personal shame. On the other hand, few would have the temerity to
    assume any vested right to violate the reputation or peace of mind
    of any figure peripheral to the story. English writer Philip
    Guedalla says that autobiography is an unrivaled vehicle for telling
    the truth about other people. Death Valley Scotty&rsquo;s credo
    seems most apt: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say nothing that will hurt
    anybody.&rdquo; Yet, we are surely shaped in some considerable
    measure by both the positive and the negative influences of those
    who share our environment. How can our hero realistically project
    the full story of his development without at some point incidentally
    incriminating some of the supporting players? An extremely fine
    sense of discretion is needed in such instances, for no one has the
    right to tell the whole truth (as they admittedly see it
    imperfectly) about others. Nevertheless, one must recognize that
    such discretion in fact operates as a distorting filter even under
    the best circumstances.</p>
  <p class="western">Nor is this the end of the problems with
    autobiography &ndash; other more subtle constraints yet remain.
    Maurois has contended on the one hand that autobiography is obliged
    to omit the many commonplaces of daily life to concentrate on the
    salient events, actions, and traits, but he has also conceded that
    in so doing one creates the impression that our hero&rsquo;s life
    was one smooth tapestry of main events, whereas the great bulk of
    the unrecorded hours were much as dull as our own. On the other
    hand, Sir Walter Raleigh in effect goes even further, suggesting
    that accidents which may seem little more than trifles often develop
    qualities every bit as much as participation in great worldly
    events. As for these so-called great events, their recounting
    likewise entails peril. English philosopher Henry Spencer has
    observed that to omit incidents that mark the progress of our hero&rsquo;s
    development and success diminishes the value of the narrative, but
    to the extent that such reflect any honor on him, their mere mention
    often translates into charges of vanity. Maurois extends the figure
    by noting that memory rationalizes; ascribing lofty motives for
    actions performed unwittingly or unconsciously. Clearly, pursuit of
    truth in autobiography is as vain and illusive as pursuit of a
    will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp.</p>
  <p class="western">We must conclude with Maurois that the severest
    autobiography remains a piece of special pleading, and that when we
    attempt our own portrait for other people, we should not be
    surprised if the portrait is not accepted as a likeness. As Spencer
    has said, &ldquo;An autobiography is a medium which produces some
    irremediable distortion.&rdquo; Will Rogers has reinforced this with
    his wry observation to the effect that when you put down the good
    stuff that you should have done, and you leave out the bad stuff
    that you did do, well, that&rsquo;s memoirs. As several wags have
    noted, &ldquo;Autobiography is now as common as adultery, and hardly
    less reprehensible.&rdquo; All the foregoing, of course, is merely
    to forge the proper perspective with regard to all that follows, and
    incidentally to explain the newly compounded word in our subtitle.
    As for the perspective, we yield to Isadora Duncan: &ldquo;How can
    we write the truth about ourselves? Do we even know it? There is the
    vision our friends have of us; and the vision we have of ourselves;
    the vision our lover has of us, the vision our enemies have of us &ndash;
    all of these visions are different.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">As for titles, we found that all the good ones
    have already been used. We liked the casualness of Graham Greene&rsquo;s
    <i>A Sort of Life</i>, and we cherished Oscar Levant&rsquo;s <i>A
      Smattering of Ignorance</i> as even more apt. <i>Something of Myself
      For My Friends Known and Unknown</i> seemed just perfect. Too bad
    Kipling disposed of that one. And, had we wished to be more
    profound, we might have opted for <i>By Any Name</i>; the same being
    excerpted from American humorist Donald Robert Perry Marquis&rsquo;s
    awesome declaration, &ldquo;All religions, all life, all art, all
    expressions come down to this: to the effort of the human soul to
    break through its barrier of loneliness, of intolerable loneliness,
    and make contact with another seeking soul, or with what all souls
    seek, which is (by any name) God!&rdquo; We finally settled upon the
    one we selected because it seemed at once both so historically
    right, and (please be kind) so characteristically <i>Wright</i>.
    You&rsquo;ll find no apology here, either, for the quagmire of
    quotes. They are not, as one might reasonably suspect, an accidental
    betrayal of pseudo-intellectualism. Rather, they are willfully
    incorporated as insurance against the customary clich&eacute;,
    &ldquo;Well, it was all very interesting, but I didn&rsquo;t learn
    anything new.&rdquo; With this single disavowal on record, then, and
    with due acknowledgment to Samuel Eliot Morison (for Volume Three of
    his <i>Oxford History of the American People</i>) and even more so
    to William Manchester (for his <i>The Glory and the Dream</i>),
    whose superb historical narratives contributed mightily to my
    ability to recreate and chronologically structure personal
    reflections and experiences in relation to the appropriately
    contemporary atmospherics and events, we are now ready to proceed.
    No one can plead that they haven&rsquo;t been forewarned.</p>

  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western">The best brought-up children are
    those who have seen their parents as they are. Hypocrisy is not the
    parent&rsquo;s first duty.<span style="font-style: normal">
	&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;G.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Shaw</span></p>
  <p class="western">The central basis for all the major decisions of
    my life has been flight from my mother. Despite the carefully
    cultivated and quite public image to the contrary, she simply was
    not an easy person to love. She always seemed to keep you at arm&rsquo;s
    length, and certainly she was the world&rsquo;s champion
    faultfinder. Like a teacher, she assumed as a divine mission a
    constant right and responsibility to correct anyone, anywhere,
    anytime. Nothing, but nothing, ever suited her. It&rsquo;s already
    almost a family joke &ndash; &ldquo;Mother will surely make it to
    heaven, but she&rsquo;s not going to like it there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">She didn&rsquo;t just keep house. And she
    certainly didn&rsquo;t provide a home in which you could relax. What
    she did was maintain a showcase, always ready to receive visitors
    who rarely came. I firmly believe that it had to be her who coined
    the phrase, Everything has a place: everything in its place. No one
    in the family ever enjoyed our so-called living room. Except for the
    occasional welcoming of a relative, our living room was
    out-of-bounds. Smoking wasn&rsquo;t then the rage it was later to
    become, but, if mother had allowed smoking at all, she would have
    been constantly on the move dumping and washing each ash tray after
    each flick of a cigarette. She could spy a piece of lint on a rug at
    30 paces, maybe 50. Too bad they never gave prizes for museum-like
    living rooms as they sometimes do for outside gardens.</p>
  <p class="western">And there were never any halfway measures. Mother
    never got merely sick. She always got deathly sick. She never had a
    simple ache or pain. It was always an excruciating pain. She never
    felt just slightly warm or chilly. She was either dying of the heat
    or freezing to death. Amazing as it may seem, I never recognized
    what was wrong until very recently, in the course of enjoying one of
    John D. MacDonald&rsquo;s <i>Travis McGee</i> adventure novels. I
    can&rsquo;t do better in describing mother than by quoting MacDonald
    directly:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Some of the classic symptoms of anxiety
    neurosis: the numbness, vivid and ugly dreams of something wrong
    with your body, diarrhea, depression, self-contempt. There are
    others: double vision, incontinence, and being always too hot or too
    cold, night sweats &hellip; an only child. A lot of pressure on you
    to be the best child ever. Impossible goal, of course. Sense of
    failure at not making it. So your mother died at peak vulnerability,
    and then your father died, and you never had a chance to prove to
    them you could hack it in the world&hellip; So, out of a sense of
    being terribly alone, you marry a very large and sort of limited
    guy. And it was the pursuit of perfection. You had all the images
    and symbols working for you.</p>
  <p class="western">That&rsquo;s mother to a tee! She made a career
    of illness, real and imaginary, but always exaggerated. And while
    she wasn&rsquo;t an only child, her mother died when she was
    sixteen, and her father when she was twenty. So, indeed, she never
    did have a chance to prove herself, and the scarred sense of
    self-worth (or, better said, &ldquo;unworth&rdquo;) endured almost
    to the day of her death. Not only did she lose both parents before
    making it in the world, the entire balance of her immediate family
    was wiped out by tuberculosis in the space of a mere dozen years;
    the four brothers before she was twenty-two, her only sister before
    she was twenty-seven. None of her siblings saw their thirtieth
    birthday.</p>
  <p class="western">All of this certainly had to be traumatic, and it
    apparently devastated mother. She must have felt incredibly alone &ndash;
    utterly abandoned and at peak vulnerability, since in those days
    young women were even more discriminated against than they are
    today. True, she in no sense married a very limited guy, but
    subsequently clear incompatibilities suggest that her marriage to a
    young college professor was a precipitate flight from insecurity
    into a cozy cultural realm which, like that of naval officers,
    confers certain inherent trappings of prestige and more-than-average
    respectability. You have all the images and symbols working for you.
    And the latter is what mother seemingly lived by. With her the
    important thing was always, &ldquo;What will people think?&rdquo;
    and &ldquo;But people will see you.&rdquo; Appearance was
    everything. Too bad she could never undergo the third degree of the
    Knights of Columbus.</p>
  <p class="western">I have no recollection of mother ever having
    volunteered a single positive remark about anything or anybody. When
    she beheld a rose, she saw only the thorns. If there be such awards,
    she fully merits exclusive rights to the title of Miss Pessimist of
    the years 1888 through 1981. Little wonder that I&rsquo;ve always
    felt ambivalent about Mother&rsquo;s Day. I just never could
    understand what all the shouting was about. My main impulse about
    mother was to run &ndash; to run away, far and fast. This was an
    impulse not shared by either my lone sister, Margaret, or by my lone
    brother, Tom, at least until many, many years later. Margaret was
    three years older than I, and Tom was four and one-half years
    younger than I. From the very outset my mother made it very clear
    that I enjoyed a much less favorable position than either my sister
    or my brother.</p>

    With sister, Margaret</h3>
  <p class="western">First of all, my sister Margaret, being the
    eldest, naturally inherited the alter-parent role and authority
    whenever both my mother and father were away from home. My earliest
    and dominant recollection of sister Margaret was as an enemy; one
    who would never hesitate to do me in, and who in fact seemed to
    relish the accolades she inevitably received for reporting some
    minor (but admittedly willful) infraction on my part while the folks
    were out. More often than not she baited me into the indiscretion
    with the admonition, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not do so-and-so, or
    I&rsquo;ll tell mother when she gets home.&rdquo; And I would, and
    she would, then I&rsquo;d bask in reflected glory as my mother would
    despairingly intone, &ldquo;He must be possessed by the devil.&rdquo;
    But what red-blooded American boy could ever resist a challenge like
    that? I&rsquo;m certain that one of my early delights was driving my
    officious little proxy-parent sister up the wall.</p>
  <p class="western">My brother, on the other hand, had the wisdom and
    foresight to suffer an attack of rheumatic fever at about the age of
    five or six. I remember that it delayed his completion of the first
    grade (which he ended up skipping) for a year. More than that, it
    established him for life &ndash; though he soon completely recovered
    &ndash; as <i>Poor Tom</i>! (It amuses me that, to this day, even
    his wife refers to him as <i>Poor Tom</i>.) I must have been in the
    late teens before it dawned on me that, like damn Yankees, his
    appellation of <i>Poor Tom</i> wasn&rsquo;t in fact a single word
    and his real name. This isn&rsquo;t to suggest that he either ever
    precipitated or demanded the deference with which mother insisted
    that we treat him, but he sure as hell enjoyed it. He couldn&rsquo;t
    have had a more protected and favored childhood had he been the only
    offspring of the <i>Godfather</i> and had twenty-four-hour Mafia
    guards. As for me, woe unto me if I so much as harmed a single hair
    of his head. So it was that I grew into first feeling like I was
    somewhere between a rock and a hard place &ndash; an unread book
    between two eye-catching book-ends.</p>

    Wright tribe on sister Margaret&rsquo;s graduation</h3>
  <p class="western">My father, as nearly as I can recall, always
    tried (and generally succeeded) in being extremely fair. Like St.
    Joseph, he was a just man. The trouble was, his intelligence
    apparatus, as far as I could see, was no better than our
    fumble-bumble CIA&rsquo;s. Too often he was forced to act on what I,
    at least, thought was bad, biased, or incomplete information. I
    can&rsquo;t fault him, though, for not just trying to get the facts,
    sir, like detective Joe Friday. Neither do I accuse the siblings of
    willful distortion or worse. It was sort of like how no two
    eye-witnesses ever seem to see things exactly the same, and I
    confess that early on I began to view things through a mental prism
    that filtered everything coming my way as just another manifestation
    of the let&rsquo;s-sock-it-to-Jack syndrome. It just seemed to be a
    generally shared axiom, possibly a corollary of Murphy&rsquo;s Law,
    that if anything went wrong, well, everybody just knew that I had
    caused it. Thus spurred on, I no doubt tried mightily to fulfill
    expectations, lest anyone feel cheated.</p>
  <p class="western">Like my mother, my father was also a native
    Washingtonian, as am I. And, in contrast to my mother&rsquo;s
    parents, both of my father&rsquo;s parents lived into their middle
    eighties. His father, like my mother&rsquo;s father, was what would
    probably be termed a middle-level civil servant in the federal
    government. Grandpa Blakeney was a clerk in the Auditor&rsquo;s
    Office of the Treasury Department. Grandpa Wright was the same in
    the Finance Branch of the War Department. So, the immediate roots,
    at least in terms of worldly professionalism, were not especially
    distinguished. We would probably call both families
    lower-middle-class today. My father was one of two boys, and he had
    six sisters. I am surprised as I try to write this how little I know
    about my father&rsquo;s siblings. Two of the sisters had died before
    I was a year old. Two of the others, Edna and Alma, were married,
    and between them they had five sons. Of the other two, Edith
    ultimately retired from the government, where she worked for
    something like the Department of Education. The other, Sue, I only
    remember as a life-long cripple from arthritis. All lived to
    advanced years. My father&rsquo;s only and younger brother Eliot,
    also married, and is probably best recognized by some of my children
    in conjunction with his wife, Aunt Agnes, now widowed in Ormond
    Beach, Florida. We will meet them again in the course of this story.</p>

    Early Pop</h3>
  <p class="western">Naturally I can disclose many more particulars
    about my father than about any other member of his family. In
    addition to personal recollections, I have the benefit of a brief
    formal biography<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote1anc" href="#sdendnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a>
    of him. It is part of a dissertation prepared in 1955 by Ann Martha
    Sandberg of the Catholic University. She subtitles this biography
    &ldquo;Advocate of Peace,&rdquo; and in it she describes him as
    having &ldquo;a dynamic personality, vivid imagination, keen
    intellect, tireless energy, and a cultured mind.&rdquo; He was all
    of this, plus, from my point of view at least, he was a good father
    and an exceedingly patient and thoughtful husband. He graduated from
    Georgetown University in 1911 and added his master&rsquo;s and
    doctorate degrees at Catholic University in 1912 and 1916. He could
    boast a reading knowledge of German, French, Spanish, Italian and
    Portuguese &ndash; most probably as a by-product of his great
    facility in Latin, in which he was an instructor at Catholic
    University from 1911 to 1918. It was in pursuing his study of Latin
    that he virtually fell into his ultimate field of International Law
    and Political Science. This all came about through his doing his
    master&rsquo;s thesis on St. Augustine&rsquo;s idea of peace, and
    his subsequent critical analysis of Franciscus de Victoria&rsquo;s
    treatise on the so-called just war, for his advanced degree, a
    Doctorate in Philosophy. (I deeply regret that I never got to ask my
    father the precise origin of the topics for these two dissertations,
    since they were so evidently critical and seemingly providential in
    directing the eventual course of his highly successful professional
    life.)</p>
  <p class="western">The latter critique literally launched his career
    as an expert in International Law, eliciting an invitation to join a
    branch of the <i>Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</i> to
    assist in the translation of <i>Classics of International Law</i>.
    He progressed from this position in 1923 to assume the chair of
    Political Science in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown
    University where he served until 1930. While in the latter billet,
    Pop (which is what we always called him) made his first European
    visitation in 1926 as part of the Carnegie Endowment contingent of
    fifty professors who were reviewing the operations of various
    international organizations first-hand. Concurrently, he was the
    managing editor of the <i>Constitutional Review</i> of the State
    Department for several years. In 1919 he became a special advisor in
    historical research for the State Department in Latin American
    Affairs. Subsequently, the State Department assigned him to edit
    some international conferences in 1929&ndash;1930, this stint
    entailing four months&rsquo; service in the American Delegation to
    the London Naval Conference in 1930.</p>
  <p class="western">Also, in 1930, Pop received an honorary degree of
    Doctor of Law from Providence College in Rhode Island, and received
    the Papal Cross Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice from Pius XII for his
    Vice-Chairmanship of the Catholic University&rsquo;s Golden Jubilee
    celebration. He had, on his return from London in 1930, joined the
    Catholic University as Professor of International Law and Head of
    the Department of Political Science, which post he still held at the
    time of his sudden death (of a heart attack) in 1945. Concurrently
    with this assignment he lectured for several semesters on
    International Law, American diplomacy, and Latin and Far Eastern
    affairs at the Postgraduate School of the U.S. Naval Academy and at
    the Turner Diplomatic School. Concurrently with all the foregoing,
    he authored more than two hundred publications pertaining to
    International Law and Political Science over the period extending
    from 1912 to his death in 1945, the same culminating with his
    comparative study of <i>The Dumbarton Oak Proposals and the Covenant
      of the League of Nations</i> which was published as a government
    document by Congressional Order, for use of the United Nations
    Conference at San Francisco beginning on 25 April 1945, and which
    resulted in the United Nations organization.</p>
  <p class="western">Such is Pop&rsquo;s curriculum vitae &ndash;
    impressive, but not really revelatory of the man, or better the
    gentleman, for that is what he was, in the fullest sense of the
    word. He was courteous, forthright, compassionate, exceedingly
    patient, and quietly courageous. Also, he was ever a cheerful
    companion, a fascinating conversationalist never at a loss for just
    the right anecdote with which to underscore a point. He was also a
    devout optimist and a perpetual student. I don&rsquo;t ever recall
    him relaxing without pen or book in hand. It&rsquo;s not at all
    surprising that two of his best friends comment upon his reading
    habits. &ldquo;We read a great deal,&rdquo; volunteered his
    life-long boyhood chum, Fr. Quitman Beckley, O.P. &ldquo;He was
    always reading learned books,&rdquo; is how another old friend,
    historian Charles Tansil, underscored the matter. And he didn&rsquo;t
    just read them. He absorbed them.</p>
  <p class="western">I suppose the dichotomy of affection in my mind
    for my mother and father is already abundantly evident, and I can
    only add, well, this is the way it was as I emerged into awareness
    and then grew into young manhood. Pop was friend; Mom was foe. And
    my brother and sister registered pretty much as self-seeking
    neutrals with Pop, and as allies of Mom. Rightly or wrongly, I saw
    things from the very beginning as being me against the world, with
    Pop as my only hope and refuge, but as a strict dispenser of
    justice. Mercy was still just an unknown <i>x</i> in the equation of
    my young life. One can do no more, especially this belatedly, than
    record one&rsquo;s best impressions.</p>
  <p class="western">Having said all this, some attempt must yet be
    made, I suppose, to elaborate those specific qualities in my
    father&rsquo;s overall character to which I may have fallen heir to
    varying degrees. Even as it was in the case of my mother, it remains
    for another to best delineate the unique character of my father. Let
    us defer to Catherine Drinker Bowen:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The professor is deliberate, he dislikes
    snap judgments, clever retorts at the expense of sincerity. There is
    a primal delightful innocence in him; he tells a funny story with
    all the gusto of Adam telling it for the first time to Eve. And he
    is tough fibered in his profession: a scorching review of his latest
    book is published in the historical quarterly [she happened to be
    writing of a history professor], and next Christmas holiday the
    author sits with the reviewer at the historians&rsquo; convention,
    companionably drinking beer in the hotel bar. The professors laugh
    at themselves, they laugh at life; they long ago abjured the
    bitch-goddess SUCCESS, and the best of them will fight for his
    scholastic ideals with a courage and persistence that would shame a
    soldier. The professor is not afraid of words like truth; in fact he
    is not afraid of words at all. Like the lawyer he loves to talk and
    teach, likes to exercise his mind and know he does it well. But
    unlike the lawyer, the professor has a wonderful confidence,
    somehow, that there is time to talk.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, I certainly can&rsquo;t add a thing to
    that. That&rsquo;s my Pop! But one final word anent both parents by
    yet another author strikes me as most relevant. He is speaking of
    his own derivative character in terms of his father as a teacher.
    Now, whereas my mother&rsquo;s claim to being a teacher arises
    solely from the fact of her motherhood, she was by all accounts an
    indefatigable teacher, every bit as much as my father was a
    professional one. I therefore feel the following words of Andre
    Maurois are most apt with respect to my legacy from both of my
    parents:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">My father passed all of his life in
    teaching&hellip; No one will deny that I am much given to criticism.
    Along with the exposition of my own views there has always gone a
    pointing out of the defects in the views of others&hellip; The
    tendency of fault-finding is dominant &ndash; disagreeably dominant.
    The indication of errors in thought and in speech made by those
    around, has all through life been an incurable habit &ndash; a habit
    for which I have often reproached myself, but to no purpose. Whence
    this habit?&hellip; (Again), while one half of a teacher&rsquo;s
    time is spent in exposition, the other half is spent in criticism in
    detecting mistakes made by those saying their lessons, or in
    correcting exercises, or in checking calculations; and the implied
    powers, moral and intellectual, are used with a sense of a duty
    performed. And here let me add that in me, too, a sense of duty
    prompts criticism; for when, occasionally, I succeed in restraining
    myself from making a comment on something wrongfully said or
    executed, I have a feeling of discomfort, as though I&rsquo;d left
    undone something which should have been done: the inherited tendency
    is on the way to become an instinct acting automatically.</p>
  <p class="western">There you have it &ndash; like father and mother:
    like son! I wonder &hellip; would any of my children dispute this?
    So, my origins lie with my parents to a considerably more than
    merely physical degree. But it would be wrong, I think, to leave it
    at that. They, too, had their origins, and before proceeding
    further, it might be well to digress briefly and place in the record
    (and this may be the last opportunity to pass the torch in this
    respect) what little I have been able to reconstruct about my
    parents&rsquo; forebears. As it was in the case of Mom and Pop, more
    biographical data are readily available about my father&rsquo;s
    family than about my mother&rsquo;s. One reason for this is, as
    already noted, my father enjoyed a relatively distinguished
    semi-public professional life. Another is that my mother was the
    sole living member of her immediate family for the last sixty-six
    years of her life, ending in December of 1981. Unfortunately, too, I
    didn&rsquo;t personally try to pick Mom&rsquo;s brains for family
    memories until she was already going on ninety and her recollection
    was already beginning to cloud over. This sad state of affairs makes
    it all the more imperative that I now set down the full extent of
    what I know.</p>
  <p class="western">My mother&rsquo;s maiden name was Blakeney, that
    being an English family that had its origin in a town of that name
    on the northeast coast of the North Sea, barely 100 miles north of
    London in Norfolk County. It wasn&rsquo;t until the summer of 1981,
    three years after I began this project, that I discovered that the
    Blakeney name is more or less irrelevant to our ancestry. It seems
    that Grandpa Blakeney&rsquo;s original father died, and his widowed
    mother remarried a Blakeney who then formally adopted him. Actually,
    Grandpa Blakeney, though born in Sheffield, County York, England,
    was born of Irish parents with the name of <i>KELLY</i>! So it is
    that our progeny are effectively one-quarter Irish, and only barely
    (by an additional 1-1/4 sixteenths) more English. Another quarter of
    our children&rsquo;s ancestry is Bohemian, with the balance being
    Scottish and German with a trace of Spanish. (Bohemian, of course,
    is the classification of individualists noted for their disaffection
    with conventional societal manners and mores, and it would seem that
    certain of our daughters exhibit this traditional ancestral
    disposition.)</p>
  <p class="western">In all events, Grandpa KELLY arrived alone in New
    York circa 1865 at the age of eighteen, and there became a
    schoolteacher. (Notice has already been given of my contention that
    a teacher&rsquo;s correction complex has seemingly been inherited by
    me from my mother as well as my father. Perhaps my mother&rsquo;s
    father was the source of mother&rsquo;s teaching proclivity!)
    Anyhow, he soon gravitated, at the instigation of a friend who had
    preceded him from England, to the Soddy-Cleveland-Ducktown area of
    Tennessee (just east of Chattanooga and just north of the state line
    from Atlanta, Georgia), where he served as tutor to the family of a
    former English Lord. Soon thereafter, on 1 September 1867, he
    unaccountably enlisted as a Private in the U.S. Army at Memphis,
    Tennessee, under the alias of Thomas M. Nugent! (One can only
    conjecture that his flight from England and disguised entry into the
    Army were attempts to escape his mother and new stepfather, as he
    was still under 21 years of age.)</p>
  <p class="western">Although his Army commitment was for three years,
    Grandpa Kelly-Blakeney-Nugent was medically discharged after only 21
    months. First of all, he had spent most of his enlistment in base
    hospitals due to intermittent fever and chronic diarrhea contracted
    early on in a swamp area camp near Wolf Creek on the outskirts of
    Memphis. This unproductive situation was further complicated by an
    improperly healed radius of his right forearm, which was broken in
    an accidental fall down barracks steps in a troop rumble to roll
    call. This resulted in his being declared 3/4&rsquo;s unfit for
    manual labor, and so he was discharged on 1 May 1869 at Atlanta,
    Georgia. In due course Grandpa filed for and got a $4/month pension,
    and it was this latter record which enabled this tracing of his
    abortive military record. Following this military stint he returned
    to the Tennessee area where, at age 28 in 1875, he married
    15-year-old Martha Elizabeth Austin of Alabama.</p>
  <p class="western">My mother&rsquo;s mother was said to have been
    born on a plantation in Alabama, and her maternal grandmother&rsquo;s
    name is said to have been Forester. It seems that Mr. Forester was
    killed in a Civil War battle near Nashville in the first six months
    of the war, and the family soon lost track of his estate, which is
    said to have been considerable. Also, mother&rsquo;s grandmother
    soon after ended up, with one remaining loyal female slave,
    operating a boardinghouse in Ducktown. Presumably, this is where my
    maternal grandparents met. Following their marriage on 20 January
    1875, Martha bore four sons before the family removed to Washington
    in 1885 to enable Grandpa to take up a federal government job. My
    mother and her only sister, Marie, were then born in Washington.
    Mother was baptized Anna Frances Susan and opted for the single
    middle name of Cecilia at confirmation.</p>
  <p class="western">The Blakeney family, with the exception of my
    mother, was decimated between 1902 and 1915, largely by
    tuberculosis, the last to go being my mother&rsquo;s younger sister,
    Marie, who died at the age of 24. With my mother, she was a clerk in
    the U.S. Patent Office. My mother&rsquo;s four brothers died within
    the eight-year span of 1902 and 1910. All died in their twenties.
    The oldest, Will, was an aide to Admiral George Dewey, who had been
    with Farragut at Mobile Bay and who subdued the Spanish at Manila
    Bay in 1898, but who was then serving (1902-1906) as President of
    the Navy&rsquo;s General Board. Will was being groomed as naval
    attach&eacute; to Russia when he died. The second brother was John,
    also a Navy man. He is said to have made every major port in the
    world<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote2anc" href="#sdendnote2sym"><sup>2</sup></a>
    before he died at age 23. It is also said that he achieved at least
    a try-out with the old Washington baseball Senators.</p>
  <p class="western">I&rsquo;ve been unable to unearth anything about
    the third brother, Charles, except that he worked for the Weather
    Bureau. As for the youngest brother, Al, he too was a Navy man at
    least briefly. He joined up by lying about his age at 16. His mother
    quickly intercepted him at Norfolk where she engineered his release
    by proving him underage. He ended up working for the Navy Department
    in Philadelphia, where it is also said that Grandpa Blakeney&rsquo;s
    only known relative, a sister, lived. All we know about her is that
    she was married to a plumber who had a fetish for gold-plated water
    fittings throughout their house. But the only really curious
    disclosure in all of this, it seems to me, is that my maternal
    grandfather was another teacher, and that three of his sons were
    Navy-oriented. I had thought I was the first, and that I had
    established the family naval tradition in which my three living sons
    are already established. Not so. Fame is so fleeting!</p>
  <p class="western">With my father&rsquo;s family the records are a
    little more complete, going back an additional generation on his
    father&rsquo;s side and several more on his mother&rsquo;s to an
    Edward Green who was born in 1740. The amazing aspect of this side
    of the family was that it was D.C.-Maryland centered for
    generations. In fact, my paternal grandfather was an officer in the
    Association of Oldest Inhabitants of D.C. My
    great-great-great-grandfather Green had a daughter Elizabeth who was
    married to a Mr. W. W. Dorney of Harford County, Maryland, by no
    less than Archbishop John Carroll, America&rsquo;s first bishop and
    the founder of Georgetown University. Interestingly enough, Mr.
    Dorney&rsquo;s parents were named John and Martha. The Dorneys had a
    daughter, Maria Agnes, who married Mr. Benjamin Thomas Watson of
    Prince Georges County, Maryland. They in turn had a daughter,
    Susannah Cecilia, who became my father&rsquo;s mother. She was the
    youngest of nine in a family of seven girls and two boys. She
    married paternal grandfather, Johnson Eliot Wright, son of Benjamin
    C. Wright, who was born in Alexandria while it was still part of the
    District of Columbia.</p>
  <p class="western">At this point, a word is in order about one of my
    father&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s sisters &ndash; my Great-Aunt Kate.
    She is particularly relevant to our story on two accounts. First of
    all, she bears the name of one of our daughters and one of our
    granddaughters. More than that, and to my total surprise, she has to
    be our family&rsquo;s pioneer women&rsquo;s libber. I remembered her
    only as an elderly recluse who always sat quietly rocking in her
    second-story room (which she never left) on Columbia Road, in
    northwest Washington. It was somewhat of a shock to discover, upon
    reading the age-84 memoirs (written in 1961) of the husband of one
    of my father&rsquo;s sisters (a medical doctor in the Indian
    Service), that this reserved old lady had in her youth been the head
    teacher (yes, another one!) at a school for the Navajo Indians in
    New Mexico around the year 1900.</p>
  <p class="western">Not only that, she was the magnet who drew two of
    my father&rsquo;s sisters for visits to that then-still-primitive
    area, one of whom &ndash; Edna, the wife-to-be of the doctor &ndash;
    would remain to raise a family. (My father&rsquo;s sister Alma &ndash;
    another teacher &ndash; visited them sometime later.) Here was this
    young city girl, (my Aunt Edna) who had never mounted a horse
    before, suddenly full astride and slipping and sliding down tortuous
    mountain passes in darkness and in rain and after only the most
    elementary instruction: Sit straight up and let her have her head!
    Soon she was of necessity camping out, sleeping on the ground, and
    so fully integrated into the western outdoors life that she remained
    &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; to become the kindergarten teacher in
    her Aunt&rsquo;s Indian school.</p>
  <p class="western">Her husband, the doctor and author of the
    aforesaid memoirs, rates a yet-to-be-written book in his own right &ndash;
    <i>Frontier Doctor<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote3anc" href="#sdendnote3sym"><sup>3</sup></a></i>.
    We can digress here only sufficiently to indicate that through him,
    his heroic wife, and my father&rsquo;s Aunt Kate, your family had at
    least some part in the saga of how the West was won. He operated
    (and that <i>is</i> the proper word) from the general area of the
    Mesa Verde (SW corner of Colorado, NW corner of New Mexico) out of
    Fort Lewis (near Durango and north of the La Plata Mountains) to
    Fort Defiance (near Gallup). His father was the supervising engineer
    in the building of the railroad spur connecting Durango and
    Silverton. The good doctor&rsquo;s practice, in the jargon of the
    Navy, covered everything from asshole to appetite. He removed
    cataracts, did amputations, pulled teeth, and performed chest,
    abdominal and every other kind of surgery. Having passed the state
    pharmacist exam while still in college, he also compounded his own
    prescriptions from raw chemicals.</p>
  <p class="western">Still not impressed? He delivered all four of his
    own children, and personally performed the autopsy on his only
    daughter, who died at age one month due to extensive stomach
    perforation caused by ingestion of a foreign body (a sliver of glass
    or razor blade). His second son, Frank, is named after my father
    (Herbert Francis Wright), as was our own Herbie. The good doctor
    spoke Navajo, and additionally administered to the Ute, and for two
    years to the Chiricahua Apache &ndash; of whom he states, While some
    were intelligent, many were ignorant, dirty drunkards. (The Navajo
    and Apache are linguistically connected, both being Athapascan.) The
    doctor died at age 92 in Carroll Manor in June of 1964.</p>
  <p class="western">Returning now to the thread of our story, my
    father&rsquo;s father had a great uncle, Robert Wright, who was the
    Provost Marshal of Bladensburg during the Civil War. This,
    interestingly enough, is where my first grandson, another Robert
    Wright, was born. The first Robert inherited a gold watch as the
    eldest male survivor of another Wright, which was inscribed:
    &ldquo;Prescribed to _____ Wright by General Lafayette, for taking
    care of him while he was wounded.&rdquo; My father&rsquo;s father
    had another great uncle, Judge James Wright, who was Chief Librarian
    of the Department of Justice. A few further tidbits include the fact
    that the equestrian statue of General Jackson in Lafayette Park was
    designed by a gentleman named Taylor, who happened to be the husband
    of grandfather Wright&rsquo;s Aunt Martha. Another item, and one I
    personally remember, was that my grandfather used to be one of the
    surviving old-time volunteer firemen who used to pull the old
    pumping engine every Labor Day parade. He continued to do this until
    age 75, when the chore almost killed him even though they had
    youngsters helping on the lines.</p>
  <p class="western">I remember my paternal grandfather better than
    any other relative, I suppose, precisely because of the personal (if
    infrequent) interactions we shared. I recall his happily singing a
    popular song one day, <i>Go Away, Old Man, Go Away</i>, and I asked
    him how he could enjoy that song when he himself was an old man.
    Well, that earned me one big withering frown. I also remember the
    time he, my father and myself were checking out genealogy in old
    Alexandria graveyards one summer day. I was amazed when he harshly
    repelled an old beggar and said, &ldquo;Get away from me, go get a
    job!&rdquo; It was the first and probably only time I ever saw him
    exhibit the slightest discourtesy, and I was quite impressed.
    Finally, there was the time when I was a little older, and so was
    he. I tried to help him down the front porch stairs to the car when
    he was departing after a visit to our house. &ldquo;Let go of my
    arm,&rdquo; he said furiously, tearing himself out of my supporting
    grasp, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an old man yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">No doubt he was a very proud old gentleman, but
    if so, he was entitled. As one testimonial to him upon his
    retirement attests, he was &ldquo;a Christian and a polished
    gentleman of the old school, very loyal, and an assiduous worker.&rdquo;
    I can believe it! But he also had a delightful playful side. Being a
    Presbyterian, he&rsquo;d surprise my grandmother by preparing Sunday
    breakfast while she was at mass. He&rsquo;d bake new coins in the
    wheat muffins. Sometimes he even baked dollar bills into the
    muffins, having carefully inserted them into emptied walnut shells.
    And frequently, to the delight of his grandchildren, he&rsquo;d
    exclaim, Grandma, I asked you to please fix that hole in my pocket,
    as he sent us scurrying to gather assorted coins that seemingly
    showered from the allegedly defective pocket. So much, then, for
    happy personal memories.</p>
  <p class="western">As for the other insights, they were largely
    garnered from my paternal Grandpa&rsquo;s <i>Reminiscences of an
      Octogenarian</i>, which he compiled in the mid-1930s. Of these
    recollections (only lightly skimmed here) he wrote, &ldquo;I write &hellip;
    in connection with my life to show what can be done in rearing a
    family of a wife and eight children, if one has the grit and
    determination. Never give up!&rdquo; The latter, I&rsquo;d say, is
    the predominant legacy I have derived from both of my parents and,
    apparently, their immediate ancestors. I only wish I might have
    personally known some of my mother&rsquo;s family. Surely I would
    have understood her better. But, perhaps if her family had so
    endured, then she would never have so needed understanding!</p>

      II. AWARENESS</h2>
  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western">One is never entirely without the
    instinct for looking around.<span style="font-style: normal">
	&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: normal">W.&nbsp;Whitman</span></p>
  <p class="western">I doubt if anyone who reads this will know that
    Nicholas Copernicus, the Polish founder of modern astronomy, died on
    March 24, 1543. I do, because I was born in Washington, D.C.,
    exactly 375 years later. Financier Andrew Mellon, the late movie
    actor Steve McQueen, and former Governor of New York and two-time
    presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey are among others who were
    likewise born on 24 March. To the rising chorus of &ldquo;Who
    cares?&rdquo; I can only say that I apparently do. I include this
    minutiae here precisely because it is so typical of the way my
    strange mind works. I&rsquo;ve always had a weird interest in my
    birthday, especially as regards happenings on that date. Thus, on 24
    March 1818 Henry Clay said, &ldquo;All religions united with the
    government are more or less inimical to liberty. All separated from
    government, are compatible with liberty.&rdquo; And on 24 March
    1900, ground was broken for the first successful New York City
    subway. Perhaps more germane to my family history is that on 24
    March 1882 Robert Koch announced discovery of the tubercle bacillus.
    This has a particular relevance to my life story, since it was this
    little bug that wiped out every last one of my mother&rsquo;s
    relatives. So much, in general, for all you ever wanted to know
    about 24 March but were afraid to ask.</p>
  <p class="western">Now, how about that specific 24 March of 1918, a
    Palm Sunday? That was the day I was born. It was, according to the
    <i>Washington Star</i> of that date, a partly cloudy day, with a
    high of 55 and low of 44. Interestingly enough, the front page
    cartoon depicts Uncle Sam saying to a small boy standing in a
    junk-filled backyard, &ldquo;Son, just see what you could do with
    that old backyard!&rdquo; Uncle Sam was holding up a picture of a
    victory garden (and I got around to taking his advice exactly 60
    years later!) Everything else on the first page of the newspaper
    concerned the war: World War I. One headline proclaimed: &ldquo;Gunfire
    Is Veritable Hell; Explosions Are Continuous.&rdquo; Other headlines
    were: &ldquo;Battle Of Great Intensity Continues, Hague Flashes&rdquo;;
    &ldquo;Children Play Marseillaise As Hun Airmen Bomb Paris&rdquo;;
    &ldquo;Two District Men Interred,&rdquo; (with instructions on &ldquo;How
    To Address Mail For Prisoners In Germany&rdquo;); and so on.</p>
  <p class="western">This was the famous (and last) big German spring
    offensive that smashed through Picardy (which is to the north of
    Paris and gave rise to the song <i>Roses of Picardy</i>). Another
    headline cautioned &ldquo;Fate of Allies Now Depends Upon Number Of
    Positions &ndash; Must Break Weight Of First German Thrust.&rdquo;
    This, then, was the world into which I was born a world in deadly
    turmoil. And the very fact of my birth at that particular time is
    what kept my father at home (being deferred as a multiple father, a
    service my spouse Kathleen likewise rendered for her father) thereby
    saving him from the rain of destruction and possible death in the
    fields of Picardy.</p>
  <p class="western">The main headline, however, which was splashed
    across the full width of the top of the front page of the <i>Star</i>
    in inch-high type on that fateful day, was: &ldquo;<b>GERMANS
      SLAUGHTERED IN ATTACK; SHELLS HURLED 74-1/2 MILES ON PARIS.</b>&rdquo;
    As the twin feature stories elaborated, the Kaiser&rsquo;s forces
    had been pushed back on a 21-mile front to a depth of four to nine
    miles in a tremendous battle near St. Quentin as massed Teuton
    formations were cut to pieces. As for this advent of Big Bertha, the
    paper reported &ldquo;American Army Officers Are Dumbfounded By
    Ordnance Feat.&rdquo; (So, what&rsquo;s new? At the height of WWII,
    FDR&rsquo;s Chief of Staff Admiral William Leahy said of the
    Manhattan Project, &ldquo;The bomb will never go off, and I speak as
    an expert in explosives.&rdquo;) They theorized that perhaps the
    shells were being dropped by enemy planes, and that the rifling
    found on shell fragments (which would testify to their source being
    a gun) was merely a ruse to conceal the true source. Another theory
    was that some natives had turned traitor and had trained their own
    guns around to strike at Paris from much closer in than the
    forwardmost German position. In short, as is so often the case with
    the regimented mind, the military officials among the allies
    couldn&rsquo;t accept the evidence before their eyes because they
    hadn&rsquo;t invented it first. As for me, I think it only fitting
    that my birth into the world should be saluted by the largest gun
    ever known to civilization. And, with the advent of missiles, it is
    likely to remain the largest ever built.</p>
  <p class="western">So, let me tell you a little about this unique
    weapon, with the aid of S. L. A. Marshall&rsquo;s excellent history,
    <i>World War I</i>. The gun (or guns, as it turned out to be a
    battery of three) first opened up on Paris from 75 miles out at 0720
    on 23 March 1918, the news reaching America in time for the morning
    newspapers of the next day. They were the German Navy&rsquo;s newest
    15-inch, 45-caliber gun (that is, more than 56 feet long), with the
    tube rifled down to 8.26 inches, to impart a high spin rate around
    its longitudinal axis, thereby preventing tumbling and providing
    greater accuracy as well as range through the resulting gyroscopic
    action. The shells stood about waist high, but the powder bags which
    impelled them were twice as tall as a man. For firing, the piece was
    invariably pointed at an elevation of 50 degrees, with necessary
    range adjustments accomplished through increasing/decreasing the
    number of powder charges. The projectiles left the muzzle with a
    velocity of one mile per second, traveling 12 miles up into air so
    rare that it would perform according to the law first described by
    Galileo for maximum range in a vacuum &ndash; thereby serving as a
    sort of forerunner of the civilian-scaring V-2 rockets used against
    London in World War II.</p>
  <p class="western">The bombardment continued for a week, culminating
    in the tragedy of Good Friday, 29 March. The Church of St. Gervais,
    opposite the Hotel de Ville, was crowded with kneeling worshipers
    when at 1630 a projectile struck the roof. A stone pillar crumbled,
    and the stone vault that it supported cracked wide apart, dropping
    tons of rock on the congregation &hellip; (leaving) eighty-eight
    dead on the floor and sixty-eight desperately injured. But things
    weren&rsquo;t going all that well with the huge guns; one having
    blown up killing five crewmen. Also, French railway artillery only
    seven miles from the front had homed-in on the Big Bertha site with
    15-inch shells. Finally, the two remaining guns were soon worn out
    and had to be replaced, so that only intermittent firing continued
    to 1 May, when the guns were phased out altogether. Over this period
    the battery had fired some 200 rounds. It was not a significant
    factor in the war, and was more a technical advancement than a
    military success. The fear it engendered did impact civilian morale,
    however, and this continued to be a matter of some moment.</p>
  <p class="western">But all the foregoing was transpiring overseas,
    far, far away from me, and I was totally oblivious to it all and to
    virtually everything else. I suppose everyone at some point in their
    life tries mightily to recall and fix in time their very first
    recollection of <i>awareness</i>. As near as I can tell, my first
    memories derive from when I was about four years old. We lived on
    Oak St. N.W., just off 16th Street, in a row house. I remember that
    a family named Briggs lived next door on the right, and they had a
    boy perhaps a little bit older than I. His name was Leon, and I was
    not allowed to play with him, but I have no idea why. I vividly
    recall sneaking with him into his basement one day to see his toys.
    I was frightened to death that I would be caught and punished, but I
    wasn&rsquo;t. I certainly knew I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be there,
    and so I was not only excited but fearful. On our left lived a
    family named Allen, and they had a much older daughter, Nina,
    possibly in her teens, who was stage-struck and who went on to
    become a singer/dancer in a traveling show group that featured
    Victor Herbert operettas such as Naughty Marietta, and Kiss Me
    Again. I remember her as being very pretty, with long curly hair,
    dark eyes with long lashes, and beautiful flashing white teeth.</p>

    Chocolate, Pop-like goatee</h3>
  <p class="western">I recall I used to sit on a high stool on the
    back porch and operate a lever on the kitchen window shutter like it
    was the electrical controller I had apparently seen on the nearby
    14th Street streetcars. I could play all day as a streetcar motorman
    and conductor, simulating the sound with a humming &ldquo;nun-nun,
    nun-nun, nun-nun&rdquo; (when the operating lever was in the &ldquo;run&rdquo;
    position, of course). I also emulated the &ldquo;p-shish&rdquo; of
    the air brake when the lever was in the stop position, and had a
    foot-operated &ldquo;ding-ding&rdquo; alarm to signal stop and go
    and to clear the track ahead. I was your complete motorman, and I
    never had an accident, but I finally had to give it up. This was
    when I saw Mrs. Allen and my mother laughing at me from the other
    side of the kitchen window one day. That, for me, ruined the whole
    deal. I never felt comfortable again as a streetcar operator. It is
    probably just as well, because years later street-cars were phased
    out and I would have been out of a job. (This sort of reminds me of
    how, in 1945, when all sailors were being released from the Navy,
    dozens of them would insist on working the last month in the
    barbershop aboard ship &ldquo;We can always get a job cutting hair,&rdquo;
    they&rsquo;d explain. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll always be a demand for
    barbers, just like undertakers.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve often wondered
    since whatever happened to the poor slobs who had the misfortune of
    being discharged during the long-hair craze of the 1960s.)</p>

    Sailor and Horseman</h3>
  <p class="western">Another example of my earliest awareness is that
    I recall sitting on the cedar chest at the front upstairs window one
    afternoon while my mother was feeding Poor Tom as she rocked in a
    chair behind me. Suddenly I spied my sister returning from school,
    walking with our cousin Eliot, who lived just two blocks further
    east on Oak St., across 14th St.. The trouble was, she was using a
    prohibited route that took her past a small delicatessen-type store
    on Center St., which angled into Oak St. from the south just a
    little bit east of our house. I remember the store as &ldquo;Dwarn&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
    which may be nothing like its real name. For some reason unknown to
    me, she was not allowed to go near Dwarn&rsquo;s. So, I did it, I
    squealed on her, and with much delight as I recall. &ldquo;There
    goes Margaret with El,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s
    going right by Dwarn&rsquo;s!&rdquo; This is the only time I can
    recall that I was the victor in such a situation. It was always, it
    seemed to me, the other way around. Who says revenge isn&rsquo;t
    sweet? I didn&rsquo;t go unpunished, however, although the two
    events are probably totally unrelated. I downed some canned peaches
    one night for dessert, and with unremitting vigor they came right
    back up. I didn&rsquo;t eat canned peaches again until after I was
    married many years later. Divine revenge? &ldquo;How inscrutable His
    judgments, how unsearchable His ways.&rdquo; &ndash; Ro 11:33.</p>

    Already braced-up for USNA</h3>
  <p class="western">I have only one recollection of my father in this
    early period when I was less than five years old. One morning he
    tied a cardboard box atop of a sled, put me and sister Margaret in
    it, and started pulling us through a big snow up 16th St. toward
    Park Rd., which was four blocks to the south. I remember he stopped
    there, in front of Sacred Heart Church, to talk to friends there.
    And he talked and he talked. What had started as a delightful
    surprise ride through the snow turned into a freezing disaster. We
    just sat there, getting more and more impatient to get going again.
    I don&rsquo;t even remember starting up again. I don&rsquo;t know if
    I blacked out with rage because someone had usurped this rare favor
    from Pop, or if we fainted from the cold.</p>
  <p class="western">This could have been in late January 1922, as the
    great <i>Knickerbocker</i> disaster occurred 28 January 1922, when I
    was almost four. This was the collapse of a theater roof on a full
    audience due to excessively heavy snow. Ninety-eight people died
    (and about 100 more were injured). and almost all were neighbors,
    since the <i>Knickerbocker</i> (the forerunner of the <i>Ambassador</i>)
    stood nearby at the corner of 17th St. and Columbia Road. As of the
    1949 issuance of the Weather Bureau&rsquo;s <i>Climatic Handbook for
      Washington D.C.</i>, this was &ldquo;the greatest snowstorm in the
    75-year meteorological history of Washington,&rdquo; and occurred
    over the period of 27&ndash;29 January 1922, just two months short
    of my fourth birthday. There were nine inches of snow on the ground
    at the end of the first day, and 28 inches at the end of the second
    day, with all streetcar service throughout the District having been
    abandoned by 7:00 PM that night. Final measurements in nearby areas
    ran as high as 36 inches. I&rsquo;ve always hated snow, especially
    since having to pay for auto accidents, but maybe this all started
    then, that &ldquo;Sad Day at Sacred Heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">The foregoing
    comprises the sum total of my recollections of first awareness. But
    there is a lot more I know about myself in those days, thanks
    largely to stories told to me by my mother (when I was already sixty
    and she was going on ninety, and her mind was naturally not quite as
    sharp as it once had been). The biggest thing to occur in my very
    young life was my very near death. This all happened on my second
    birthday, and naturally I have no personal recollection of it.
    Mother has told the story many times, and though precise numbers
    sometimes vary, the substance always comes out about the same. It
    all began around three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of 24 March
    1920. Suddenly, I went into convulsions without any warning. My
    <i>Merck Manual</i> defines convulsions as violent involuntary
    contractions or repeated contractions (a series of spasms) of the
    voluntary muscles. In any event, my mother was alone with me, except
    for my sister Margaret (who at age five was not much help). Though
    she could no longer lift me, as I was huge for my age, she somehow
    got me to the bathroom and submerged all but my face in very warm
    water. This stemmed the convulsion, but left me unconscious. She
    then called our family doctor, Dr. Cogswell, who said he&rsquo;d be
    right over, but that it sounded very bad. She then called Pop, who
    immediately headed for home. During the next 24 hours I had four
    more convulsions, but now Pop was able to trundle me into the tub to
    arrest them. The doctor told Mom that she had done precisely the
    right thing, and that her correct and fast action had probably saved
    my life. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to
    deceive you. This [I still remained unconscious] is very, very bad.
    In all likelihood he is going to die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">The spasms came so suddenly and unexpectedly that
    they finally stopped even trying to clothe me, and merely re-wrapped
    me in a blanket after each attack. No one could come up with any
    explanation for it at all, no hint of a possible cause. I couldn&rsquo;t
    be left alone for a minute. Mom and Pop took turns in being
    constantly at my side, night and day. They both spent their time on
    watch massaging my arms and legs to maintain circulation and soothe
    the violently reacting muscles. They not only got very little sleep,
    Mom recalls that some days they themselves even forgot to eat.
    Grandma Wright had at once taken Margaret to her home (at 14th St..
    and Columbia Rd.) to help out, and Grandpa Wright was apt to drop in
    any time of the day or night. Mom recalls that he&rsquo;d come in,
    go up to my bedroom, look me over for a minute and say, &ldquo;Well,
    he doesn&rsquo;t seem any worse, that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; Then he&rsquo;d
    leave. The doctor, too, would drop in anytime he was in the
    neighborhood, which was several times in the course of each 24
    hours. Yes, Virginia, they made house calls in those days. (And if
    you understand that last line, then you&rsquo;re over 40 years old
    at least.)</p>
  <p class="western">The convulsions ceased after the fifth one, but I
    still didn&rsquo;t regain consciousness. The doctors had given up on
    me, saying there was nothing they could do, and that death was only
    a question of time. At that point a huge swelling developed in the
    left side of my throat. An eye-ear-nose-throat specialist was called
    in &ndash; the best in the city &ndash; a Dr. Warner. He took one
    look at me and announced that he&rsquo;d have to operate then and
    there. Sheets were spread on a small desk-sized table (which I later
    used on Dallas Ave. as a workbench), and with Mom in attendance, he
    proceeded to lance my throat. Mom says that several cups of
    poisonous pus poured out. My sister embellishes this with her
    recollection that three doctors were in attendance for the
    operation: Dr. Warner, Dr. Cogswell, and a Dr. Holden, who turns out
    to be the father of the Dr. Raymond Holden who delivered every one
    of our children from Charlie through Herbie. Also my sister says
    there were three such operations over three succeeding days, and
    that every time she saw the three doctors come into the house, she
    immediately took off for the farthest corner of the backyard,
    because she couldn&rsquo;t stand the screaming (while unconscious?)
    that always attended their presence.</p>
  <p class="western">Several weeks later (and Mom recalls that I was
    unconscious for between three and four weeks, and nearer to the
    latter), I suddenly woke up for the first time since it all began.
    Mom was rocking close by, and her first hint that I&rsquo;d finally
    snapped out of it was when she heard me say, &ldquo;I want an egg!&rdquo;
    (How is that, Mary, for a testimonial for the <i>United Egg
      Producers</i>?) Anyhow, these operations left a rough two-inch scar
    on my left neck, just under the jaw hinge (Yes! I ultimately
    survived!), but it blends right into the creases of my neck so that
    it is rarely visible. Sometimes, whether due to my metabolism or the
    weather, I do not know, it becomes quite visible through assuming a
    different skin color than the surrounding area. But usually, no one
    even notices it. (As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;d been undergoing
    so-called thorough physical examinations annually in the Navy for a
    half-dozen years before it was discovered and added to my health
    record charts as a &ldquo;distinguishing mark.&rdquo; It was
    discovered by an &ldquo;old pro&rdquo; doctor from Massachusetts
    General in Boston, who had been converted into a Lieutenant (junior
    grade) by the war. He asked me about it, and I started to tell all.
    He yelled, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough! The less anyone knows about
    that the better. You don&rsquo;t want all that in your service
    record.&rdquo; And then he wrote under &ldquo;cause&rdquo; the two
    words &ldquo;childhood accident,&rdquo; for reasons that will soon
    become clear.</p>
  <p class="western">Mom couldn&rsquo;t believe her ears when she
    suddenly heard my voice for the first time in almost a month. But
    she gave me the egg since, she says, they had been unable to get
    anything into me over the past several weeks except for a little
    carefully administered liquids. This was before intravenous feeding,
    folks, and Mom says that at this point I looked like one of those
    starving kids they show on TV who are victims of the drought in
    Africa. In fact, all agreed that I had survived so long with so
    little sustenance precisely because I had been such a big and
    healthy specimen at the start. (The same claim was made regarding my
    son George after his near fatal flying accident in 1968. He had been
    working out daily, doing calisthenics and lots of running. The
    doctors said he would never had made it if he hadn&rsquo;t started
    off in such superior condition. The also gave an assist to his
    parachute training at Fort Benning, suggesting that his reflexes had
    been pre-conditioned on how best to hit the ground and roll.)
    Anyhow, by the time I finished my egg, the doctor had happened to
    drop in, as he so frequently did (and Mom says his small bill was
    almost embarrassing), and he couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes. I
    asked for another egg, and Mom turned to the doctor to ask it if was
    okay. The doctor happily exclaimed, &ldquo;Anything! Give him
    anything he wants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">So I started to get well, although my sister
    remembers that I kept throwing up a lot, and both she and Mom
    confirm that I had to learn how to walk all over again. It was
    several months later, when things had finally calmed down and were
    almost back to normal, that Mom suddenly remembered something. One
    day, several weeks before my first convulsion, she had found me with
    a purple substance all over my face and inside my mouth. A search
    soon disclosed that I had apparently been sucking one of my father&rsquo;s
    rubber stamp indelible ink pads. Poison! I&rsquo;d found it in one
    of several as yet unpacked boxes of his gear, that remained from our
    February move to Oak St. She immediately swabbed and flushed both
    the outside and inside of my mouth with boric acid solution,
    thoroughly, and all seemed well. But evidently I had ingested quite
    a bit of the ink. All the doctors agreed that this is what
    undoubtedly caused my convulsions and the associated neck gland
    condition.</p>
  <p class="western">Now only one question remained &ndash; how did
    Mom know what to do for convulsions? It turns out that one of her
    investments upon getting married was a family home medical book. She
    figured it was part of her responsibility, as a wife and soon-to-be
    mother, to be prepared to deal with all types of sicknesses and
    health emergencies. So, she had read the whole book cover-to-cover
    several times. She absorbed it. In a word, she was &ldquo;prepared.&rdquo;
    So it was, on another occasion about this time, I fell over backward
    from my rocking chair and split my head open on our iron radiator
    (now you all know I <i>do</i> have a hole in my head). Mom coolly
    shaved off the surrounding hair, flushed it with boric acid,
    effectively sutured it with tape over a sterile pad, and left the
    doctor with nothing to do but add, &ldquo;Perfectly done.&rdquo; Now
    I ask you, children, does that sound familiar? And you thought I had
    invented planning. Not so. I apparently (and unconsciously)
    inherited this propensity from my mother early on, and we&rsquo;ll
    hear more of this later.</p>
  <p class="western">The foregoing discovery, that I had an inherited
    tendency to look ahead and plan for every conceivable possibility,
    was one of many surprises that evolved in the course of developing
    this narrative. I&rsquo;d reflect on a particular trait, and then
    I&rsquo;d conclude that I&rsquo;d gotten it from my engineering
    discipline as it matured in post-graduate school. Then I&rsquo;d
    recall earlier indications of that trait which had occurred prior to
    post-graduate school. So, I&rsquo;d walk it back and attribute it to
    the regimentation and scientific training at USNA. Later, another
    earlier indication would result in my ascribing it to the
    concentrated discipline inculcated at prep school. And so on, and so
    on. Invariably, exploring various traits, I&rsquo;d trace them
    further and further back until there was only one possible source &ndash;
    early home life.</p>
  <p class="western">My experience with live-in granddaughter Laurie
    (from ages one to eight) confirms and reinforces this ultimate
    source of well-ingrained traits: early home life. Every now and then
    I&rsquo;d become frightened and awed with the sudden and inescapable
    realization that I was really deeply involved in molding her plastic
    little mind. Usually this occurred in the course of correcting her
    or encouraging her in some course of action. Then it dawned on me I
    was forming her, bending her &ndash; literally forcing &ldquo;values&rdquo;
    on her. It&rsquo;s a tremendous responsibility. And it&rsquo;s
    frightening. But, as John D. MacDonald remarks in <i>A Deadly Shade
      of Gold</i>, &ldquo;The only thing in the world worth a damn is the
    strange, touching, pathetic, awesome nobility of the individual
    human spirit.&rdquo; You realize what an awesome thing parenthood
    is. As I say, as I progress through this story I&rsquo;m repeatedly
    amazed at the extent of the ingrained value system that was
    apparently formed in me even before I was &ldquo;aware.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">I have no awareness of the house we lived in when
    I was born. It was in an apartment over Parker&rsquo;s Drug Store at
    the northwest corner of Rhode Island Ave. and North Capitol St..
    This was in St. Martin&rsquo;s parish, which is where I was baptized
    on 21 April 1918. My godmother was Loretta Meehan Walker, who died
    in 1979. My late godfather, Arthur Clark, who went with us to the
    hospital the night I was born because he happened to be visiting at
    the time, settled in San Francisco after service in World War I. He
    had been an Army ambulance driver in France and the experience left
    him quite horrified. I finally got to meet him during World War II,
    when Kathleen and I and George shared wartime government housing in
    Richmond, CA, which is just above Oakland at the northernmost end of
    the BART subway system. He came to dinner one night, and amazed us
    by how expertly he shut George up after &ldquo;Clumso&rdquo; had
    fallen off a chair on his head (luckily, and as you all must have
    long suspected). He ignored George, and instead he excitedly got
    down on his hands and knees and pointed to an imaginary dent that
    George&rsquo;s head supposedly had made in the floor. &ldquo;Look!
    Look! Would you look at the dent his head made in the floor!&rdquo;
    Well, in no time at all George was on his hands and knees beside
    him, and had forgotten all about screaming. It was &ldquo;the old
    distraction game,&rdquo; and you better believe we used it many
    times after that. It almost always works, and certainly it pinpoints
    the real injuries.</p>
  <p class="western">But back to St. Martin&rsquo;s. My folks were
    married there, and, as I said, I was baptized there. However, as my
    folks used to say, &ldquo;We only lived there long enough to build
    the new church. Then we moved to Sacred Heart and built their new
    church. Then we moved to St. Anthony&rsquo;s and built their new
    church.&rdquo; They always seemed to get in on the ground floor of
    each new building fund campaign, even as I did many years later at
    St. Bernadette&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s now a family tradition. But one
    interesting sidelight is, though both our families lived in St.
    Anthony&rsquo;s when Kathleen and I were wed, we were actually
    married in St. Martin&rsquo;s due to St. Anthony&rsquo;s being
    semi-closed for remodeling at the time. This affiliation with St.
    Martin&rsquo;s is one of two bases for George&rsquo;s middle name
    Martin. The second reason for the name will come later in this
    story. In any event, this is about all I know of the slightly more
    than first 1-1/2 years of my life on North Capital St., except for a
    few recollections of my sister, Margaret.</p>
  <p class="western">She recalls that she was really upset when they
    brought me home from the hospital, because she had the measles, so
    they wouldn&rsquo;t let her near me. But that&rsquo;s her story. I
    suspect that she was naturally mortally jealous of such a handsome
    male child from the start, and my folks were just trying desperately
    to protect me. Margaret also says that I learned to walk at nine
    months, and just wouldn&rsquo;t stop (I probably was trying to run
    away from her). She also recalls the day when I was slightly over a
    year old and I fell against the hot stove, and the name of the stove
    ended up being scorched into my arm like a cattle brand. (What a
    testimonial I could have done for the stove!) She remembers how neat
    it was to merely call downstairs to have the pharmacist send up the
    proper balm to soothe the pain and shut me up. (So, you see, Mary,
    pharmacists impacted our family life from the very outset.)</p>
  <p class="western">Our next house was the already mentioned one on
    Oak St. We had only been there about two months when I got so
    desperately sick as recounted earlier. That&rsquo;s how it was the
    ink pads hadn&rsquo;t yet been safely stowed away. And, I suppose
    it&rsquo;s just about time to stow away this saga of my first five
    years on this strange planet, except to pose a few tentative
    conclusions. (I say &ldquo;tentative&rdquo; since, for me, at least,
    this is a sort of mystery story, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see how
    it turns out. I&rsquo;m making new discoveries about myself on
    almost every page.) So, here we go. It now seems that before I was
    five I had a well ingrained idea of right and wrong (fearful with
    Leon, uncomfortably jealous of my sister); I could appreciate beauty
    (Nina Allen); I had a sense of dignity or a thin skin or both (I
    didn&rsquo;t like being laughed at); I respected authority (Leon
    again, and the prohibition about Dwarn&rsquo;s which didn&rsquo;t
    yet even apply to me); and I either hated snow or being ignored or
    both (I think both); and had benefited several times from a thorough
    pre-planning habit that must have been being concurrently deeply
    implanted in my subconscious. At the same time, I seemed to be
    either reckless or overly adventuresome, and was somewhat
    anti-authoritarian. I obviously didn&rsquo;t relish being ignored,
    much less suppressed.</p>
  <p class="western">Charles Lindbergh, in some life recollections,
    confesses to what he contends are the three prime concerns at first
    awareness: food, toys, and need for attention. I remember very
    little indeed about food or toys at this period of my life, but I
    certainly can confirm his belief about seeking attention &ndash; as
    any mother of any crying child might have suspected. This need for
    attention was no doubt heightened by what I must confess even now
    appears to have been my predominant perception upon arriving at
    first awareness (and is something from which you younger parents may
    profit by remembering) &ndash; an intense feeling of inferiority
    with respect to the seeming parental favor enjoyed by my brother and
    sister. On the other hand, I rather imagine that few would-be
    authors could boast of having writer&rsquo;s ink in their very blood
    before the age of two!</p>

      III. FRUSTRATION</h2>
  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western">I&rsquo;m nobody! Who are you? Are
    you nobody, too? Then there&rsquo;s a pair of us &ndash; don&rsquo;t
    tell! They&rsquo;d banish us, you know.<span style="font-style: normal">
	&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Emily&nbsp;Dickinson</span></p>
  <p class="western">There&rsquo;s a story about a guy who was born in
    Pittsburgh but who (due to the overhanging mushroom cloud of steel
    mill smoke) &ldquo;first saw the light of day&rdquo; when the family
    moved to Peoria six years later. So it was with me. I was born in an
    apartment on North Capitol Street, and lived through age five on Oak
    Street (just off Sixteenth), but I first really grasped the
    realities of the world and the passage of time when we moved to 1105
    Shepherd Street, in northeast Washington in May of 1923. This is
    when my life actually began as a fully sentient being, and when I
    first ventured beyond the home alone and confronted the totality of
    my earthly environment.</p>
  <p class="western">The next six-year segment of my life, which
    extended from age five until about June 1929 when I was 11,
    represents perhaps the biggest period of growth in my entire life. I
    don&rsquo;t mean physical growth, or even mental or intellectual
    growth, but more like psychological-philosophical growth. This was
    when I was really impacted by my relationships with people, in and
    out of the home, and when I figuratively tasted the world. I
    virtually held a moistened finger aloft in the wind, testing its
    direction, and then set about laying my course for life. What
    follows are facts. Before age eleven, I (1) determined upon leaving
    home at the earliest practicable opportunity, (2) chose marriage as
    my vocational state, and (3) decided that I wanted the biggest
    family with which the Lord might choose to bless me, and should
    therefore seek as a wife one of like mind! These were calculated and
    conclusive decisions. I never thereafter flinched from this course,
    never had any doubts, never had any worries. This was it &ndash; the
    way it was going to be. And, you&rsquo;d better believe I was
    subjected to some tremendous pressure along the way to opt for a
    religious vocation, but I&rsquo;d only shake my head negatively,
    smiling inwardly at my serene secret &ndash; that I was already
    firmly set upon the proper course.</p>
  <p class="western">The move from the Oak to the Shepherd Street of
    those days was a real move, equivalent in these times to a move from
    the inner city to the outlying suburbs. It was also a move from
    northwest to northeast Washington, which any District-liner will
    recognize as a move &ldquo;across the tracks&rdquo; (the Baltimore
    and Ohio Railroad, actually), from the area of the &ldquo;automatic
    elite&rdquo; to the area of the &ldquo;struggling masses.&rdquo; In
    those days, real city folks lived in the city, and only the less
    fortunate had to settle for the suburbs. It made no difference that
    my father had a very legitimate reason for the move &ndash; to be
    closer to work. Anybody who wanted to be somebody opted for the
    northwest or, better said, &ldquo;west of Rock Creek Park.&rdquo;
    That was the real dividing line.</p>

    Class Picture</h3>
  <p class="western">Now, all this meant nothing to me, and probably
    even less to my father, but it was a matter of critical importance
    to my mother &ndash; not that it always revealed itself in these
    terms, but she was for a fact extremely status conscious. And the
    suburbs of those days were really &ldquo;country,&rdquo; not &ldquo;city.&rdquo;
    We lived a few blocks beyond the end of the street-car line, and
    there were very few houses beyond us, and all very well spaced. Our
    street was the last one lined with houses side-by-side on both sides
    of the street. And beyond our backyard was a genuine and active
    dairy farm, complete with cows and their casual by-product. (&ldquo;Look
    out, son, that ain&rsquo;t second base!&rdquo;) And there were
    streams galore. After all, this was &ldquo;Brookland.&rdquo; So I
    literally grew up to the night-time tunes of railroad whistles,
    mooing cows, neighing horses, croaking frogs, and sighing crickets.</p>

    With <i>Bwana</i></h3>
  <p class="western">The neighborhood was interesting, too. Or perhaps
    I should say, neighborhoods, for there were two of them. They were
    bounded approximately by 10th street on the west, 14th street on the
    east, Kearney street on the south, and Varum street (then Bates
    road) on the north &ndash; barely a third of a mile square. Yet it
    was a divided neighborhood, split into two unequal sections by
    Michigan Avenue. Our church and school, St. Anthony&rsquo;s, were in
    the larger southern portion that was truly Brookland, and we were in
    the smaller northern section called Michigan Park. These weren&rsquo;t
    just contiguous neighborhoods of like character and only nebulously
    divided. These were aggressively competitive neighborhoods, bitter
    rivals sometimes, but rivals all the time. There was an
    us-against-them situation always. Both areas had fierce pride, even
    if, thanks to the common church, it was generally good-natured.</p>
  <p class="western">Brookland was what I&rsquo;d now term an ethnic
    neighborhood, comprising Italians, Poles, Germans, and an abundance
    of Irish. Michigan Park was what I&rsquo;d now classify as your
    archetypical WASP village with a light sprinkling of English
    Catholics. In Brookland one would meet the Fachini brothers (who
    later won GI fame in Italy, &ldquo;they could speak the language,
    you know&rdquo;); the Costellos and Flanagans (real ballplayers);
    the McGuinesses (really tough, our very own <i>Dead End Kids</i>
    gang); and the Restofos (who always had the latest model huge black
    limousine, and were reputed to be the neighborhood bootleggers). In
    Michigan Park one would meet the relatively colorless Breens, Olds,
    Wrights, Mannings, Conways, Hudnutts, Noyes, Graysons, Thompsons,
    Popes and Paines. Both neighborhoods had a distinctive flavor, and a
    Michigan-Parker kid knew he was in alien territory whenever he
    headed south across Michigan Avenue.</p>
  <p class="western">But it was a great place to grow up. It had a
    sort of college campus atmosphere, with the streets being flooded
    each fall by an influx of new Catholic University (CU) freshmen in
    their little green beanies. Who will ever forget such football
    greats as Whitey Ambrose, Bus Sherry, Joe Champa, Jack Malovich, Tom
    Oliver, and Tommy Whealan (who later starred with the Pittsburgh
    Steelers)? You say you don&rsquo;t remember them? Then you never
    shared the excitement of the Brookland of my youth. And it must have
    been like a little Vatican City. We were situated almost at the
    center of a quadrangle comprising CU, St. Anthony&rsquo;s, the
    Franciscan Monastery, and the Sisters&rsquo; College. Almost two out
    of every three people encountered on the streets were likely to be
    wearing either a Roman collar or a nun&rsquo;s habit. (One day after
    school, a few years later, I got into a fist fight with one of my
    classmates, but in my own neighborhood, nowhere near the school. The
    next day our teacher had punished us both. It seems she had seen us
    while walking from St. Anthony&rsquo;s to Sisters&rsquo; College for
    her late afternoon class. Man, like I mean those priests and nuns
    were everywhere!) It was a uniquely religious &ndash; Catholic &ndash;
    community. And every fall you could hear the cheering throng that
    filled the football stadium at CU.</p>
  <p class="western">The Fourth of July was really special. There was
    an all-day festival held in Hutchinson&rsquo;s Field, complete with
    a dozen makeshift stands for hot dogs, cakes, cold drinks, and
    assorted games of chance and skill. The morning featured all sorts
    of track and field events for all ages and sexes (in those days
    there were only two of the latter). I especially remember the family
    excitement the day my father won a potato race for married men. I
    was the annual gold medal winner for the 100-yard-dash for boys in
    my age group (and remember how everybody but the then youngest girl
    won their foot-race at a <i>K of C</i> picnic one Fourth of July in
    the 1960s!) The afternoon featured an always hotly contested
    baseball game between the <i>Kid Kellys</i> from Brookland, and the
    <i>Rex A.C.</i> from Michigan Park. One summer the ragtag-outfitted
    <i>Rex A.C.</i> suddenly became the fully uniformed <i>Crandalls</i>,
    thanks to the sponsorship of the Crandall movie house chain, which
    included the then brand-new <i>Tivoli</i> at 14th and Park Road. One
    of the guys had merely written Mr. Crandall a letter, and this was
    the result! I have never forgotten this example of the power of a
    well-written letter, and the philosophy of &ldquo;nothing ventured:
    nothing gained.&rdquo; Incidentally, the team didn&rsquo;t play any
    better baseball.</p>
  <p class="western">As a matter of my best recollection, our team
    never won, under either name, but I remember my one brief moment of
    glory. Normally, I couldn&rsquo;t qualify for the baseball team for
    the simple reason that I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to go into
    Hutchinson&rsquo;s Field where each team had its own diamond. But my
    second in the sun occurred on a Fourth of July; the one day in the
    year that every resident kid got to play. It began when I executed a
    smart double-play as second baseman. I dashed to my left and speared
    a hot grounder, tagged a passing base-runner headed for second base,
    and threw out the batter at first. I then followed this up at my
    next time at bat by lashing a long drive over the left fielder&rsquo;s
    head for a triple, driving in the then go-ahead run. I fondly
    remember overhearing Charlie Smith&rsquo;s Brooklander father
    telling my Pop that I should be playing for the <i>Kid Kellys</i>.
    Anyhow the day finally ended with the community fireworks display
    and the annual attack by the mosquitoes from the nearby streams.</p>
  <p class="western">Yet, the thing I remember most about the area to
    this day is the smell the smell of the trees and shrubs, of the
    fresh broken ground in the garden in the spring, of the first-cut
    grass, and of the changing of the seasons. Our home in Silver Spring
    over the past 30 years is scarcely six miles north of what I
    consider my real birthplace in Brookland-Michigan Park, but the
    smells aren&rsquo;t the same, and I&rsquo;ve never really felt at
    home, but more like a visitor. This came back to me with a bang at
    age 55 when I returned to Brookland to work for Father Burke. I
    remember fondly sniffing the air each morning as I strolled from my
    car into the Dominican House, and I&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Hey! This is
    it! It hasn&rsquo;t changed.&rdquo; And, honestly, sometimes I could
    almost hear the cheers of the crowd swelling up from the vicinity of
    the now empty and rapidly deteriorating football stadium. There is
    something unique about one&rsquo;s birthplace, at least to me. It&rsquo;s
    like no place else on earth, and I&rsquo;ve been more places than
    most.</p>
  <p class="western">I got off to a really bad start in Brookland,
    though. The day after we moved in, my sister came down with Scarlet
    Fever. In one of those perversities we so often witness in life (as
    when Maureen smashed her teeth while on a volunteer mission of mercy
    to the old folks at University Nursing Home), tragedy struck the
    most benign of scenes &ndash; a First Communion class, wherein my
    sister was one of five girls to come down with the fever. Scarlet
    Fever was a real zinger in those days &ndash; the whole house and
    family were quarantined for 30 days. I wasn&rsquo;t allowed out of
    the backyard. Our new neighbor, Mrs. Noyes (later Mrs. MacKavanaugh)
    bought me several kites, all of which I immediately destroyed by
    catching them in the one small tree in the yard. This came to mind
    as recently as the 1979 Memorial Day family party at Kinross.
    George, Charlie and I took all the on-the-scene grandchildren down
    to Sligo Park. After everyone else had successfully flown the kite,
    my turn came, and I promptly caught it in the one small pine in the
    immediate vicinity. So it goes&hellip; Anyhow, here I was set down
    in a safe country scene with a brand new bunch of playmates, and I
    wasn&rsquo;t allowed out of the yard. Margaret was completely sealed
    off in her room. Mom was further burdened at the time with my
    eight-month-old brother, Tom, and Pop, who was allowed leave for
    work, was restricted to eating and sleeping in the living room.</p>
  <p class="western">A <i>Bon Secours</i> nun was brought in to nurse
    Margaret. They are an order of nuns who assist the sick in their own
    houses. She didn&rsquo;t help me. I remember vividly how one day,
    after I had talked back to my mother, this sweet little Hessian
    chased me into the bathroom where I tried to wedge myself, not
    completely successfully, under the bathtub. As I cringed there she
    flailed away at me with what Columbo would call &ldquo;an
    unidentified blunt instrument.&rdquo; I would still classify this as
    the most humiliating experience of my entire life. (The only close
    competitor is the day my Aunt Alma took me and her son Eliot to Glen
    Echo on the streetcar for the day. They evidently had camel-like
    bladders, as they never went to the toilet the entire day. I did,
    however, in my pants on the way home in the streetcar. Fortunately,
    the ride was so long and the day was so hot that I completely dried
    out before we disembarked.) Anyhow, I remember seeing my mother
    hovering over the sister&rsquo;s shoulder, and since she didn&rsquo;t
    seem to be trying to restrain the nun, I assumed my mother was
    cheering her on. This had a devastating effect on my relationship
    with my mother at the time, although I&rsquo;d long since forgotten
    it. It was only when I began reminiscing in preparation for this
    narrative that my sister told me, &ldquo;You know, that made mother
    furious. She thought the nun had overstepped her bounds.&rdquo; No,
    I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

    May procession</h3>
  <p class="western">This bout with severe illness bought my sister an
    even more favored position in the family pecking order. This was
    over and above that accruing to her being the eldest child, the only
    girl in the family, and the only granddaughter in the entire tribe.
    Then there was brother Tom, with his inalienable permanent claim of
    being the perpetual baby in the family, who further enhanced this
    position of familial advantage by his aforementioned year-long bout
    with rheumatic fever. (I still can&rsquo;t figure out why my
    accident didn&rsquo;t endear me more. Perhaps it was precisely
    because it was an accident, and one of my own making.) Now, however
    eyebrow-raising these casual declarations may be to casual readers
    (and certainly no one would read this on purpose), these were very
    real forces for me to reckon with &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t make them
    up, I merely recognized them. I emerged into my awareness of unique
    personhood and independence as an oppressed human being. This
    feeling was considerably heightened by my mother&rsquo;s protective
    inclinations, which my reaction &ndash; a struggle to gain at least
    parity with my siblings &ndash; undoubtedly brought into focus on me
    in particular.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">Every day the
    Brooklanders played football and baseball in season on the other
    side of my backyard fence &ndash; Hutchinson&rsquo;s Field (now
    <i>Turkey Thicket Playground</i>). But, as I&rsquo;ve indicated, I
    wasn&rsquo;t allowed to go into Hutchinson&rsquo;s Field except for
    the community Fourth of July celebrations. Instead, we were the only
    family in the area to play croquet on the front lawn &ndash; to the
    constant jibes of the Brooklander bringing the evening newspaper,
    who derided it as &ldquo;a ladies&rsquo; game.&rdquo; Whenever it
    rained during the summertime, all the neighborhood kids were out in
    their drawers playing in the rain. Not me &ndash; I &ldquo;might
    catch cold.&rdquo; (I was once driven, without permission, to take
    over a Saturday Evening Post route &ndash; I was perhaps nine &ndash;
    just to have a chance to walk in the rain! I was too young for this,
    and I really butchered the collection records.) Every summer, as
    soon as school was out, every boy in Washington got a crew haircut.
    Not me. &ldquo;How would it look for a Professor&rsquo;s son to have
    a crew cut?&rdquo; How could any youngster cope with such deadly
    logic as that? Every summer the Brooklanders dammed up two
    converging streams in Hutchinson&rsquo;s Field and built the most
    magnificent old swimming hole that anyone could imagine &ndash;
    complete with high diving board and recirculating drains and
    overflows. It was off-limits to me. Man! I tell you, rightly or
    wrongly, I grew up feeling totally oppressed and fully frustrated.</p>
  <p class="western">Meanwhile, Pop was a free spirit. Unlike Mom and
    her concern for how I&rsquo;d look doing this or wearing that, Pop
    didn&rsquo;t give a damn what anybody thought about anything that he
    did. He often, to me, seemed to go out of his way to appear
    unconventional, and I took a lot of heat for that, too, from the
    very present and always jeering Brooklanders. For one thing, he was
    the only man I ever knew or ever saw, aside from newspapers or
    movies, who actually wore spats. The Brooklanders used to yell,
    &ldquo;Hey, Doc, your socks are falling down over your shoes!&rdquo;
    It never bothered him, but it sure bothered me. They were always
    boxing me into a position where I felt compelled to defend him to
    them. Then he went to Europe in 1926. You guessed it. He came back
    complete with walking cane, and alternately bedecked in either derby
    or beret. This gave rise to a Brooklander chorus of assorted hoots
    like, &ldquo;Hey, Doc! There&rsquo;s something on your head,&rdquo;
    or &ldquo;Hey, Doc! Where&rsquo;s the snake?&rdquo; To make matters
    worse, he brought me a fancy leather book bag from Holland, complete
    with dainty lace-like tassels. Rather than hurt his feelings, I&rsquo;d
    carry the damn thing to school and really undergo a barrage of hoots
    and jeers.</p>
  <p class="western">And later on in life, when other men were
    satisfied with full beards or smartly trimmed mustaches, he had to
    have the only goatee in town. He always had to be different &ndash;
    even when it came, at last, to buying the first family car. This
    great event occurred somewhere in this period I&rsquo;d guess about
    1926. But there was to be no conventional car for us. No sir! He
    proudly arrived home one evening in &ndash; a Franklin<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote4anc" href="#sdendnote4sym"><sup>4</sup></a>,
    the only air-cooled car on the market, the Corvair of its day.</p>

  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">That would have
    been fine except that the conventional car had a fancy nickel-plated
    radiator complete with hood ornament. In lieu of this, the Franklin
    had a funny looking scoop-like snout more reminiscent of the first
    horseless-carriages. This evoked a Brookland chorus of &ldquo;Hey,
    Doc! You forgot your horse.&rdquo; I ought to mention that this
    continuing fusillade of verbal barbs never ruffled Pop, in fact, I
    have a residual feeling that both sides looked on it all as a
    delightful game, and that I was the only non-playing bystander.</p>
  <p class="western">The advent of the auto in our family launched the
    first instance that I can recall of my demonstrated assimilation of
    my mother&rsquo;s facility for planning. On summer evenings we used
    to venture a mile or two &ldquo;into the country&rdquo; to cool off
    before bedtime. I began to secrete my small flashlight in my pocket
    as protection against the disaster of a flat tire in the unlighted
    countryside. When and if catastrophe struck, and as Pop fumbled in
    the dark, I fantasized how I&rsquo;d suddenly produce my little
    light and exclaim, &ldquo;Here, I brought this along in the event of
    just such an emergency.&rdquo; I was prepared. Everybody would be
    properly amazed and suitably grateful. I would bask in the glory of
    it all. &ldquo;Oh, it was nothing. I just believe in being
    prepared.&rdquo; Unfortunately, this proud moment never came.</p>
  <p class="western">But this isn&rsquo;t the only way that the auto
    figured in my early life. It was also the device that served to
    alert me to the passage of time and more especially to its cyclical
    nature. It was in 1924 that I first observed our neighbor, Mr.
    Gillis, changing the license plate on his car on New Year&rsquo;s
    Day. Thus I vividly remember 1924 as being the first yearly
    designation ever impressed upon my young mind. Thus, it was three
    months before my sixth birthday that my personal &ldquo;march of
    time&rdquo; began. I have no recollection of 1923 as such.
    Subsequently, I was keenly aware of the arrival of 1925 and 1926 as
    signaled by the new license plates. By 1927, apparently this had
    become old hat, and I no longer needed this crutch to inform me of
    the passage of time. This was the period in my life, too, which
    first accented the collapse of time that uniquely marks the
    experience of my generation. Perhaps Toffler sums it up best in his
    <i>Future Shock</i> thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">It has been observed that if the last
    50,000 years of man&rsquo;s existence were divided into lifetimes of
    approximately 62 years each, there have been about 800 such
    lifetimes. Of these 800, fully 650 were spent in caves. Only during
    the last 70 lifetimes did masses of men see a printed word. Only
    during the last four has it been possible to measure time with
    precision. Only in the last two has anyone anywhere used an electric
    motor. And the overwhelming majority of material goods we use in
    daily life today have been developed within the present, the 800th
    lifetime.</p>
  <p class="western">To this Hans King adds a post-script: &ldquo;The
    progress of modern science, technology, industry, communication,
    culture is unparalleled: it surpasses the boldest fantasies of Jules
    Verne and other former futurologists.&rdquo; Gone are the streetcars
    of my youth, and we saw the advent of buses first electric, then
    gasoline, and now diesel.</p>
  <p class="western">Our childhood was still the era of the
    extra-paper. I can recall September 1923 when a late evening
    extra-paper heralded that Jack Dempsey had demolished Luis Firpo in
    a prize fight for the heavy-weight championship of the world. And I
    can remember the dismay of September 1926, when another extra-paper
    brought the unwelcome news that Gene Tunney had dethroned Dempsey.
    The latter had been my very first hero, and woe the poor unfortunate
    who succeeds a legend &ndash; witness the recent distress of poor
    Leon Spinks after dethroning Ali. No one likes to witness the
    passing of a symbol of their own dreams. No one wins lasting acclaim
    by surpassing a superhero.</p>
  <p class="western">My first &ldquo;in-person&rdquo; hero was my
    neighbor, Eliot Noyes. He was the oldest of three mother-dominated
    boys, and he refused to be dominated. The second boy became a
    late-vocation priest, and the youngest, Albert, didn&rsquo;t break
    away to get married until he was in his very late forties. It was
    Eliot who first pointed the way for me that freedom from mother
    could only be achieved by leaving home. First he joined the Navy,
    and worked on airplanes at the old Anacostia Naval Air Station. Then
    he did a brief hitch in the Marine Corps, from which (as was then
    allowed) he purchased his way out. Finally, he upped and married and
    moved to the west coast &ndash; never to return, not even for his
    mother&rsquo;s funeral in May of 1978. In fact, he never so much as
    spoke to his mother after leaving home. I can now see that, like me
    and my mother, they couldn&rsquo;t get along precisely because they
    were so much alike. So, it was a constant dog fight, with neither
    party giving an inch. I do think that I, with time, have made a more
    mature (and Christian) accommodation.</p>
  <p class="western">But, to continue, soon the extra-papers were also
    gone with the winds of change. The NBC radio network was born in
    July of 1926. I remember our first little crystal set, with
    earphones, and the then current joke, &ldquo;You can stick your
    aerial out the window and get Pittsburgh. You can stick your ass out
    the window and get Chile.&rdquo; So it goes&hellip; Lindbergh
    traversed the formidable Atlantic, alone, in a single-engine plane
    in May of 1927, which was probably the month of my unremembered
    First Communion. I well recall the excitement when the Keith Theater
    (where my mother had taken us for a Buster Keaton comedy)
    interrupted the film and lit up the stage for an announcer. &ldquo;Ladies
    and gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Lindbergh has landed safely in
    Paris.&rdquo; The whole world went wild. Yes, extra-papers (perhaps
    the last such) were on the streets when we left the theater moments
    later, but this event unmistakably marked the emergence of a new era
    of history &ndash; the light-fast-communication,
    transportation-shrunken little world of today. And this was the
    point at which I was to begin my formal education. But as you know,
    Eliot Noyes had already elicited the first major decision of my
    life, having convinced me (unbeknownst to him, I&rsquo;m sure) of
    the inevitable necessity of my getting away from home, if ever I was
    to feel free, and as soon as possible.</p>

    First Communion</h3>
  <p class="western">The dismal family atmosphere of the immediately
    ensuing years was only to confirm the urgency of this course of
    action, as I became increasingly aware of the constant nagging of my
    mother. For, indeed, my father was nothing if not passive. It seemed
    to me to almost become a game for him. Mother seemed determined to
    make Pop mad. It seemed to infuriate her that she never succeeded.
    For Pop&rsquo;s objective seemed to be to hold his temper. His was
    the most dramatic demonstration of forbearance and patience that
    I&rsquo;ve ever witnessed. (I know, girls, too bad none of this
    quality of his rubbed off on me.) Anyway, the more intemperate my
    mother would become (and she could be truly creative in this
    respect), the more accommodating my father would become. It was
    incredible.</p>
  <p class="western">I got so I hated seeing them together, and I
    strove mightily to avoid being confined with them, as in the car,
    where they were remindful of the old-time gladiators whose left
    hands were bound together while they thrashed each other at close
    range with their free right hands. Now, you might have expected that
    this would sour me on any idea of marriage and drive me into a
    monastery. Quite the contrary (and incidentally, I&rsquo;ve been
    inside a few monasteries in recent years, and you wouldn&rsquo;t
    believe the pettiness and total lack of charity I encountered there.
    People remain flawed by Original Sin wherever they choose to
    operate). In any event, I was soon to find the idea of marriage, and
    the largest possible family, a &ldquo;Sterling&rdquo; idea. Stay
    tuned.</p>

      IV. SCHOOL</h2>
  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western">I have never let my schooling
    interfere with my education.<span style="font-style: normal">
	&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: normal">Mark&nbsp;Twain</span></p>
  <p class="western">This next period of my life began with my
    starting to school in February of 1924, one month short of my sixth
    birthday. The first thing I must say about this opening segment of
    my formal schooling is that I learned more out of school than I did
    in it. As a matter of fact, I haven&rsquo;t one single recollected
    example of something I learned in school during this period, except,
    of course, that I must have learned the mechanics of reading and
    writing. As a would-be theologian (which is something akin to a
    self-taught brain surgeon), it may or may not be of some
    significance that my very first teacher was a Dominican nun named
    Sister <i>Thomas Aquinas</i>. But, in any event, it is clear to me
    that the more important facet of my development during this period
    occurred in the realm of the broadened socialization associated with
    going to school. Of course, the home still remained the center of my
    training, with the neighborhood influences running a close second.
    Two examples may suffice.</p>
  <p class="western">&ldquo;Pop,&rdquo; I whined one night, &ldquo;I
    can&rsquo;t find my pajamas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">&ldquo;Did you put them away when you got up this
    morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I think I just
    left them on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">&ldquo;I know you did,&rdquo; Pop replied, &ldquo;and
    since you treated them so carelessly, I figured you didn&rsquo;t
    want them anymore, so I just threw them out into the backyard. I
    guess you&rsquo;d better go out and get them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">I did, and the backyard (which bordered on dense
    woods surrounding a dairy farm) seemed blacker than the bottom of a
    coal mine shaft at midnight, plus the night sounds were more ominous
    than those in an old Tarzan movie. Believe me, I found my pajamas in
    a hurry and scurried back into the safety of the house. Oh, yes &ndash;
    never again did I fail to hang up my pajamas in the morning.</p>
  <p class="western">The other example involved a neighbor, Mr.
    Mallon, and his son, Jack. One evening we were playing on the
    Mallons&rsquo; front porch when I got the brilliant idea that Jack
    should hit his old man for ice cream cone money. He did, and it
    worked. Naturally I was back an evening or two later with an
    amazingly similar idea. Jack went in and spoke with his Dad again,
    and soon we were headed for the store once more. Jack allowed as now
    he&rsquo;d seen the very first ad of the summer for strawberry ice
    cream that day, but I told him I was leaning toward fresh pineapple.
    (Can&rsquo;t you just taste it too?) We entered the store and Jack
    marched right up to the counter to order. &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo;
    I said, grabbing his arm, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d rather have
    chocolate.&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s face assumed a grin so wide it went
    out of sight behind his ears. &ldquo;My Dad said tricking you like
    this would be more fun than an ice cream cone and he&rsquo;s right!
    He didn&rsquo;t give me any money,&rdquo; he finished, by then
    almost doubled up with laughter. I can&rsquo;t begin to imagine the
    expression on my face. Shock? Anger? Disbelief? Humiliation?
    Probably a m&eacute;lange of them all with a generous added portion
    of outrage. I&rsquo;d have given anything I owned to have been able
    to dig a nickel out of my own pocket. Jack, I think, was by now
    rolling on the floor. He may even have been frothing at the mouth.
    He couldn&rsquo;t have been happier if he&rsquo;d owned an ice cream
    store. &ldquo;Dad said this would teach you a lesson,&rdquo; he
    chortled at last. It sure did! I never again attempted to enforce my
    personal greed upon anyone else. I always made certain that I could
    carry my own share of any seemingly joint venture.</p>
  <p class="western">My formal schooling began at the Thomas Edward
    Shields Memorial School. This was a model pilot school named for an
    innovative and progressive teaching genius of that period, Father
    Shields, who was also founder of the Sisters&rsquo; College at 10th
    Street and Bates Road. I frankly remember very little indeed about
    my first years there, beyond the fact that the teachers were
    Dominican nuns whose penchant for theology resulted in an emphasis
    on that which Etienne Gilson, the French philosopher, calls &ldquo;the
    capsule theology the catechism, which it is not an exaggeration to
    say &hellip; is the most important teaching a Christian will ever
    receive throughout his life.&rdquo; I do vividly remember my first
    day at school, however, because I took a beating both at school and
    at home afterward. I had scarcely been deposited by my older sister
    on the playground before school began when I was suddenly
    overwhelmed by some unknown bully. He had me down on the ground and
    was thrashing the daylights out of me. I don&rsquo;t remember why,
    if I ever knew. Just as suddenly he was being hauled off of me by
    what appeared to me as a giant of a young man, and I can still
    recall being dazzled by his neat fur-lined leather gloves. It turned
    out that he was an eighth-grader by the name of John Mattimore. I
    don&rsquo;t think I ever spent a minute on that playground after
    that when I didn&rsquo;t make sure that I always stayed within the
    shadow of John Mattimore.</p>
  <p class="western">I merely thought he was the greatest, as he was
    to prove yet again that very first day. On this, my maiden venture
    without parental guidance beyond Michigan Park, I was admonished to
    wait after school so my sister could convoy me home. Wait for my
    sister? Somebody had to be kidding. (Macho was alive and well in
    Michigan Park in those days.) Once released from school, I headed
    for what I thought was home, no matter that I didn&rsquo;t really
    know where I was &ndash; I merely had to follow the streetcar tracks
    into more familiar surroundings. (For years I&rsquo;ve put down my
    children with how I walked a mile to and from school from the first
    day until graduation from High School. Imagine my chagrin when in
    the course of my research for this exciting saga I discovered that
    it was only and barely a half-mile. But then, inflation has devalued
    everything today.) Naturally I was shocked when my mother didn&rsquo;t
    share my elation at the dimensions of my personal achievement in
    finding my way home without my sister Margaret. &ldquo;Your sister
    will be frantic,&rdquo; she said, and of course she was, although
    more frightened for herself than for me, I suspect.</p>
  <p class="western">She soon showed up in tears, wailing that she had
    lost me and couldn&rsquo;t find me anywhere, and so on. And who do
    you suppose was her comforting escort and fellow-searcher? None
    other than good old John Mattimore again. He had seen her distress
    and walked her all the way home, all the time doing his best to find
    me. Already my oldest grandchild, Bobby, somehow reminds me of John
    Mattimore. He has, it seems to me, a poise and concern for others
    that belies the fewness of his years. He has a certain detachment
    that allows him to step back and survey the scene, make a careful
    judgment, and then proceed with a sound course of action. For
    example, once at a family picnic (2 July 1978), Terri had hurt
    herself somehow. Monica tried to soothe her. &ldquo;Just let her go,
    Monica,&rdquo; Bobby advised. &ldquo;Let her go off by herself.
    She&rsquo;ll come back in a minute when she feels better.&rdquo;
    Clearly, she had to preserve her pride more than she needed
    ministration.</p>
  <p class="western">The only other extensive recollection of these
    beginning school years was an event that occurred when I was in the
    third grade. My teacher was Sister Mary Vincent. She had the
    roly-poly figure of one of these bounce-back inflatable boxing
    dummies, and was particularly authoritarian. The latter rankled me
    somewhat from the start. I soon got enough of the plea-to-authority
    routine from her and my mother to provoke me into a confrontation.
    In those days one did virtually anything in response to an
    authoritarian figure&rsquo;s simple, &ldquo;Because I say so!&rdquo;
    Now, I don&rsquo;t altogether disapprove of this in the very
    earliest years when children are hardly &ldquo;reasoning&rdquo;
    human beings. In fact, I don&rsquo;t disagree with this approach at
    any age level when it is made clear that what is really meant is
    that the issue is to be resolved simply on the basis of what is
    &ldquo;right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">In short, I frown only on that school of training
    that resorts too long to the because-I-say-so syndrome as a matter
    of personal convenience and expediency. And, of course, I deplore
    that school which insists that the recipient of any censure or
    correction must always be made to feel that you do this or that
    because it&rsquo;s fun, or it&rsquo;ll make you feel better in the
    long run, or because of any number of legitimate and practical
    reasons. Believe me! There are many hard and disagreeable things
    that must be accepted or undertaken for no other reason than that
    such is the &ldquo;right&rdquo; thing, and &ldquo;right&rdquo; is to
    be understood as conveying a notion of justice and charity. Anyhow,
    one day Sister Mary Vincent admonished me to do something because
    she said so. I calmly replied that I would not. In utter
    consternation she asked me why, and I told her because my father
    took the opposite view with respect to whatever it was she was
    insisting upon. And, I followed this up, sensing her total
    confusion, by observing that my father disagreed with most of her
    silly ideas. Well, this really tore it!</p>
  <p class="western">Most of you have had nuns for teachers, and you
    can surmise the ensuing dismay and disarray. First Pop was called to
    meet with Sister alone. Then I was summoned to meet with them
    together. I wonder, can anyone imagine who won? I had all the
    control over the situation of a shuttlecock in a badminton game.
    Now, understand, I have not the slightest recollection of the
    substance of the issues involved or the merits in the case. I was,
    no doubt, in error &ndash; I&rsquo;ll even concede it. But the point
    is that is all irrelevant, I was in a &ldquo;no-win&rdquo; position.
    This, I sincerely believe, is what really rankled me then, but what
    today makes me, I also think, especially open to and tolerant of my
    children&rsquo;s side in their confrontations with authority outside
    the home. I have a vague recollection of being amazed at the density
    of the sugar coating with which Sister presented her side of the
    issue (a sort of &ldquo;expletives-deleted&rdquo; approach), and
    also that my &ldquo;monstrous effrontery&rdquo; was considerably
    exaggerated (I was <i>not</i> bold. I was as cool as Humphrey
    Bogart).</p>
  <p class="western">Beyond that, I gained the impression that there
    was a pervading assumption that nuns could do no wrong. There was a
    collateral hint of an assumption that possibly little boys could
    never be relied upon for the truth. No one is quicker to recognize
    injustice than a child who has not yet learned the art of adult
    deviousness, and we are in our earliest days, as Graham Greene says,
    soon &ldquo;accustomed to the moral confusion of adults.&rdquo; One
    thing that I am certain of is that this incident certainly guided my
    receptiveness to Anne&rsquo;s side of the story in her assorted and
    incredible adventures at the Academy of the Holy Names. I felt I
    really knew where she was coming from. So you see, Anne, you owe a
    prayer of thanks to my third-grade teacher that I have not already
    cut you out of my will. She, no matter how inadvertently, lifted the
    scales from my eyes.</p>
  <p class="western">Now, I do by no means wish to conjure the
    impression, even fleetingly, that I was a perfect little angel and
    the perennial subject of child abuse. No way. I freely confess that
    I was often what President Nixon (who is so gifted with a talent for
    elegant expression) might term &ldquo;a [expletive deleted].&rdquo;
    I used to drive our neighbor, Mrs. Gillis, nuts. She had a fetish
    about her lawn which took the form of paroxysms in which she ran
    around with a broom screaming, &ldquo;Stay off my grass!&rdquo;
    Sometimes she&rsquo;d get even more violent and demand that one and
    all &ldquo;Stay out of my yard!&rdquo; So naturally, every time I
    passed her house I just had to dash a few paces in and out of her
    yard. (Why do boys react this way? Do girls, too?) And then there
    were Mrs. Gillis&rsquo; two precious daughters, Annette and Evelyn.
    Invariably on the way home from school, I&rsquo;d dash up behind
    them, grab their hats, and then toss them into their yard, just far
    enough to make them have to walk on the grass. And I did even worse
    things. For instance, I stole loose change around the house, and
    even some that hadn&rsquo;t quite gotten loose yet. And once I was
    even obliquely involved in a shoplifting foray. (George and Maureen
    should enjoy these two vignettes.)</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">The
    money-&ldquo;finding&rdquo; started while my mother was in the
    hospital for what must have been a miscarriage, and my Aunt Edna had
    taken over the household in her absence. (This was the same Aunt
    Edna who had ventured west in 1900 to become kindergarten teacher to
    the Navajo Indians under the leadership of my Great-Aunt Kate. I&rsquo;m
    sure I was the wildest Indian she ever faced.) Anyway, Aunt Edna had
    the unfortunate habit of leaving her change loose in an open purse
    in Mom&rsquo;s dresser. One day I became hypnotized by all those
    shiny quarters, nickels and dimes, so I sampled some. This soon
    became a habit which carried over even after my mother had returned
    home. I&rsquo;d walk up to the nearby deli, buy a couple of fistfuls
    of penny candy, and secrete it in a tree-box (the framing provided
    to support a tree newly planted by the city) in front of the
    Mallons&rsquo; house around the corner, out of sight of my house &ndash;
    a veritable treasure cache. One day I made the mistake of simply
    hiding the loot under the knee pillow of Fran McGuiness&rsquo;s
    wagon. (In those days every kid had a wagon complete with knee
    pillow, so you squatted on one knee on the pillow and propelled the
    wagon with the other leg.) We aggravated a bad situation by
    splitting up the goodies in sight of Mom (who even then had the
    habit of peeking out the window from behind the shades). Of course,
    it didn&rsquo;t help my secretiveness any to be seen with a
    Brooklander (candy always brought strange playmates), and so the jig
    was up, my pocket-picking career was ended.</p>

    An angel (?) with neighbors</h3>
  <p class="western">As for the shoplifting, I really was innocent,
    and it was the McGuinesses again &ndash; this time Goff (for
    Godfrey) and Vinnie (for Vincent). I think &ldquo;Two-bow&rdquo;
    Flanagan was along also. I was with them one day shortly after
    school (which was most unusual, for reasons that will soon become
    obvious), and they suddenly decided to make a pass through the
    Piggly-Wiggly (the granddaddy of all self-service stores) which was
    on 12th street between Monroe and Newton streets. And so we did,
    sweeping in one door, up and down the aisles and out the other door,
    bypassing the checker. They then withdrew to a
    heretofore-unknown-to-me hut behind Haske&rsquo;s Bakery, which was
    next door to the Piggly Wiggly. Inside the hut everyone emptied
    their shirt fronts and pockets onto the floor. One had a coke,
    another a box of cookies, another a pack of cigarettes. They
    secreted all of this under a removable wooden floor panel, where
    there was lots more. This, apparently, was a standard procedure. I
    left as quickly as I dared, frightened to death by it all, and never
    went back. I&rsquo;ve always wondered, since, who would have
    believed me if I&rsquo;d been caught. You count &rsquo;em.</p>
  <p class="western">I have already said that this was the period of
    perhaps my greatest or most concentrated development. Part of this
    development was the experiencing of fear, disillusionment and death.
    To begin in the middle (it&rsquo;s my story, isn&rsquo;t it?), there
    was the shattering of the Santa Claus myth &ndash; an event which
    left me so outraged that none of my children were ever subjected to
    it. It came about one Christmas when I detected a trickle path of
    artificial snow leading from the top of the basement stairs, through
    the hall, to the Christmas tree in the living room. What in hell, I
    wanted to know, was Santa Claus doing coming in the basement door
    rather than down the chimney? (Sherlock Holmes would have been so
    proud!) This was easily parried somehow, but about a week after the
    New Year had begun, I&rsquo;d already located the carefully boxed
    and stored Christmas ornaments under a tarpaulin in the corner of
    the basement. I never mentioned this little bit of detective work,
    possibly because I was so disconcerted by the apparent willful
    deception it evidenced. Santa was a bad scene, and I&rsquo;ve never
    heard any compensating advantage for perpetuating the myth.</p>
  <p class="western">Let&rsquo;s hope Santa Claus is dead. He was
    never very good to me anyway. One year I wanted a jig-saw outfit
    that enabled to making of all sorts of wooden figures and toys.
    Albert Noyes had one and it was really neat. I was told, upon
    presentation of an infinitely inadequate substitute on Christmas
    morning, that a saw was much too dangerous. Another year all the
    guys on the block opted for two-wheel bikes. Everybody got one but
    me, again I had asked for something too dangerous. (I was delighted
    when my grandsons got their bikes. If any of them has an accident,
    I&rsquo;ll die!) I remember how in the weeks following that
    Christmas all the new bike owners would assemble, the little SOBs,
    right in front of my house each morning, take off down Shepherd
    Street, turn left on Michigan Avenue, and disappear out of sight &ndash;
    &ldquo;going to Baltimore.&rdquo; Lord! How I ached to go to
    Baltimore with them. It wasn&rsquo;t until a few years later that we
    moved a little further out Michigan Avenue to 13th and Varnum
    streets, and then I discovered that their sidewalk &ldquo;to
    Baltimore&rdquo; ended half-way down the first block after they had
    turned the corner out of my sight. (Nixon, please help me! SOB is
    too mild a term!) But, happily, even before this I had begun to
    notice how, after only a few weeks, the bikes remained more unused
    than used. It was an early lesson which George MacDonald sums up in
    his remark, &ldquo;Happily, the blessed joy of possession pales.&rdquo;
    I never remember wanting anything ever again like I wanted that
    bike. To paraphrase the old airline ad, I&rsquo;d learned that
    &ldquo;planning to get there is half the fun!&rdquo;</p>

    With sister, Margaret, and neighbor Albert Noyes</h3>
  <p class="western">The emergence of fear in my life had several
    dimensions, but one singular result &ndash; it was fear that led me
    to prayer. (I have since reflected that perhaps this is the only
    route by which macho man can be led &ndash; eventually &ndash; to a
    love of God.) My very first recollection of fear was the immediate
    byproduct of my first confrontation with death &ndash; the death of
    our neighbor, Mr. Noyes, in 1924 when I was six. I can still recall
    the huddled conferences of whispering people. &ldquo;Why, I saw him
    at Mass in the monastery only this morning,&rdquo; one would
    venture. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; another would reply, &ldquo;and I
    understand he complained that he never remembered the hill being so
    steep or making him so tired.&rdquo; But the picture that was on
    hold in my mind was that he had been okay at breakfast but gone
    before dinner. Gone! Quickly, completely, and forever! This gave
    birth to my first recollected prayer &ndash; that God protect my
    parents, and never take them from me and leave me as an orphan. (I
    have since reflected that perhaps I oversold this; my mother ended
    up living with us until well into her nineties.)</p>
  <p class="western">My second big fear was not unrelated in that it
    pertained to sudden, irreversible loss. This was when the token
    black family in the neighborhood (and parish &ndash; there was
    always the need for a janitor, you know) lost virtually all their
    possessions when their house burned to the ground. Their name was
    Thompson, and it was a big family (Catholic, of course) that lived
    in a one-room shanty in a field near the railroad tracks. The one
    and only thing they salvaged was a baby grand piano &ndash; possibly
    the forerunner of blacks&rsquo; status-building super-hi-fi&rsquo;s
    and CDs of today. The strange thing is, their rebuilt place burned
    to the ground again about a half-dozen years later, and again, only
    the piano was salvaged. I thought that was sort of funny, but I
    harbored no such illusions about fire, and forthwith protection from
    fire was added to my litany of pleas for the mercy of God. As Thomas
    Hobbes put it, &ldquo;Fear and I were born twins,&rdquo; but out of
    it all, I at least evolved a lifetime prayer habit.</p>
  <p class="western">In my young life, however, fear had to give equal
    time to disillusionment. I have this dismal recollection of a
    youthful journey to the Washington Navy Yard on Navy Day. This used
    to be a big annual thing in the schools when I was growing up.
    Several classes were loaded into a chartered bus. Each teacher kept
    her own class in tow for the Navy Yard tour, right? Wrong! You know
    who got lost &ndash; I did. But I wasn&rsquo;t too worried when I
    found myself detached from my class and wandering around all alone.
    (Interestingly enough, I also got lost in the Ford Island Navy Yard
    at Pearl Harbor in 1945, and almost missed my plane connection to
    catch a ship in Guam, about which more later.) After all, I often
    became separated from my folks at the museum, as I hung back to look
    at ships, fire engines, and locomotives, while they rushed on to
    waste time reviewing the inaugural gowns of the Presidents&rsquo;
    wives, for chrissakes. My folks would find me &ndash; such is the
    blind faith of youngsters.</p>
  <p class="western">As for getting lost at the Navy Yard, I was a
    good planner (remember?). I&rsquo;d carefully noted the area where
    our bus had parked to disembark us, and the number of our bus. Not
    only that, every Catholic kid knows full well that you can trust a
    nun 100 percent, right? In fact, they either moved the bus or it had
    already departed by the time I found my way back to the original
    parking area. Now, I hadn&rsquo;t rushed to locate the bus. After
    all, I had gotten detached shortly after our arrival, so I just
    continued my private tour. This was a mistake induced wholly and
    entirely by an overabundance of trust. To make a long story short
    (and too late, you say), I had to walk home, and I wasn&rsquo;t even
    sure where home was. So, this was no easy feat (actually it was very
    hard on the feet) for a kid my age living in a much more sheltered
    era. First off, I walked a good bit in the wrong direction, until it
    dawned on me that I was in southeast Washington rather than the
    northeast segment, so I had been following the streets for which the
    alphabetically ordered names progressed away from rather than toward
    home. I first got some real sense of my bearings when I at long last
    stumbled onto North Capitol Street at H Street, Northeast, opposite
    the Government Printing Office. I knew that from there all I had to
    do was follow the streetcar tracks to the end of the line and more
    familiar surroundings. At this point I was still three miles from
    home (the Navy Yard was six), but I didn&rsquo;t have carfare, so
    walk I did. Naturally I was too frightened to ever tell my folks
    about this (they&rsquo;d never have let me out of the house alone
    again), and I don&rsquo;t believe the trusted dear nun ever even
    missed me (my having always been so shy and retiring, as is well
    known). But, again a life-long lesson emerged: never leave home
    without emergency fare for a safe return! Also, one couldn&rsquo;t
    place blind faith in a nun.</p>
  <p class="western">Two other incidents of disillusionment should be
    mentioned. One occurred shortly before age nine, the other shortly
    after. The first related to the day a policeman came to our front
    door to charge me as the culprit who had broken 47 windows in the
    Bunker Hill Elementary School at 14th and Michigan Avenue. We had by
    now, as you recall, moved to 13th and Varnum Street, and it is a
    fact that I often joined neighborhood kids in playing in what then
    was the woods surrounding the Bunker Hill School. But there was no
    way I could figure to prove my innocence. I couldn&rsquo;t even
    begin to account for where I might have been at the alleged time of
    the damage. Mother could. She even produced a time-dated receipt of
    Rich&rsquo;s Shoe Store, where she had taken me that particular
    morning to buy &hellip; you guess. Such an ironclad alibi demolished
    the policeman&rsquo;s until-then dead-certain arrogance &ndash; the
    old &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the goods on you, Lefty, you&rsquo;d
    better come out with your hands up&rdquo; approach. Now he assumed
    his avuncular &ldquo;everybody knows the policeman is a boy&rsquo;s
    best friend&rdquo; approach. Did I know who did it? No. Had I heard
    anyone talking or even bragging about it? No. Could I give him the
    names of some of the boys I played with? Sure, and I did. This was a
    mistake.</p>
  <p class="western">It turns out that policemen are not (always)
    boys&rsquo; friends at all. A few days later the mother of one of
    the kids I had so innocently named cursed me out (literally!) in a
    way that would have made a sailor take notes. &ldquo;How [expletives
    deleted, again and again] did I dare to implicate her little darling
    in this dastardly crime!&rdquo; I had to ask my sister what
    &ldquo;implicate&rdquo; meant. That old lady really scared me. I
    mean, she was as mad as a frothing dog in high summer. So much for
    my admiration of policemen. Live and learn. And it was the same with
    doctors shortly thereafter when I had my tonsils removed. The old
    man just put a little pad of strange smelling cloth over my mouth
    and nose and challenged me to &ldquo;Blow it away!&rdquo; I was
    under the ether before I&rsquo;d taken three good breaths. You just
    couldn&rsquo;t trust grown-ups.</p>
  <p class="western">I&rsquo;ve already mentioned the death of Mr.
    Noyes, but his was only the first of four deaths that marked me in
    this period. The second was the death of the younger brother of my
    classmate, Marie Blanluet. He was killed in the cave-in of a
    home-made cave hut. Several vivid pictures persist. The first is the
    uniform delight of our class on learning that we would be excused
    from school to attend the funeral &ndash; my first. The second was
    the surprise at the small white casket (I was not to see another
    till our son, Herbie, was buried), and the overall theme of joy that
    featured funerals for those who died before the age of reason, and
    therefore could be presumed sinless and therefore saints. This was a
    most welcome theological amendment, after the atmosphere of doom and
    gloom that attended the death of Mr. Noyes in my memory.</p>
  <p class="western">It was even more impressive in the light of my
    third recollection &ndash; the uncommon pedagogical skill and
    obvious holiness of the preacher, Dr. George Johnson, a priest well
    ahead of his time, and perhaps even of this one. Father Johnson, I
    believe, was the guiding genius behind the establishment of the
    Thomas Edward Shields Memorial School, and later (when this became
    St. Anthony&rsquo;s) the model Campus School as an adjunct to the
    Sisters&rsquo; College. He never preached from the altar, but from
    the aisles, walking up and down between the rows of children,
    involving us in dialectical give-and-take. He had a gift for making
    things simple even as he made you think, and he made everyone a
    participant. He is the first preacher who ever made an impression on
    me, and it was a very long time before I met another.</p>
  <p class="western">But the liturgical joy of the Blanluet funeral
    was soon displaced by another childhood death. One of my own
    classmates this time, Tommy Dorsey, was struck by a car as he ran
    down the southeast hill of the little triangle formed by 12th
    Street, Shepherd Street and Michigan Avenue. (This little park was
    also the scene of another tragedy &ndash; a fire! Several times each
    summer the park service provided a band concert by one of the
    military bands. These were real community affairs, like the Fourth
    of July celebrations. Everybody turned out. A wizened little old man
    regularly showed up, with monkey and push-cart, to provide
    fresh-roasted peanuts and popcorn. His open flame for this purpose
    was one evening wafted by the breeze into the cart&rsquo;s
    tassel-fringed umbrella &ndash; and in moments the cart was a small
    pile of smoldering black ashes. The departure of the little old man
    clutching his monkey to his chest was a pitiful sight that still
    lingers after 50 years. Fire is such an ultimate solution. I&rsquo;m
    sure he lost everything he had in the world. We never saw him
    again.)</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, the houses on that side of Michigan sat
    atop a double-terraced hill perhaps 30 or 40 feet high, and Tommy
    came racing down the hill from delivering the evening paper and
    charged right into the path of an oncoming car. Every neighbor was
    soon at curbside, and I found myself standing next to Mrs. Gillis,
    and so over heard her memorable summary of the situation: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    not surprised. He was bound to come to a bad end &ndash; he was
    always walking on the grass!&rdquo; What can I add? She had all the
    compassion of a city bank loan officer. Once again, we were excused
    from class for the funeral, but even more sobering than Mrs.
    Gillis&rsquo;s remark, there was no white casket this time. And for
    the first time, I was struck by the somber thought that, yes, sudden
    death could happen even to me.</p>
  <p class="western">But even this is not my most memorable early
    recollection of death. The one that most often returns to mind
    occurred in March of 1928, when I was ten. One evening my father
    simply took me with him when he left home shortly after dinner in
    the car. At last, when we got to where he was going, he left me in
    the car while he went inside. I didn&rsquo;t realize it at that
    point, but it turned out to be a funeral home, and my father
    remained inside for a very long time, almost as long as he had kept
    us waiting in the sleigh while he talked to friends as alluded to
    earlier. At last he emerged, visibly shaken, and he sat quietly for
    several minutes just slumped behind the steering wheel. He was
    crying. This was the first (and only) time I saw my father in tears,
    and it really unhinged me.</p>
  <p class="western">Finally, when he had regained his composure, he
    turned to me and said, &ldquo;Son, I have just paid my respects for
    the last time to a man who was perhaps the greatest Christian I
    shall ever know. He spent his entire life just helping others. He
    never thought of himself. He did countless large and small favors
    for me over the years, and one time I said to him, &lsquo;Mr.
    Barnum, how can I ever repay you for all the many kindnesses you
    have shown to me?&rsquo; And do you know what he said? He said,
    &lsquo;Herb, just pass it on!' Imagine that &ndash; &lsquo;Just pass
    it on!&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve never forgotten that, and now I hope you
    won&rsquo;t either.&rdquo; (I haven&rsquo;t, and it has often
    fascinated me to reflect that much that I have done, like telling
    this very story now, demonstrates the continuing living force of a
    good Christian, one I never knew.) Later on, my father mused, &ldquo;He
    wasn&rsquo;t a Catholic, you know, but he was more Christian than
    most.&rdquo; Well, that was the first time I came to realize that
    one could, indeed, be a Catholic without being a Christian, &rsquo;though
    this seems to be the rule more than the exception these days. All
    too often we find the (non-Christians) even wearing religious garb.</p>
  <p class="western">There were some lighter times in those days, too.
    I didn&rsquo;t go around with a permanent scowl. (That must have
    come later, I hear you say.) One occasion of great joy was the
    nomination of the Happy Warrior, Al Smith, as the first Catholic
    candidate for President of the United States. This, too, was in 1928
    when I was ten. I can&rsquo;t discuss Al Smith without introducing
    you to my Aunt Lucy, the sister of my father&rsquo;s mother) and her
    husband, Cameron Brodie, or Uncle Cam. She has to be the most
    flamboyant and feisty old lady I&rsquo;ve ever known. She was a real
    pistol, with as much fight in her as an Irishman too long at the
    pub. She&rsquo;d take on the whole world in defending Al Smith, and
    she couldn&rsquo;t have weighed more than 90 pounds &ndash; and
    she&rsquo;d have won more often than she lost on pure fighting
    spirit. She could extol Al for hours, and did.</p>
  <p class="western">Poor Uncle Cam was the exact opposite, the most
    unassuming and retiring old gentlemen you&rsquo;d ever care to know.
    He had a handlebar mustache and eyes that twinkled like a
    fresh-flowing mountain stream in the noon-day sun. And in the face
    of constant (though good-natured) abuse from their two daughters,
    Ethel and Marie (prototypical women-libbers straight out of King
    Lear, if ever there were), he wore a perpetual Irish-pixie smile and
    just kept serenely puffing away on his ever-present cigar. Maybe
    once every two hours he&rsquo;d open his mouth to venture an
    opinion, only to evoke an immediate &ldquo;Shaddup, Papa!&rdquo;
    from Ethel and Marie in unison. I don&rsquo;t recall the old
    gentleman ever getting so much as a word in. You could publish the
    collected sayings of Uncle Cam on the back of the same postage stamp
    that recorded the wisdom of Hugh Hefner. But all this never bothered
    Uncle Cam. Compared to some of the outrageous contentions of Ethel
    and Marie, Uncle Cam&rsquo;s silence exuded brilliance. (I&rsquo;ve
    noted in recent years that this stage is one all men must apparently
    accommodate to as they grow older &ndash; the situation wherein
    their advice is not only never sought or needed, but in which it is
    rejected without so much as a hearing. I&rsquo;ve witnessed Grandpa
    Kirk being relegated to the background in this respect, and have
    already begun to feel the pressure starting to push me to the rear
    at family gatherings. Old age seems to make one irrelevant. My
    recollection of Uncle Cam&rsquo;s cool has been a comfort to me as I
    recognize this stage engulfing me.)</p>
  <p class="western">But Al Smith is the real hero of this episode in
    my mind, so much so that I took his middle name for my confirmation
    name &ndash; Emmanuel &ndash; 6 December 1929. (I also took his name
    in part to earn entitlement to the nickname of &ldquo;Manny,&rdquo;
    after a neighbor, Manny Rice, who in the same year introduced me &ndash;
    unbeknownst to himself, I&rsquo;m sure &ndash; to a lifetime love
    for Duke Ellington and his music.) Aunt Lucy had given me a
    children&rsquo;s biography of Al Smith that I actually read. In
    fact, I clipped an excerpt from it, and still had it (posted on the
    nameplate of my office desk in the Navy Management Office) 40 years
    later! It was what Al called his credo, and unfortunately I&rsquo;m
    no longer able to locate it, but it went to this general effect: &ldquo;I
    know what is right, and I know what is wrong. And if ever I do or
    seem to do anything that&rsquo;s wrong, you can mark it as willfully
    and knowingly done, and hold me to account for it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">I liked that then, and I still do. What a
    difference it would have made if, in more recent history, Richard
    Nixon had shared such a conviction. Anyhow, Al was a man &ndash;
    perhaps one of the last &ndash; who always spoke the truth as he saw
    it, and more than just talking about it, he lived it. He was the
    precise exemplar who later led me (and my brother Tom can vouch for
    some of this) forthrightly to challenge the unbecoming speech of my
    friend Jack Mallon on the way home from confession at the monastery
    one Saturday afternoon. It was the same principle which compelled me
    to write to my first godchild, Norman Lane, and my best friend, John
    McCarthy, when I sensed they were slipping in the practice of their
    faith. Far from being self-righteous actions motivated through
    pride, I can testify that these criticisms took guts. It isn&rsquo;t
    easy to speak the truth, and it&rsquo;s all too easy to shrink from
    correcting someone on the grounds that one should not cast the first
    stone, or for fear of appearing priggish. It never bothered me that
    I might hurt their pride or lose a friend. I saw it as a duty &ndash;
    as a matter of principle. I merely spoke up as I imagined Al would
    have done. He taught me that one had to be responsible &ndash; no
    small lesson.</p>
  <p class="western">It&rsquo;s a bitter pill for me that a man of his
    caliber &ndash; rather than JFK &ndash; couldn&rsquo;t be remembered
    as the first Catholic President. As one final sidelight on this, I
    have no idea what my own father thought of Al or any other political
    figure. I know nothing of his personal politics, and he was a
    political scientist. In the course of researching to write this
    memoir I asked an old associate of his during this period, Dr. John
    Meng, about it, and he said the vote-less District-liners of those
    days never had to take sides and so they didn&rsquo;t. (Dr. Meng
    obviously never met Aunt Lucy!) Choice of a political party or a
    candidate just never came up, he said. One might venture that if any
    political label fit Pop, then it would most probably have been
    internationalist.</p>
  <p class="western">It was also 1928 that saw the Dominican replaced
    by the Benedictine nuns at St. Anthony&rsquo;s. The Dominicans wore
    white habits and the Benedictines wore black habits. Never was the
    white/black, good guy/bad guy symbolism more apt than as I found
    this switch on reporting for the sixth grade in September 1928. My
    teacher was Sister Mary Divine Heart, but it would have been more
    correct to call her Sister Mary No-Heart. She was a diminutive but
    congenital boy-hater. Her loathing for anything male was undisguised
    from the very first minute of the very first day. He favorite phrase
    was &ldquo;Woe unto you!&rdquo; And I faced more woes that year than
    you&rsquo;re apt to hear around a race track in a season.</p>
  <p class="western">The Divine One favored girls to an outrageous
    extent. She lavished praise on them even as she went out of her way
    to devastate blooming male egos. One of her favorite ploys was to
    exploit a boy&rsquo;s inability to answer some particular question,
    building it up into a gigantic display of utter stupidity, and then
    cap it by calling on one of the smart-ass girls to administer the
    <i>coup de grace</i>: &ldquo;Florence, <i>tell</i> John!&rdquo; It
    made you want to splatter Florence like a snowball against a brick
    building!</p>
  <p class="western">The Divine One&rsquo;s well-developed disgust for
    the masculine genre extended even to books which she read to the
    class during the indoor recess. Her all-time favorite was <i>Girl of
      the Limberlost</i>, which was about some little goofball girl who
    made a career out of chasing butterflies, for chrissakes. After
    almost a year of this all the boys rebelled to the extent that she
    at last most reluctantly undertook to assay Mark Twain&rsquo;s <i>Tom
      Sawyer</i>. This was quickly and violently abandoned after scarcely
    a page and a half as utterly disgusting!</p>
  <p class="western">Unfortunately, this was the only elementary
    school year in which I recall confronting any instruction in English
    grammar. I lost. I didn&rsquo;t know, until I went to prep school
    seven years later, that the reason why I flunked Latin four years in
    a row in high school was that I didn&rsquo;t know English grammar.
    Flunking Latin, though, had its good and bad aspects. The bad aspect
    was that my teacher never failed to reproach me with, &ldquo;But,
    John, your father was a Latin teacher!&rdquo; I never could figure
    how she thought her reiterating this would help me. On the good
    side, this did help me to confirm my prior resolution on the married
    state. I simply figured that if God wanted me to be a priest, then
    he sure would have made Latin a lot easier for me. Clearly, this was
    for me the nadir of the educational process. I was passed to the
    seventh grade only on the condition that I attend and pass summer
    school. I not only dreaded the loss of my summer freedom, I was by
    now convinced that I was an uneducable dolt, and I detested school.
    Beyond that, I nursed the conviction that all this was not
    altogether my fault, and so we want to conclude this section on a
    happier note.</p>
  <p class="western">The fact is, one of the most fortunate events in
    my entire life also occurred in this period. This was between 1924
    and 1929, remember. The stock market crashed, but so far as I know
    nobody in my family heard it. Talking pictures made their debut, but
    not as part of my life. I was caught up in games. More than that, I
    invented games (some of which my roommate and I played at the Naval
    Academy years later, and which my brother has passed on to his
    friends). People tried to encourage me to read more. In particular,
    there was a former neighbor, a school teacher named Miss Farrington,
    who would regularly bring me books on her visits to the family.
    There was Martin Johnson&rsquo;s book about Africa, books about the
    explorer Stanley who found Dr. Livingston (as you, too, may have
    presumed), and Admiral Byrd&rsquo;s Antarctic adventures. I read
    none of these &ndash; just looked at the pictures. I do remember
    trying to read the travel adventures of Richard Halliburton, but he
    left me cold. He seemed to be promoting his own image, which seemed
    somewhat phony to me. (I was delighted only recently, in reading his
    autobiography, to note that Eric Sevareid shared my distaste. He
    noted with unabashed pleasure how during his WWII meanderings a
    passing GI cheered him with the news that he disputed Halliburton&rsquo;s
    claim of having taken a swim in the pool at Taj Mahal. No way, the
    GI had insisted, I measured it when I was there and it was only 18
    inches deep! Swim, indeed! My youthful judgment stands confirmed.)</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, ways had to be devised to keep me out of
    mischief. So it was, perhaps, that Mrs. MacKavanaugh one day took me
    with her when she went to visit her roots and relatives in lower St.
    Mary&rsquo;s County, Maryland. We visited a family named Sterling
    which lived in or near Leonardtown. (I notice that the then-current
    phone directory for that area listed no less than eight Sterling
    families there as of 1978.) I have never forgotten dinner there that
    evening. All the way along the last few miles to the house she had
    been exchanging waves to strapping young men working on road gangs.
    Family, she&rsquo;d explain simply. But this didn&rsquo;t prepare me
    for the assembly at dinner that night. They had two long tables, not
    unlike the one in our dining room, placed end-to-end to accommodate
    this family that numbered seventeen children! I remember that at the
    start of the meal there was a loaf of bread at each end and in the
    middle of the table, and all three had to be replaced before the
    meal was ended. It was like one big party, and brimming with love. I
    had never before been a party to such evident happiness. Then and
    there I got what you&rsquo;d have to admit really was a Sterling
    idea. I could not have been more than eleven and I decided once and
    for all that I would have to find a wife who would share my desire
    to have as many children as the Good Lord would possibly allow: the
    more the merrier. Surely all my children owe Mrs. MacKavanaugh a
    remembrance in their prayers, especially Monica, whose middle name
    is after hers &ndash; &ldquo;Louise.&rdquo; As for me, it then only
    remained for me to find a proper wife and determine upon a proper
    life work sufficient to my family objective.</p>
  <p class="western">However, before moving on, please permit one
    final tribute to my personally chosen namesake, Al Smith. I can&rsquo;t
    improve upon a recent testimonial in the <i>Catholic Standard</i>:
    &ldquo;Only one American Catholic politician has been so outstanding
    that decades after his death he is honored annually at a grand
    memorial dinner held (by) the cardinal-archbishop of New York
    attended by leaders of both parties. That man is Alfred E. Smith. He
    is so honored because of the integrity and honesty with which he
    engaged in politics, the steadfastness with which he professed and
    practiced his faith, and the fidelity with which he set an example
    as husband and father of a Christian family.&rdquo; Moreover, as
    Joseph Alsop recorded as recently as 1983, he was the most effective
    Governor New York ever had. How fortunate for a small boy to happen
    upon such a splendid personal hero!</p>

      V. EDUCATION</h2>
  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western">The direction in which education
    starts a man will determine his future life. &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Plato</p>
  <p class="western">I would have to mark the interval of July 1929 to
    September 1931 as the pivotal period of my life. This was when I
    achieved the transition from being a resigned loser to an
    ever-striving winner. This period embraced the events from the end
    of the sixth to the end of the eighth grades. And the depth of my
    awakening might best be gauged by noting that it marked my
    recognition that I <i>alone</i>, and not anyone else, could and
    would set my own course in life! This realization was reflected in
    and modified virtually every aspect of my accommodation with the
    world. And it is fascinating to observe that this drastic
    redirection of my life was reflected on an even grander scale in the
    very flow of the overall history of the period. I seemingly reversed
    course in total harmony with a corresponding 180-degree shift in the
    course of world affairs.</p>
  <p class="western">Between the glorious years of 1927 and 1929 the
    polarity of the world may well have flipped over from plus to minus.
    The year 1927 certainly marked the culmination of the so-called
    &ldquo;golden twenties.&rdquo; This was the year of the greatest
    Yankees of all time. Babe Ruth had walloped a record 60 homers. Lou
    Gehrig had an amazing 175 runs batted in! This was the year the
    Yankees won the pennant by 19 games, and then became the first
    American League club to sweep a series in four games. It was the
    year of the famous long-count Dempsey-Tunney heavyweight
    championship fight, the year Lindbergh reached Paris, the year Henry
    Ford introduced the Model A Ford. Of course, it was also the year of
    Ford being brought low by charges of anti-Semitism, of the
    Snyder-Gray murder trial, of the great Mississippi flood, and of
    Sacco and Vanzetti. Whatever the nature of the various events, they
    were all outstandingly memorable and generally extremely upbeat.
    Then came the crash of 1929, and riches turned to ashes. The whole
    world went topsy-turvy. This, then, was the backdrop against which
    I, in my eleventh to thirteenth years, truly first emerged as my own
    person.</p>
  <p class="western">It all began with summer school following the
    sixth grade. I went to the John Burroughs School at the corner of
    18th and Monroe streets in northeast Washington. This may well have
    been the most pleasant and exciting summer I ever experienced as a
    youth, and it affected me in every dimension &ndash; spiritual,
    physical, and mental. I have already alluded to my cultural
    awakening &ndash; the discovery of the music of Duke Ellington
    through an older neighbor, Manny Rice. To place the time more
    precisely, it too occurred in the early summer of 1929. I&rsquo;m
    able to do this because I&rsquo;ve always remembered the name of the
    song that first attracted my attention. It was <i>Saturday Night
      Function</i> (of which I currently possess a reissue copy, and which
    even today sounds <i>avant garde</i>), and it was pressed on 16
    January 1929 in New York City. So began my lifelong love affair with
    really good music (for which the classical input came only slightly
    later, as we shall presently see).</p>
  <p class="western">Next, as to the spiritual dimension of my
    awakening, the back garden of the Franciscan Monastery, which fronts
    on 14th Street at Quincy, extends to 18th Street just a block or two
    north of John Burroughs School. There used to be a little chapel in
    this garden which sounded the Angelus on large bells at noon every
    day. Strangely, I had never heard these bells either from St.
    Anthony&rsquo;s or from our home at 13th and Varnum Streets, due
    perhaps to either prevailing winds or intervening and muffling
    forest, but they came through loud and clear at John Burroughs. Thus
    it was that I acquired the habit of saying the Angelus every day at
    noon, which habit continues even to the present. It&rsquo;s perhaps
    worth noting that this happy habit was begun when I was out from
    under the ever pushing pressure of nuns for the first time in my
    life. Here was something, at last, I could claim as my very own good
    idea.</p>
  <p class="western">In the physical realm I came into my own as a
    baseball home-run king. We had daily recess, which meant a spirited
    softball game for all the boys. I was soon well established as the
    best hitter, and was challenged only by Johnny Haske, a fellow
    fugitive from Sister Mary No Heart at St. Anthony&rsquo;s. For that
    summer session I recall still that I hit 118 home runs. Most of them
    left the playground, zooming over the bordering hedge, and landing
    on the front porches of the poor folks who lived on the far side of
    Newton Street. Johnny, who was the envy of everybody in the
    neighborhood (because his Dad owned the bakery at 12th and Monroe
    Streets, and he therefore always brought fresh buns for a recess
    snack) had about ninety-some homers. Nobody else was even in the
    competition. Naturally Johnny and I were always placed upon opposing
    teams. It was a great and friendly rivalry, and happily our team
    usually prevailed.</p>
  <p class="western">As for the mental aspect of the summer session, I
    was passed with flying colors, but that doesn&rsquo;t begin to tell
    the whole story. While I truly learned something in all the assigned
    subject areas, my most profound learning experience, and one which
    significantly altered my lifelong outlook, was the radical
    turnaround in my view of women. Up to this point, you may recall, I
    had clearly been classified by my mother as the black sheep, which
    self-image was confirmed and reinforced by a perceived constant
    tattling by my sister, severe beating by a visiting nun, a
    self-serving and unnecessarily mean humiliation at the hands of an
    early teaching nun, and the culminating total devastation of my
    maleness by my most recent teaching nun. Needless to say, I did not
    have too kind an opinion of the entire female species at this point
    in time. It was me against all of them, and I was losing.</p>
  <p class="western">Enter my sixth-grade summer school teacher, my
    first secular teacher, Mrs. Drake. She may well be the key to my
    salvation if, indeed, I ever make it. (God bless you, Mrs. Drake,
    wherever you are!) To make a long story short, I immediately became
    teacher&rsquo;s pet! Good Lord! What a fantastic flip-flop!
    Virtually overnight I went from nothing to king of the hill! The
    whole world suddenly became beautiful and I loved everyone. What a
    grand experience. As they say of the failed joke, however, &ldquo;You
    really had to be there!&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t imagine the profound
    and lasting effect of my discovery that a woman could and did like
    me &ndash; me, the black sheep! I was delirious with joy that
    summer, and the taste of that joy lingers still.</p>
  <p class="western">There was that evening, for example, that my
    parents took me to the new and fancy Tivoli Theater at 14th and Park
    Road, northwest, to see <i>The Bridge of San Luis Rey</i>. When the
    house lights went up between shows, who should be sitting directly
    in front of us but Mrs. Drake and her husband. I excitedly
    introduced her to my Mom and Pop and she said, &ldquo;Your son is
    the best student I&rsquo;ve ever had.&rdquo; Wow! Can you even begin
    to imagine the positive impact this had on my self-image and what a
    radically sweet turnaround this little event represented in my
    still-young life? I simply cannot overstate the profound effect of
    this marvelous woman upon my life. I had never had anyone,
    especially any outsider, take such a continuously upbeat interest in
    me. She even drove me home from school each day, because my house
    happened to be directly on her route to be sure, but she certainly
    didn&rsquo;t have to do it.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">Now one might
    suspect that this experience could have polarized my perspective in
    certain ways. For example, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been unreasonable,
    I think, if I had concluded that secular teachers were to be
    infinitely preferred to nuns as teachers. However, I must confess
    that this distinction never entered my mind until this very instant
    in which I now write. In retrospect, I found this somewhat puzzling
    at first. Of course, from my present perspective, it is quite easy
    for me to explain. I realize now that very little adverse reaction
    on my part was prompted by teaching nuns. In fact, a subsequent
    episode recorded in this very chapter will recount my experience as
    the teacher&rsquo;s pet of a nun. Also, it&rsquo;s easy for me to
    see now that even the teachers who were bad for me were good for
    others. Certainly all the girls must have adored Sister Mary Divine
    Heart. Still, I never made the religious-versus-secular distinction.</p>
  <p class="western">The full explanation for this happy development,
    I am now sure, lies in what happened next. The simple fact is that I
    never had time to draw any such distinction. I marched directly from
    Mrs. Drake&rsquo;s summer school sixth grade into Sister Mary
    Grace&rsquo;s regular seventh grade, and lightning struck twice!
    Yes, I immediately became Sister Mary Grace&rsquo;s pet. It is at
    once remarkable and frightening how my seemingly chance encounters
    with these two teachers so radically rerouted the course of my young
    life. Everything was so beyond my control, and the loving control of
    even my parents. It all just happened that way, or what a different
    story this might have become. Undoubtedly, however, this explains my
    failure to get down on nuns for life. Mrs. Drake and Sister Mary
    Grace were two peas in a pod, and they were both just the tonic I
    then so sorely needed.</p>

    Halloween Chinaman</h3>
  <p class="western">My wonderful relationship with Sister Mary Grace
    all began because I happened to look like and otherwise remind her
    of her all-time pet, a youngster who lived in Elizabeth, New Jersey,
    where she had taught until the beginning of this seventh-grade year.
    His name was Martin Bishoff, and the admiration she instilled in me
    for him is the second reason why my first son, George, also bears
    the name of Martin. At this point in time, Martin had just entered a
    high school seminary after completing the eighth grade with Sister
    Mary Grace. So, he had already begun studying to become a priest,
    and I have no doubts from all the many anecdotes Sister told the
    class over the next two years (for I had her in the eighth grade,
    also) that he was truly a saint. This judgment to my mind is further
    confirmed by the inexplicably sudden but happy death he suffered a
    few years later while still in the seminary. God did indeed, it
    seemed, love him so dearly that He called him home early.</p>
  <p class="western">Sister would read us excerpts of Martin&rsquo;s
    regular letters to her from the seminary almost every week. His
    letters were always amazingly inspiring, and without a trace of
    pious hokum or false modesty. To my young mind, his musings were not
    unlike those I later read by St. Therese, the Little Flower. I can
    vividly remember at once wanting to be like him, to be able to
    generate such enthusiasm and to be so inspirational to others, while
    knowing I never could. Martin&rsquo;s sudden but natural death
    occurred while I was still in St. Anthony&rsquo;s High School and
    Sister Mary Grace was still teaching eighth grade. Sister was never
    again quite the same, at least to me. It wasn&rsquo;t for a moment
    that she doubted his sanctity, but rather that she was apparently
    overcome by her having been so close to such sanctity. And there was
    perhaps an unconsciously keen sense of personal loss that made her
    shrink from forging further personal associations of such a deep
    nature. She never wrote letters again, a thing I was personally to
    regret deeply during World War II and at other extended times away
    from home.</p>
  <p class="western">Sister Mary Grace was such a pivotal character in
    my life (perhaps the primary one) that she really deserves an entire
    chapter, but just a few examples should suffice to demonstrate her
    unique talents and their impact upon me. You have to recognize that
    a seventh-to-eighth-grade boy is the most precocious and obnoxious
    example of embryonic male machismo. They have to be the most
    outrageous and intractable specimens of the whole human species. If
    ever a group deserves the sobriquet of &ldquo;smart asses,&rdquo;
    this is it. Well, it was this very strain of primitive masculinity
    that was Sister Mary Grace&rsquo;s particular cup of tea, and she
    didn&rsquo;t have to resort to even the threat of physical
    chastisement, and she didn&rsquo;t ever need the reinforcement of
    the archetypical, super-mean principal. She could manipulate peer
    pressure like I&rsquo;ve never seen it done before or since.</p>
  <p class="western">Let me illustrate. Let&rsquo;s say that I got out
    of hand. Her technique was as unique as it was inevitable. &ldquo;Girls,&rdquo;
    she would purr, &ldquo;John feels unloved. He craves some special
    attention. So, please pardon me a minute, girls, while I give John
    the loving attention he really needs.&rdquo; This, of course was the
    signal for all the girls to start giggling, even as Sister with arms
    outstretched cooingly approached John. By the time Sister had swept
    John into her arms and was murmuring soothing baby-talk at him the
    girls would be hysterical. This really demolished any tendency to
    act macho. Before long, all Sister would need to do is to begin
    croaking, &ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; and you would damn quickly shape up!</p>
  <p class="western">One other example comes to mind. (You can see she
    really left lasting impressions!) This is the age (or <i>was</i>)
    when boys suddenly realized that they could ignore teaching
    authority with relative impunity. After all, what could a teacher
    really do to you? Meanwhile, your macho adventurousness would
    testify to all the girls what a really big dude on campus you were.
    So Sister calls on John for the answer to some question. John
    swaggers to his feet and defiantly declaims, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    know, Sister.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, John,&rdquo; she purrs, &ldquo;So
    suppose you just stand there until the answer comes to you.&rdquo;
    All the girls giggle. They&rsquo;re with you so far, and Sister goes
    on with her questioning to others. From time to time she comes back,
    &ldquo;Well, John?&rdquo; And John persists in ignorance. The girls
    giggle. After a while it suddenly dawns on John that the giggles are
    no longer with him. They are laughing <i>at</i> him! And just as
    suddenly John interjects the correct answer and is once again
    allowed to shrink into his seat. Believe me, such arrogance is
    ventured only once. Yes, it did happen to this John.</p>
  <p class="western">Such was Sister&rsquo;s marvelous talent for
    controlling so-called uncontrollable boys. But her teaching tricks
    were equally unique and doubly effective. Our catechism class was a
    case in point. It seems I didn&rsquo;t prepare my homework in this
    subject and, when called upon, I really didn&rsquo;t know the
    answers sufficiently well. As alleged punishment I was therefore
    given the daily task of hearing everyone else&rsquo;s catechism. At
    the conclusion, several in the class would get a chance to
    cross-examine me at length, the object being to show me up if
    possible. Well, of course, by that time I knew the lesson better
    (probably) than anyone in class. Undoubtedly this was the
    inculcation of the very foundation &ndash; and a solid one it is &ndash;
    of my theological facility. I was confirmed 6 Dec 1929, but my true
    religious indoctrination transpired in 1929&ndash;1931.</p>
  <p class="western">Let me stop right here and assure any and all
    young parents of the vital nature and value of a youthful
    memorization of catechetical basics. All the key questions and
    answers of life are to be found right there in the basic catechism &ndash;
    Baltimore #2. (Can&rsquo;t you hear Ed McMahon exclaiming to Johnny
    Carson as he pounds the desk, &ldquo;EVERYTHING, <i>EVERYTHING</i>
    you&rsquo;d ever want to know about you and your relation to God is
    <i>RIGHT</i> THERE IN <i>THAT</i> BOOK!&rdquo;) You may come to
    appreciate the richness and fullness of these simple-seeming answers
    only when you have spent the better part of a long life searching
    for better answers. As Etienne Gilson so rightly says, &ldquo;It is
    not an exaggeration to say that instruction in the catechism is <i>the</i>
    most important teaching a Christian will ever receive throughout his
    life, <i>however long or learned it may be</i>&rdquo;! I couldn&rsquo;t
    agree more. Think about that! It&rsquo;s extremely important. You
    can hardly expect your offspring to treat with any sense of
    importance something which they never got, or which was shielded
    from them for the first ten to twenty years of their lives so that
    they could make their own decision. Religion, like a language, is
    best ingrained in formative, youthful consciousness. As Gilson again
    says, &ldquo;The adolescent <i>knows</i> almost nothing, but he (or
    she) firmly <i>believes</i> a great many things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">I believe a little elaboration is needed here,
    because a dramatic change has taken place in the teaching of
    religion since my youth and the youth of my grandchildren. The
    capsule theology we got from Baltimore #2 was solid meat indeed, and
    could satisfy (as it no doubt has often had to) the needs of a whole
    life, even as it was (though perhaps too deep at the time) intended
    to serve one well beyond the early years. But today, &ldquo;Yielding,&rdquo;
    in Gilson&rsquo;s fine phrase, &ldquo;to the illusion that it was
    democratic to treat citizens as morons,&rdquo; they brought
    catechism down to the level of the masses instead of raising the
    masses to its level. Hence the low-calorie diet that children are
    today fed under the name of catechism. So it is that instead of a
    child learning today that the first truths we must believe are: that
    there is a God, there can be only one, and that He Himself has
    revealed His existence to us; the child must rather learn, to take
    one example, that we believe in God because nothing can make itself.</p>
  <p class="western">While the same doctrine might remain, the order
    is different. The God of rational knowledge, Whose existence can be
    attained in various philosophical ways (I paraphrase Gilson
    throughout) is now taking precedence over the God of revelation.
    Before, we first believed that God had spoken to us, and then we
    proceeded to various rational assurances. Now, we first seek to
    assure that God can be known with certainty by diverse arguments
    drawn from reason alone, and only then do we appeal to God&rsquo;s
    own testimony. There is stark difference in these approaches. If it
    is because nothing can cause itself to be that we believe in God&rsquo;s
    existence, then we do not <i>believe</i> it, we <i>know</i> it. It
    is not then an article of faith but a philosophical proposition.</p>
  <p class="western">This state of affairs can be very bad indeed.
    Appealing to reason before appealing to faith necessarily entails
    the risk of resorting to faulty images. Thus: Here is a house. Did
    the house make itself? No. Did this location make itself? No. And so
    on, until: Did the stars, the seas, the mountains, the meadows make
    themselves? Again, no, BUT providing they have been <i>made</i>!
    What is at stake here is the very creation of the world. Images
    depicting man-made products can be very deceiving when the creation
    of the world <i>from nothing</i> is at stake. There is very real
    danger involved in getting the child used to thinking he is in
    possession of unshakable rational evidence when, in fact,
    conclusions rest upon pseudo-philosophical and thus worthless
    arguments. It is, indeed, well to keep in mind the clear-cut and
    straightforward positions beginning with the very first articles of
    the Apostles&rsquo; Creed, especially as it was revealed by the Word
    of God in Sacred Scripture. (Who among you has taught your child the
    Apostles&rsquo; Creed?) The life of faith begins, as of old,
    precisely with faith: <i>Credo in unum Deum</i> &ndash; I <i>believe</i>
    in one God. Thanks to dear Sister Mary Grace, this is the legacy of
    belief with which I transitioned to high school.</p>
  <p class="western">I went to high school at St. Anthony&rsquo;s.
    Inasmuch as this is where I met my wife-to-be and the mother of our
    ten children, this indeed was a happy eventuality, and it is due
    entirely to the same Sister Mary Grace. The fact is, my father
    wanted me to go to Gonzaga. There I would be taught Greek as well as
    Latin, be under the strict discipline of men teachers whom my Pop
    was certain (being oblivious of the superlative disciplinary
    techniques of Sister Mary Grace) could alone handle boys rushing
    into manhood. Also, this would be the best possible preparation for
    a smooth transition to tutelage under the Jesuits at Georgetown
    University, my father&rsquo;s Alma Mater. So, it was set. I was
    offered only one out. If I should win a competitive scholarship to
    St. Anthony&rsquo;s, then I would be allowed to go there.
    Considering I had transitioned to the seventh grade only
    conditionally, this seemed a safe proposition from Pop&rsquo;s point
    of view.</p>
  <p class="western">As for me, this potentially saving proposition
    was viewed as a life or death matter. I had heard from more advanced
    buddies that Greek entailed a wholly new alphabet and a strange way
    of forming letters. I despaired of ever mastering anything so
    complicated. These self-same buddies also carried tales of the
    violent physical punishments meted out in those days by the holy men
    teachers at Gonzaga. Faces were slapped, hands were smacked with
    steel rulers, fannies were kicked with hobnailed boots. The place
    was represented to be about as inviting as a top security prison for
    repeat offenders. Also I would have to ride many hours of public
    transportation rather than merely walk to and from school in
    minutes. It also meant losing old friends and having to make lots of
    new friends. And there would be no girls to operate as a mollifying
    influence, as they had not yet (if the ever did) become sex objects
    to me.</p>
  <p class="western">So, I just had to win a scholarship, and in this
    Sister Mary Grace (probably more through her pride as a teacher than
    through any awareness of my pact with Pop) became my ally. Now, at
    this point I must confess she regarded girls somewhat as Sister Mary
    Divine Heart had regarded boys. That is, she gave them comparatively
    short shrift, but with no venom and no assault on their dignity.
    Rather, I truly believe that she simply felt (as I indeed believe)
    the girls didn&rsquo;t need any of the special attention which was
    at that stage an absolute must for some of us guys. Nevertheless, it
    happened that Sister Mary Grace selected two boys for after-school
    extra instruction the last five months of the eighth-grade year. One
    of the boys was the smartest boy in the class who may well have also
    been the smartest person in the class, Tom Walsh. (He was later an
    usher at our wedding, is the President of the Thomas Walsh Real
    Estate Company, which owns most of downtown Washington, and is
    married to Julia Montgomery Walsh &ndash; the first woman accepted
    on the New York Stock Exchange. So, he&rsquo;s done rather well,
    you&rsquo;d have to admit.)</p>
  <p class="western">Every weekday afternoon, then, from January
    through May, Tom and I (for I was the other selectee, not on the
    basis of any scholastic merit, I assure you, but merely as the
    reigning &ldquo;pet&rdquo;) were subjected to an hour or more of
    intensive tutoring in English and mathematics. I had never
    campaigned for this. It hadn&rsquo;t even occurred to me. It was
    simply Sister Mary Grace&rsquo;s idea, and I never so much as
    suspected it had anything to do with an eventual high school
    scholarship examination. In fact, I hated it, and did my best to get
    out of it. I felt I was being punished. Then came the Saturday
    morning when I sat down to that exam. Suddenly the light dawned. It
    was a piece of cake. Unbelievably, I finished number one! It wasn&rsquo;t
    that the test had been compromised at all, but that Tom and I had
    been so thoroughly prepared. I still can&rsquo;t figure out how I
    ever topped Tom, EXCEPT that somewhere along the way I had by now
    already formulated one of my cardinal rules: <i>If you&rsquo;ve got
      to be somewhere, don&rsquo;t waste the time, make it count!</i>
    Also, I just may have had a slightly better natural aptitude for
    writing than Tom.</p>
  <p class="western">There remain only three other items worthy of
    mention regarding this transition period in my life, all of them
    isolated, and yet somehow vitally related to my growing-up process.
    First, I had my initial experience with a runaway when one of my
    neighborhood friends suddenly took off for points unknown. He lived
    less than a half-block from our house and was an only child. He was
    small for his age and his skin had such an unusual yellow tinge that
    we called him Chink. This built-in double basis for ridicule no
    doubt prompted him to be an extravagant braggart. He&rsquo;d
    apparently badger his parents for the most preposterous gifts, and
    then proudly display them to us on a look-but-don&rsquo;t-touch
    basis. You can imagine the frustration and envy this engendered.</p>
  <p class="western">Naturally, these sessions never failed to produce
    a barrage of put-downs. I remember once when he got a magnificently
    color-illustrated book on fishing by author Zane Grey. Inevitably,
    we thoroughly debunked fishing as a totally unathletic endeavor.
    Another time he bragged of meeting author Damon Runyon. We pretended
    to have never heard of him, and in ensuing days we confronted him
    with news clippings containing such phrases as &ldquo;demon rum&rdquo;
    and &ldquo;dame rumor&rdquo; and asked, &ldquo;Is this the guy?&rdquo;
    (Oh my, we were clever!) It was therefore a frightening and somewhat
    sobering thought to wonder if our derision had caused him to forsake
    the comforts of home and family. I was deeply worried by guilt and
    thereafter became the ally of all underdogs.</p>
  <p class="western">The second item concerns the death of Grandma
    Becker on 26 Oct 1929. She was the mother of the wife of one of my
    mother&rsquo;s brothers. She was very old, and my only recollection
    of her was as a shriveled old lady who always sat, with shawl over
    head and blanket over lap, in a rocker in the center of the living
    room on downtown 10th Street near St. Patrick&rsquo;s. She never
    moved and rarely spoke. After she died I was always awed by her
    empty rocker, still in the middle of the living room, which no one
    ever dared to touch. The really striking thing about her departure,
    for me, was the hushed report at her wake of her dying words. I
    found them very impressive then, and after researching dying words
    as background for the penultimate chapter of this book have found
    none better. For the last hour of her life, it was whispered, she
    just continuously mumbled, &ldquo;My Jesus, mercy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Finally, there was the relationship with my
    mother. It, of course, had been undergoing continual change, as I
    moved from insecurity to humiliation to resentment, to rebellion, to
    disgust, and so on, until suddenly I arrived at that plateau of
    peace that comes with indifference. As was the case with my
    teachers, I realized at last that she, too, couldn&rsquo;t really
    harm or fully control me. So, I unconsciously shifted into neutral.
    I put Mom on hold. I wouldn&rsquo;t go out of my way seeking
    confrontations. I wasn&rsquo;t nasty. I simply tried to minimize
    unpleasantness. Thus, I simply tried to avoid her as much as
    possible. The central reality remained that she no longer threatened
    me.</p>
  <p class="western">So ends this discourse on the most monumental
    period of my transition, at ages eleven to thirteen, from childhood
    to adolescence. As the world went from good to bad, life for me was
    going from bad to good. Little wonder, then, that I have absolutely
    no recollection of the negative aspects of the great stock market
    crash of 1929. My father, as a college professor, had a secure and
    relatively good job. In fact, my only recalled complaint on his part
    during this period concerned his loss of promised raises (Catholic
    University having just lured him from Georgetown). Most likely
    similar situations were the rule in what I now realize must have
    been our slightly upper-middle-class neighborhood (which would also
    account for the across&ndash;Michigan Avenue feuds). It made no
    difference to me that the whole world might be going down if I were
    on the other end of the seesaw. That, of course, was precisely my
    position. This was the legacy of my summer with Mrs. Drake and the
    two ensuing years with Sister Mary Grace. These are the two women
    who most changed my life, UNTIL I met the woman who was to <i>become</i>
    my life.</p>

      VI. LOVE</h2>
  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western">There can be no unity, no good in
    being, where there is but one. Two at least are needed for oneness.<span style="font-style: normal">
	&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;George&nbsp;Lcdr.&nbsp;MacDonald</span></p>
  <p class="western">Looking back now (at age 65), I&rsquo;d have to
    say that the high school/prep school era embracing Sep 1931 to Aug
    1936 was at once the most carefree and most life-focusing period of
    my life. In one way they were my happiest years &ndash; a time for
    irresponsible drifting and dreaming. Yet, my long-range perspective,
    the shape of my entire future and both immediate and ultimate goals,
    were ever coming into clearer and sharper focus. I was, I suppose,
    growing up.</p>
  <p class="western">Strangely, the maturation process had little or
    no relationship with the formal curriculum to which I was then being
    exposed and to which I remained largely oblivious. I was the
    product, I now believe, of two powerful extra-curricular influences.
    The first was the gratis philosophizing of my high school principal,
    Sr. Theresa, who spent fully half of each teaching period on
    non-course matter (such as ethical and moral principles), which
    served to crystallize my goals and ignite my motivational drives. As
    to the second influence, it was as it is in virtually any detective
    story (and such is certainly what any valid autobiography inevitably
    becomes). One need only defer to the apt French phrase &ldquo;cherchez
    la femme&rdquo;! I was smitten with a sweetheart.</p>
  <p class="western">My first day in high school is still vivid in my
    memory. The class was arranged in five columns of desks, numbered
    one to five from the left as we faced the teacher. Almost at once my
    attention was fully absorbed by a dynamic bundle of female energy at
    desk two in column one on my left. She was called &ldquo;a new
    person&rdquo; &ndash; that is, one who hadn&rsquo;t been among us in
    previous years. In response to each and every query by the teacher,
    she spring halfway out of her chair, arm flapping frantically, in an
    attempt to be the first to be called upon. Very often she was the
    only one with the answer, and she always had the right answer. Her
    conspicuousness was all the more overwhelming because such dramatic
    flailing was simply not our style. More than that, she was
    uncommonly attractive.</p>
  <p class="western">Her healthy complexion contrasted sharply with
    the pale and pasty appearance of most of our old girls, and her hair
    was a shining, almost dazzling, black that swished and bounced
    freely in a stylish bob that was sort of pinned back on one side.
    And her figure was just right; not too tall, not too short, not too
    fat, not too skinny, and perfectly formed. But her crowning and most
    compelling feature was her dark, flashing eyes, which had all the
    natural highlights that make-up artists aided and abetted only many
    years later by such as <i>Maybelline</i> could begin artfully to
    emulate. I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off her. By our junior year,
    our constant hawking of each other had earned the teacher-enunciated
    sobriquet of our Mutual Admiration Society. Her name was Kathleen
    Cecelia Kirk, and she was to eventually become my wife and the
    mother of our ten children.</p>

    My first love &ndash; 1932</h3>
  <p class="western">When I first saw Kathleen, she was not yet quite
    fourteen years old. Since this story from this point on becomes <i>our</i>
    story, this seems to be the sensible time to opt for a digression to
    fill in her origin, background, and first thirteen years. She was
    born in Columbus, Ohio, on 6 January 1918 &ndash; precisely 77 days
    (a good biblical number perfection) before I was born in Washington,
    D.C. Her Father, Harry Kirk, was born in Defiance, Ohio, as were his
    parents: George Kirk and Margaret Cavanaugh. His mother&rsquo;s
    roots were pure Irish, whereas his father&rsquo;s were mostly
    Scottish, with a trace of English and Spanish on his father&rsquo;s
    side. A civil engineer post-graduate of the University of Notre
    Dame, he rose to be State Highway Director of Ohio before a change
    in politics in the governor&rsquo;s mansion (happily for me) sent
    him to Washington for a career in a general contracting trade
    association as safety engineer. He was always exceedingly active in
    church affairs, especially street preaching and concern for the
    poor, and was made a Knight of St. Gregory (an order established in
    1831, and conferred on persons who are &ldquo;distinguished for
    personal character and reputation, and for notable accomplishment&rdquo;)
    by Pope John XXIII in 1958. (It&rsquo;s interesting that both my
    father and Kathleen&rsquo;s father received papal recognition, since
    you&rsquo;ll recall my Pop was granted his award in 1930 in
    recognition of &ldquo;service to the church and papacy&rdquo;).</p>
  <p class="western">Kathleen&rsquo;s mother was born Kathryn
    Schindler, and both of <i>her</i> parents were born in Bohemia, a
    province of western Czechoslovakia. (Some Bohemian was even spoken
    at home until the death of both her grandparents.) Like so many of
    my relatives, she, too, was a school teacher. Like her husband, and
    in addition to mothering and nurturing seven children, she was very
    active in church work, and was a driving force in the retreat
    movement and in the war against filth in films as the local leader
    of the National Legion of Decency. (Needless to say, I had to be
    very careful in selecting movies to which I wanted to invite
    Kathleen once we began dating in our junior year in high school.)</p>
  <p class="western">Our children, who only came to know her in her
    later life as a shy, retiring, and self-effacing woman, may be
    surprised that in my initial encounters with her in the early 1930s
    I found her quite formidable. She was a dynamic, no-nonsense, and
    strongly opinionated woman of the highest principles. In fact, I&rsquo;d
    go so far as to say that she frightened me much more than Grandpa
    Kirk ever did. I found him totally preoccupied with other things,
    and hence no threat to me. Conversely, she always seemed quite aware
    of me, and I always felt I was on inspection in her presence. While
    she was never nasty or even domineering, there was never any
    question in my mind that she, as they say, never suffered fools
    gladly. It wasn&rsquo;t until some years after my marriage that I
    really began at last to feel comfortable with her.</p>
  <p class="western">I&rsquo;ll say one thing for Mrs. Kirk &ndash;
    she sure kept good records! For example, Kathleen was born at 9:30
    PM on a Sunday night at 394 Whittier Street in Columbus, Ohio. (Her
    birth certificate specifies Schiller street, but this German name
    was superseded in the wave of reaction to WWI.) And, yes, Kathleen
    was born at home purposely. The attending doctor was Charles Turner,
    and his nurse was Mary McNamara. Kathleen was baptized by Fr.
    Charles Kessler on 20 January 1918 in St. Leo&rsquo;s Church. Her
    godparents were Bernard Schindler (one of her mother&rsquo;s
    brothers) and Margaret (Mrs. George) Kirk (her father&rsquo;s
    mother).</p>

    &ldquo;I told you! I don&rsquo;t like milk!&rdquo;</h3>
  <p class="western">Interestingly enough, our procurement of a birth
    certificate incident to acquiring passports in 1974 brought to light
    the fact that it specified only an infant Kirk-female. Her baptismal
    certificate registered her as Catherine Cecelia. Grandpa Kirk had to
    file an amendment with the Ohio Department of Health, Vital
    Statistics Division, at that (passport application) time to
    belatedly legalize Kathleen. In any event, Kathleen weighed 7-1/4
    lbs. (13-1/2 at 6 months, 22 at one year, and 44-1/2 at 2 years). I
    <i>said</i> Mrs. Kirk sure kept records! Thus you&rsquo;ll also be
    thrilled to learn that Kathleen had her first tooth on 10 October
    1918 &ndash; precise time unspecified! &ndash; and took her first
    step on Christmas Eve, 1918 &ndash; no doubt to grab and open an
    early present. Her mother further recorded that Kathleen talked very
    little before age 2, even as her father insists that she has done
    little else since.</p>

    Two yo-yo&rsquo;s</h3>
  <p class="western">Like my sister, Kathleen also had scarlet fever,
    but when she was scarcely 2 weeks old, and thereby hangs a tale. It
    seems older sister, Margy, had had scarlet fever in February, 1917,
    almost a year before Kathleen was born. At that time everybody had
    to get out of the house while they sealed it up for 4 hours, during
    which time they burned something like a candle which gave off a
    smoke or gas which decontaminated everything. So, Grandma Kirk took
    Margy outside for this operation, utilizing a baby carriage which
    eventually found its way to the attic until Kathleen was born.
    Shortly after birth, Kathleen got her first ride in a baby carriage
    &ndash; an undecontaminated baby carriage, the only thing in the
    house that wasn&rsquo;t decontaminated! So, on the 12th day of her
    life, infant Kirk-female came down with scarlet fever. That&rsquo;s
    incredible! Of course, she also eventually suffered the full gamut
    of normal childhood diseases: measles, chicken pox, and whooping
    cough. This is all a matter of record, thanks to Grandma Kirk.
    Moreover (and like me), she had her tonsils surgically removed in
    July 1922. Finally, you&rsquo;ll be thrilled to learn that she made
    her first auto trip (by Ford, to Defiance, Ohio) in 1918, and her
    first trip without her mother (also to Defiance, this time with her
    Aunt Rilla) in April of 1920. But wait, there is even more
    excitement in store. She partook of her first non-breast food at the
    age of 40 weeks &ndash; malted milk!</p>

    &ldquo;Who says I&rsquo;m chubby?&rdquo;</h3>
  <p class="western">Kathleen is 50% Bohemian and 37% Irish, with the
    balance comprising traces of Scottish, English, Spanish, and perhaps
    American Indian. She was, of course, 100% Catholic. Her earliest
    memories are of living in Holy Rosary Parish in the older part of
    Columbus, until the fourth grade. It&rsquo;s significant, I think,
    that she&rsquo;d identify her earliest memory in terms of her
    parish. Not the least attractive feature of her for me from the very
    start was the obvious centrality of the Church in her life. This
    immediately conveyed the comfortable notion that we shared an
    immense amount of common ground on the most essential aspect of life
    &ndash; our relationship to God. Beyond that &ndash; her church
    orientation &ndash; she can only recall fragments of isolated
    incidents in that period, such as the burning of a wasp nest and the
    day Dorothy got lost at the barber shop. She has no recollection of
    school at all (which suggests she never had problems with studies or
    students). As to the first trip <i>she</i> remembers, it, too, was
    to Defiance, at age 6 (in 1924), when her maternal grandmother died.
    She made her First Communion on 17 May 1925.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">In 1926 the Kirks
    had moved to East North Broadway. Characteristically, Kathleen
    remembers the move as being to Immaculate Conception parish! She was
    pleased that they lived across the street from the convent and only
    a half-block from the Church. She herself confesses that &ldquo;a
    great deal of my life was centered around the church.&rdquo; She
    especially remembers that they were very friendly to the sisters,
    helping them a lot &ndash; like picking cherries and apples and
    raking leaves, and fondly remembers that the nuns reciprocated by
    throwing a party for their children-helpers once a year.</p>

    &ldquo;I hate this outfit!&rdquo;</h3>
  <p class="western">Like me, Kathleen had also been born on a Sunday,
    so we&rsquo;re both fair and wise and good and gay. This latter is
    not to be construed according to the contemporary corruption
    connoting a predilection for sexual homogeneity. Rather, it is
    intended here by way of confirming that, as she says (for me as well
    as for her), &ldquo;This was a happy and contented period in my
    life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Many of my memories [she says], are of things I
    did by myself &ndash; I was somewhat like Mary, a dreamer. I would
    find a private place (usually outdoors) and read fairy tales or play
    jacks. But I also enjoyed playing with others. We had nightly
    softball games in the summer, picked berries in the nearby vacant
    lots, where we also dug &lsquo;caves&rsquo; and built a miniature
    golf course. I remember neighbors fondly &ndash; the Broughtons, an
    older childless couple, and the Winkels with a large family of
    children. I especially remember descending on them on Sunday
    mornings to read the comic section in the local Hearst paper plus
    the magazine section, which was so sensational that Daddy wouldn&rsquo;t
    allow it in the house. We must have been fairly well off &ndash; our
    house was &lsquo;built-to-order.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t remember ever
    having to do without things. Of course our wants were simple, as I
    was always taught never to follow the crowd, but to make up my own
    mind and stick to it. I apparently had a normal number of friends
    both sexes and even one boy in 8th grade who embarrassed me by
    writing me love letters.</p>
  <p class="western">I can&rsquo;t name specific people who influenced
    me in this early period, but my parents <i>must</i> have been
    paramount &ndash; probably Mother more than Daddy, because at that
    time he was quite busy as Director of Highways. Apparently I was
    rarely rebellious, but rather compliant. The only time I can
    remember being impressed by punishment was one time when I must have
    been about 13. I had gone with my older sister and several
    neighborhood kids down to High Street one summer evening. Normally
    we just walked 2 or 3 blocks to a store. High Street was a busier
    place, with a movie theater and several stores and ten to twelve
    blocks away. We didn&rsquo;t get home until dark, and the house door
    was locked. I think this was when Daddy was in Washington, and
    Mother had decided to scare us. She made us wait a while before she
    opened the door and let us in. I guess we must have gone without
    permission.
  </p>
  <p class="western">At this time I was generally content with the
    companionship of my own family. Margy and I were close (we spent a
    lot of time sewing doll clothes for little celluloid dolls),
    although we also played with others. I remember we slept in a
    bedroom large enough to hold easily two double beds (for Margy and
    I, and for the twins). It had a fireplace with one of those gas
    logs, which provided heat for us to dress by on winter mornings. We
    had a very big backyard and one summer we had a garden contest &ndash;
    each child decided what to grow, and then we were judged. I don&rsquo;t
    remember who won. Also at this time, I was independent enough to go
    across town by streetcar to St. Joseph&rsquo;s Academy for weekly
    music lessons. [Perhaps whatever musical talents George now enjoys
    stem from this early maternal discipline, aided and abetted no
    little by his own self-imposed and often strenuous practice.]</p>
  <p class="western">In all events, the Kirk tribe relocated to
    Washington in the summer of 1931. (Oh, Happy Day!) The period
    covered by this chapter, then, extends from our beginning high
    school on 8 Sep 31, the Monday following Labor Day, until Monday, 10
    Aug 36, the day I entered the U.S. Naval Academy as a plebe in the
    class of 1940. These five years were, at least until the post-family
    and job-free 1980s, perhaps the most glorious of my entire life.
    With another huge <i>thanks</i> for the aid of William Manchester,
    let me set the stage for this period of 1931&ndash;36. First of all,
    our children wouldn&rsquo;t have recognized the Washington of those
    days. There was no Federal Triangle of giant government buildings,
    no Jefferson memorial, no Marine Corps Memorial, no Supreme Court
    Building, no Kennedy Center, no Shrine of the Immaculate Conception,
    not even any Constitution Avenue (which was then merely an extension
    of B Street). Even the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was just under
    construction. So many of the familiar landmarks of their growing-up
    years didn&rsquo;t yet exist.</p>
  <p class="western">On the other hand, in the summertime every home
    switched to straw or mat type rugs, inset fly and mosquito screens,
    sprouted awnings at every afternoon-sun window, and installed
    freshly repainted rockers on every front porch. The latter was where
    the late evenings of torrid summer days were spent, until the
    upstairs bedrooms cooled sufficiently to enable sleep. That is where
    the families assembled after dinner to shout daily greetings to
    neighbors, recount happenings of the day, swap stories, sip iced
    tea, and play mind games like &ldquo;I see something green.&rdquo;
    There was always plenty of green around, since our residential
    development turned into Licini&rsquo;s farm precisely at our front
    door. In the woods that extended beyond our home at 13th and Varnum
    Streets, all the way to Chillum Road and beyond, we picked wild
    blackberries and daisies (which we sold at Glenwood Cemetery on
    Memorial Day). One of our huts was two stories high, could sleep
    four (Mom never allowed me to overnight, of course), had
    copper-screened windows, and was secure behind a mask of blackberry
    brambles on two sides and crossing streams on the other two sides,
    which latter were spanned by an honest-to-God drawbridge. And just
    beneath a light camouflaging layer of sand in one of the streams
    there was always a cache of cooling home-made root beer.</p>
  <p class="western">As often as not, a highlight for the kids on
    torrid afternoons would be scrounging for ice chips from the truck
    of the ice man as he made his daily rounds. After all, there were no
    refrigerators or freezers then, or garbage disposals or clothes
    dryers. There were no power mowers, home air-conditioners, automatic
    dishwashers, electric blankets, clock radios, nylons, hi-fi&rsquo;s,
    drip dry, frozen foods, filter cigarettes, vinyl floors, ball-point
    pens, Xerox, Styrofoam, Scotch Tape, tape recorders or cassettes,
    Polaroid cameras, or home hair dryers even for <i>women</i>. However
    did we manage to survive?</p>
  <p class="western">The Great Depression hit bottom during this
    period, with a 15% unemployment rate, over a quarter of a million
    evictions of families from hard-won homes, and a princely wage rate
    of $16.21 per week for a 40-hour work week. Roosevelt got the
    centerpiece of his <i>New Deal</i>, the NRA, off the ground with the
    homey analogy (such as would later become his trademark as he
    launched Lend Lease, which most people today would concede saved
    Europe from Hitler). Thus, in setting in motion the plank for a
    minimum-wage 40-hour week, the president in his fireside chat of 24
    Jul 32 began, &ldquo;In war, in the gloom of attack, soldiers wear a
    bright patch on their shoulders to be sure that comrades do not fire
    on comrades. On that principle, those who cooperate in this program
    must know each other at a glance.&rdquo; As Manchester remarks, &ldquo;The
    implication was plain &ndash; do your part or lie low.&rdquo;
    Regarding this awesome power of presidential persuasion, Will Rogers
    observed something to the effect that FDR could take a complicated
    theme like banking and make it sound so simple that even bankers
    understood it. Hey! This was, for us, really &ldquo;way back when&rdquo;
    &ndash; the so-called good old days.</p>
  <p class="western">In 1933 a hotel room on Park Avenue in NYC went
    for $7 per night. A new Chevy cost $565. You could eat out in a
    stylish restaurant for $2. Steak was 28-1/2 cents a pound, milk was
    10 cents a quart, and bread was 6 cents a loaf. Hey! Lawyers led the
    professional income list at $3800 a year, while doctors struggled at
    $2900 and dentists at $2200 a year. Servants earned $1675 and
    teachers $1300, while construction workers sweated for $870 and coal
    miners broke their backs below ground for a pittance of $750 per
    year. Times were really rough and primitive by today&rsquo;s
    standards.</p>
  <p class="western">Talk about primitive! This was when FDR flew to
    Chicago for his first acceptance speech in one of Henry Ford&rsquo;s
    old tri-motor airplanes, which were not-always-affectionately known
    as the tin goose. Talk about primitive! Did you realize that FDR was
    the first president to actually have a telephone on his own desk?
    Talk about &ldquo;way back when&rdquo;! This was when the District
    of Columbia was only 26% black, rather than the other way around.
    But, we even then had cherry blossoms, and though the Redskins
    weren&rsquo;t to come to town &rsquo;til 1937, we had a baseball
    team that had been World Champions in 1924 and would repeat in 1933.
    And God was still very much alive, although it has been reported
    that He was something of a prig. All in all, it was a nice time and
    a nice place to stretch for adulthood, as we did through high
    school, where we spent the bulk of this period.</p>
  <p class="western">Ah, high school. What an ambiguous term &ndash;
    <i>high</i> school &ndash; a sort of built-in contradiction in
    terms. Did high refer to the level of academic proficiency, the
    spirit or demeanor of the students, the range of fees and tuition,
    or what? Actually, I suppose, the ambiguity is warranted, as I guess
    high school was different things to different people. In many major
    respects it was a terrible waste for me, as I largely frittered away
    four precious years of my life. Let me yield to Eric Sevareid: &ldquo;The
    high school period, in America anyway, is surely the worst period in
    a man&rsquo;s life &ndash; the most awkward, uncomfortable, inept
    and embarrassing of all times. And the most fruitless. It is
    astounding how little one is taught in these schools, or how little
    one absorbs of what they might be trying to teach.&rdquo; My
    experience certainly verifies this, with the important exception of
    the aforementioned crucial extracurricular forays by Sr. Teresa into
    the fields of philosophy and theology, and the awakening and
    stimulation of an abiding interest in literature by Sr. Regina
    (about whom more later).</p>
  <p class="western">I think John MacDonald has highlighted the nature
    and source of some of the problems. &ldquo;Thus, The idea of
    providing dozens, even hundreds, of electives for high school
    students is as ludicrous as providing a patient in the emergency
    room with a list of diagnoses from which to choose.&rdquo; Of
    course, they didn&rsquo;t have any electives in our high school, but
    I was aware that all my peers attending other schools in the area
    enjoyed such freedom, and I&rsquo;m afraid that did incite a certain
    degree of resistance to what was in fact being taught. But there is
    more involved here. John D. MacDonald again provides an interesting
    insight:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Education should be something which should
    be apart from the necessities of earning a living, not a tool
    therefore. It needs contemplation, fallow periods, the measured and
    guided study of the history of man&rsquo;s reiteration of the most
    agonizing question of all: WHY? Today the good ones, the ones who
    want to ask why, find no one around with any interest in answering
    the question, so they drop out, because theirs is the type of mind
    which becomes monstrously bored at the trade school concept. A
    devoted technician is seldom an educated man. He can be a useful
    man, a contented man, a busy man. But he has no more sense of the
    mystery and wonder and paradox of existence than does one of those
    chickens fattening itself for mechanical plucking, freezing and
    packaging.</p>
  <p class="western">I was made strongly aware of this as I walked
    alongside Northwood High School en route every week to volunteer at
    University Nursing Home after I retired. Alleged students would be
    racing away by noon, and with nary a book in sight, aimlessly
    seeking fun and games. There was no apparent thought of tomorrow.
    (Kids who opt for browsing through Europe between high school and
    college must sense the need for a time-out to get their bearings.)
    Thank God Sr. Teresa provided the answers to the fundamental &ldquo;Whys?&rdquo;
    that salvaged my high school experience. I provided the requisite
    &ldquo;fallow periods&rdquo; &ndash; like whenever she switched to
    Latin or trigonometry.</p>
  <p class="western">Of course many may say that what I needed then
    (what any boy that age needed) was a strong masculine teacher. I
    might go along with that proposition except for one thing: being in
    a coed school is as effective as masculine teachers when it comes to
    keeping macho young males in line. Where a male teacher can only
    rage at academic ineptitude, the laughter and ridicule of the
    opposite sex within one&rsquo;s peer group can be truly devastating.
    It shapes up a show-off in a hurry. No guy wants to look stupid in
    front of his girl. Eric Sevareid elaborates the plus aspects of a
    coed high school education: &ldquo;By being and working among girls
    (as in coed high school), [a boy] can acquire that peculiarly
    American thing &ndash; a natural approach to women as friends and
    even as comrades, not purely as sex objects&hellip;&rdquo; (Well,
    he&rsquo;s entitled to his opinion in the last respect!) In all
    events, I&rsquo;m certain in my own case that being under the gun of
    the flashing dark eyes of my future spouse did more to make me shape
    up in high school than the most iron-fisted Christian Brother could
    have. Not only that, with an opportunity to see her at school every
    weekday, there was no way I could ever be tempted to play hooky. In
    fact, I enjoyed seeing her regularly in high school so much that I
    actually grew to hate weekends.</p>
  <p class="western">I don&rsquo;t know that I could precisely state
    when it was that one might technically say that we were in love, but
    I&rsquo;m quite sure that such was indeed the case long before
    either one of us really knew it. We were 13-1/2 years old when we
    first met on 8 September 1931. We graduated in early June of 1935.
    We became engaged &ndash; absolutely! &ndash; on 29 July 1935. We
    were only about 17-1/2, but I think we can safely say some 40-plus
    years later that it certainly was for real by that summer of 1935.
    Pat Conroy expresses my sentiments well &ndash; &ldquo;I do not know
    when I fell in love &hellip; but that does not matter&hellip; All I
    know is that there came a point when I did not feel alive when I was
    not with her or talking to her on the phone or writing her a letter.
    She became part of every thought, citizen of every dream.&rdquo;
    (Thus, I find the apparent indifference of the alleged young lovers
    of today incomprehensible.) I can remember the serenity when I was
    with her, the empty longing when we were apart. It&rsquo;s just like
    Tom Robbins has said, &ldquo;Fall in love, visit both heaven and
    hell for the price of one.&rdquo; And thank God for running,
    swimming, and handball &ndash; all of which helped to burn off the
    surging energy. Baseball was almost too passive, which was the only
    reason in the world why I focused on pitching &ndash; to really keep
    busy!</p>

    Before High School &ndash; 1931</h3>
  <p class="western">Meanwhile, high school itself was sort of weird.
    There was no history, and that was a subject I really liked. The
    poor history-teaching nun was so old and senile that she was
    practically inarticulate. She certainly was inaudible. Science
    courses were virtually non-existent. We had what was laughingly
    called the chemistry laboratory, which was a conventionally
    furnished classroom with three tables at the front with Bunsen
    burners and a small wall cabinet with a few jars of miscellaneous,
    mostly white powders, and a few test tubes and flasks. That was it.
    The only chemistry experiment I remember was the day that all the
    boys got to give a demonstration of a teacher during the summer by
    making soap (&ldquo;saponification&rdquo; &ndash; and now you know
    why I remember it!), while sister helped the girls to make their own
    cold cream. As for the math courses, they were rudimentary. Grammar
    was overlooked in favor of literature which was (unfortunately) then
    OK by me. The foreign language (French) was taught by the science
    teacher. Enough said. (Besides, she had a boy pet, and I wasn&rsquo;t
    it.) As for Latin, I&rsquo;ve already mentioned what a great
    philosophy teacher the principal was. (And it really wasn&rsquo;t
    her fault that I never learned Latin, because I didn&rsquo;t learn
    English grammar until the year <i>after</i> high school.)</p>
  <p class="western">Our fabulous principal, who was both loved and
    feared, was affectionately known as <i>the Mayor of Brookland</i>,
    and not so affectionately known as Buck &ndash; in deference to her
    teeth, which would have shamed any self-respecting chipmunk. She was
    an excellent disciplinarian, tough but extremely fair, and she had a
    good sense of humor (which means she could even laugh at herself).
    She gratuitously and incidentally taught ethics, logic, etiquette,
    civics, and above all a love for liturgy. She was a great teacher in
    the sense conveyed by Pat Conroy, as &ldquo;one who leaves me tame
    and grateful for the new language &hellip; purloined from other
    kings whose granaries are full and whose libraries are famous. [She]
    tells me that teaching is the art of theft: of knowing what to steal
    and from whom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Sister Teresa saturated us in the Mass, including
    vestments and appurtenances (chalice, paten, etc.), as well as the
    most arcane aspects of rituals for the different seasons of the
    liturgical year. We boys sang a full couple hours of tenebrae in
    Latin each appropriate night of Holy Week solo, by turns. She also
    fully explicated the nuances of making good confessions, which also
    got her into what might be termed &ndash; as close as we ever got to
    it &ndash; sex education. And she provided for superb annual
    retreats. I still remember our retreat master of junior year whom
    she had back for our senior year by popular demand, a Fr. Mendalis.</p>
  <p class="western">Our children will recognize his influence when I
    merely state that it was he who inculcated in me the habit of &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
    leave this or any exercise without acquiring at least one new good
    habit.&rdquo; At his first retreat, I opted to learn to always make
    the sign of the cross precisely and deliberately as though I was
    indicating to, say, Diocletian or Domitian, that I was a Christian
    prepared to die. (I had been appalled at the mosquito-slapping that
    passed for the sign of the Cross by the good priests at the
    Monastery and Dominican House where we often attended mass with my
    Father.) At his second retreat, I acquired the habit of always
    saying, &ldquo;My Jesus, I adore thee and love thee,&rdquo; whenever
    I genuflected. Small things to be sure, but it&rsquo;s a good
    discipline that we tried to instill in our children at every Lent
    and Advent.</p>
  <p class="western">I said I&rsquo;d get back to Sr. Regina, who
    taught us literature. She introduced me to <i>Lycidas</i>, <i>Paradise
      Lost</i>, <i>Elegy in a Country Churchyard</i>, and much, much more.
    Most especially, she introduced me to Francis Thompson&rsquo;s <i>The
      Hound of Heaven,</i> which is the inspiration for Graham Greene&rsquo;s
    greatest novel, <i>The Power and The Glory</i>. The latter was
    originally entitled <i>The Labyrinthine Ways</i> after the opening
    lines: &ldquo;I fled Him down the nights and days, I fled Him down
    the labyrinthine ways&hellip;&rdquo; For some mysterious reason I
    loved that poem, and it sure was good to me. It became the basis and
    substance of my stock exam essay for my Naval Academy entrance exam
    and every year thereafter at the Naval Academy (where instructors
    changed about every 60 days). And the strange thing is, I never
    discussed beyond the first dozen or so lines (if indeed I even ever
    read it further).</p>
  <p class="western">This proved sufficient, after the example I read
    early on in high school in a small book entitled Boners. It seemed a
    college guy taking a final exam in psychology had to write an
    extensive treatise on some arcane aspect of the four temperaments.
    He found the going tough, so in the middle of the second of what had
    to be 5 pages he wrote, &ldquo;To be honest, that&rsquo;s all I know
    about the assigned subject, but I&rsquo;ve learned enough psychology
    from you to know that you can&rsquo;t possibly wade through five
    pages of this stuff from forty-some students. Therefore I propose to
    fill the rest of my 5 pages with a report on yesterday&rsquo;s ball
    game.&rdquo; Well, he got A for the course. The trouble is, he
    almost went nuts afterward wondering if the prof had ever gotten to
    the ball game part or not. (I myself successfully did this on my
    English entrance exam, when I switched halfway through from a
    critique of Edmund Burke to an analysis of the Hound of Heaven &ndash;
    with the same resulting doubt.)</p>
  <p class="western">Well, Sister Regina was good for me. She
    encouraged me to read, and she encouraged me to write. I owe her a
    great deal, as writing became one of my professional strengths (as
    those who persevere to Chapter <a href="#professional">XVIII.
    </a><a href="#professional">PROFESSIONAL</a> will discover). It was
    not so for Kathleen, or for most of the girls. I think it&rsquo;s
    safe to say that most of them detested Sister Regina. The problem
    was, she did seem willfully to prod the girls to the breaking point
    by ridiculing them. If she sensed a breakdown into tears was near,
    she became like a hungry lion sniffing fresh meat in the jungle. She
    moved in for the kill. She really seemed somewhat sadistic in this
    respect, and she became oblivious to all else going on around her as
    she and her victim locked in mortal exchange. She simply <i>had</i>
    to reduce the girl to tears. Tears signaled the home run, the
    touchdown, the conquest.</p>

    Charlie looks like who?</h3>
  <p class="western">I can&rsquo;t recall that she ever reduced
    Kathleen to this. I think not, or I would have remembered it and
    probably hated Sister Regina myself for it. Besides, Kathleen was
    much too cool &ndash; she knew who she was. But I <i>do</i> remember
    her reducing possibly the smartest girl in the class to tears on
    several occasions. We boys never understood this &ndash; certainly I
    didn&rsquo;t. At first we liked it, because it not only spared us,
    it brought down the super-students (always female) who always made
    us look bad. Eventually our sympathies transferred to the generally
    innocent girls. I do remember seeing Aunt Gertie once reduced to a
    wet dishrag by good Sister Regina, and I assure you Aunt Gertie is
    no dummy. As I said earlier, high school was sort of weird.</p>
  <p class="western">I did a lot of reading on the side, most of it
    second-rate stuff. An exception, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, was
    an addiction for Edgar Rice Burroughs. I&rsquo;m certain he was <i>the</i>
    catalyst who initially nudged me into bookworld. I&rsquo;m equally
    certain that he was the reading-impetus for son John. I was
    therefore happy to note in a recent (1983) edition of Sunday&rsquo;s
    <i>Parade</i> that the celebrated sci-fi author Arthur Clark had
    this to say of ERB: &ldquo;His influence has been enormous and is,
    even now, underrated.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t agree more! Clark then
    added, &ldquo;A writer who can create the best-known character in
    the whole of fiction (Tarzan) is not to be ignored.&rdquo; So I
    started with ERB, then went on through all the Frank Merriwell
    stories, and even got into a little Tom Swift and Horatio Alger.
    This was all relatively harmless fare, but most importantly, it got
    me hooked on reading and taught me the worth of a library as a
    source of about anything you&rsquo;d ever want to know. No small
    lessons these.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">With all, I think
    Kathleen and I remained largely oblivious to the outside world as we
    grew more and more comfortable within the tiny cocoon of our
    all-fulfilling mutual interest. FDR was inaugurated for the first of
    four terms. I delivered the Washington Daily News then. This was a
    no-Sundays daily that sold for 1 cent a copy! That one cent was my
    share of the company&rsquo;s income. They made their way on
    advertising. This experience provides the earliest example of what I
    later came to recognize as my own professional trademark, and the
    trait that I&rsquo;ve found most difficult to trace. Let me
    elaborate. I inherited a route. I&rsquo;d had it only a few days
    when it occurred to me, &ldquo;Hey, this is a stupid way to do it.&rdquo;
    I started at one inherited random point, and finished at another
    random point, and in between I retraced many steps. So, I got a map
    of the area, spotted all my customers thereon, and proceeded to
    evolve the most step-saving route possible, commencing and ending at
    points most convenient to me. This really upset my route manager:
    &ldquo;Nobody has ever fooled with the regular way before!&rdquo;
    &ldquo;But it cut my delivery time in half!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">This same trait
    carried over later in my senior year when I took on a more
    remunerative Post route (Jan 1935), which even included the signing
    of a formal contract. It also entailed the addition of the even-then
    huge Sunday edition. We used a shoulder bag rather than a cart then,
    and whereas I had about a 100-customer route, the bag held only 20
    Sunday papers. Once again, it was traditional that all papers be
    dropped by the route manager at the route boy&rsquo;s home. I said,
    &ldquo;No way!&rdquo; and insisted on multiple drops of 20 papers
    each at designated points along my actual route line, which didn&rsquo;t
    start at my house. This innovation, too, astounded the route
    manager, but it sure eased and sped my deliveries. Finally, I even
    changed the set-up during the month of May so I ended up at 6 AM at
    the Monastery, where I could attend outdoor mass in the Lourdes
    Grotto in their garden.</p>

    Washington Post newspaper carrier contract<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote6anc" href="#sdendnote6sym"><sup>6</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">Let me cite just one more example of this
    early-on analytical bent. At some point in this period, I undertook
    to write a book on <i>Coaching Football</i> in long hand. I&rsquo;d
    read all the relevant books on the subject available through the
    neighborhood library and simply found them arbitrary and otherwise
    totally inadequate. My effort started from scratch &ndash; almost
    like Max McGee&rsquo;s attribution to Vince Lombardi&rsquo;s
    back-to-basics presentation after one of his team&rsquo;s few
    undistinguished efforts: &ldquo;This is a football.&rdquo; I started
    by outlining the particular attributes appropriate to the various
    offensive and defensive positions. I then matched up these
    qualifications. For example, it turned out that offensive guard and
    defensive linebacker had nearly matching characteristics. Thus I
    originated the then-startling idea (years before platooning and
    special teams) that a given guy would be best suited for different
    positions on offense and defense. Thus my system would re-position
    every player on the team according to whether on offense or defense
    &ndash; a then-unheard-of proposition.</p>
  <p class="western">I next outlined a series of measurements and
    tests designed for selecting individuals for the various positions
    (much later formalized in scouting combines&rsquo; work-out camps).
    These included grading positions according to the relative
    importance of height, weight, vertical jump, speed, agility, AND
    hand size (as appropriate to all potential ball-handlers). Then I
    designed a system for labeling plays in terms of the initial
    ball-handler (this was before the general use of the T-formation,
    which operated solely through the quarterback), AND the number of
    the <i>offensive</i> hole or point of attack. Incredibly, systems
    then in use numbered plays by <i>defensive</i> hole numbers, when in
    fact the offense had no assurance of how many defensive players
    would line up where, while the offense was required to have seven
    men on the line. Finally, I had the idea (this was 1931&ndash;36!)
    that the center would be numbered in the 50&rsquo;s, guards in the
    60&rsquo;s, tackles in the 70&rsquo;s, ends in the 80&rsquo;s, etc.
    Many years later, the pros claimed credit for many of these
    <i>innovations</i>.</p>
  <p class="western">All of the foregoing, you will note, predates any
    analytical training that might conceivably be ascribed as having
    been acquired or honed by the highly scientific slant of the Naval
    Academy curriculum. At the same time, such analytical questioning of
    the status quo approach or methodology vs. some ostensible objective
    and consequent detailed planning was hardly the forte of my
    absent-minded-professor father. As hinted at much earlier, this
    highly profitable personal trait was acquired from my mother, and I
    discovered this ONLY after I began this autobiography!</p>
  <p class="western">So this period roughly embraces the four years
    between FDR&rsquo;s first inauguration, when the red-white-blue ink
    of the American flag on the front page of the News left my hands
    brick red, to FDR&rsquo;s second inaugural, when I marched in his
    parade in a pouring rain as a midshipman in the U.S. Navy. (Did you
    realize that cadets in the U.S. Military Academy were not then in
    the U.S. Army? This seemingly small distinction turned out to be of
    vital importance to me. Being in the U.S. Navy while at USNA meant
    that my 4 years there counted in my years of government service for
    civil service retirement purposes. It was not so for the
    then-graduates of the USMA!) My personal highlight re the 2nd
    inauguration is that, although I was only a plebe, I got to yell the
    battalion marching orders during the parade, because I was the only
    one with enough balls to be heard the length of Pennsylvania Avenue.
    This was fortunate, because I never rose to sufficient rank as a
    first classman to ever issue order one. But, we&rsquo;re getting
    ahead of or away from our so-called story.</p>
  <p class="western">This is, after all, a story of love. Well, it
    turns out that my princely newspaper route income conferred a
    certain independence upon me. My friend, John McCarthy, and I would
    collect enough every Friday evening to go to the</p>

    Sweet sixteen &ndash; 1934</h3>
  <p class="western" style="text-indent: 0in">Jesse Theater at 18th
    and Franklin streets to see the latest Ken Maynard western. It also
    afforded me sufficient funds to sneak downtown occasionally and buy
    a new Isham Jones or Duke Ellington record (and, one time even a
    Virgil &ldquo;trot,&rdquo; the same being an English translation of
    the Latin). By 1934 I was even visiting the Little Tavern still on G
    street near 15th where I&rsquo;d get two hamburgers and a draft
    beer! Of course I wasn&rsquo;t old enough, but (luckily for
    faint-hearted me) I didn&rsquo;t realize that, and I was by then a
    big boy. More than all this, my meager income even provided the
    means for me to consider and ultimately accomplish dates with my
    sweetheart, Kathleen. Now my life really blossomed into a thing of
    beauty!</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">The actual
    dating, which began in junior year, was preceded by a series of
    weekend gatherings at the home of Florence Oliver (of 6th-grade
    Florence-tell-John fame). At some point during high school her folks
    initiated these get-togethers of some 10 to 12 boys and girls of our
    class and their immediate neighbors. I can remember Florence, and
    neighbor Hope Haverty, Chick Chilemi, Joe Waring, several others,
    and, of course, Kathleen. It was Florence who taught me to dance to
    the extent I can. And, once I felt sufficiently adept, I shifted to
    Kathleen, never to return. (I hope you might agree that Florence
    really &ldquo;owed me one.&rdquo;) It was on the way home from one
    of these gatherings that I first kissed Kathleen. It happens that
    Joe Waring had a Ford with a rumble seat. You really had to be
    there, but the fact is that Kathleen and I were packed in there with
    another couple whom I don&rsquo;t even remember. It was so tight
    that the girls had to sit on our laps, and thus it was that
    Kathleen&rsquo;s and my face came into such close juxtaposition that
    suddenly it just happened. It was, in a word, &ldquo;Titanic&rdquo;
    &ndash; a &ldquo;Night to Remember.&rdquo;</p>

    Kirk tribe &ndash; Winter of 1934</h3>
  <p class="western">It was shortly after this that these gatherings
    became unacceptable due to insufficient privacy for return
    engagements of the delightful happening. I was so afraid of being
    turned down via Mrs. Kirk&rsquo;s presumed disapproval of such early
    dating that I put off even attempting a private date until almost
    the entire summer had passed. Finally, I risked a call one sunny
    afternoon in late August. I proposed we take in <i>The Lives of a
      Bengal Lancer</i>, a feature co-starring Gary Cooper and Franchot
    Tone about a couple of British soldiers in India. The movie had the
    Legion of Decency&rsquo;s A rating, but I still sweated it out on
    hold as Kathleen solicited her mother&rsquo;s permission.</p>
  <p class="western">Surprise! It was granted. Then began my second
    worry. I had no car, and I had to confess that we would have to go
    by public streetcar &ndash; the trolley. No matter. So that&rsquo;s
    the way it all began. I&rsquo;d roller skate the 2-and-1/8 miles
    that separated our homes, walk to the trolley for the ride downtown,
    see the show, and then reverse the travel process. It was long and
    tedious, but delightful, and though we were in public, we were
    alone. A week or so later we repeated the deal for <i>Oliver Twist</i>.
    Horror of horrors! Florence, no less, spotted us downtown, and so we
    became a gossip item in the first issue of our high school paper as
    we began our senior year. So much for privacy!</p>

    Joe Waring and <i>Florence</i></h3>
  <p class="western">I&rsquo;ve already alluded to Isham Jones and the
    Duke. Radio had assured my introduction to and currency in popular
    music. We even had a wind-up Victrola, and so I bought a couple
    records. They drove my father wild. He didn&rsquo;t dig jazz any
    more than I dig rock and roll. I&rsquo;d sit with my head almost
    inside the radio when Isham Jones was on. I learned years later that
    he was the original musician&rsquo;s musician, legendary for his
    craftsmanship and insistence on ensemble precision. His men were all
    readers, and among them was a young clarinetist named Woodrow
    Herman. (Kathleen and I were to catch him at Blues Alley in 1982 &ndash;
    &ldquo;Woody Herman and his Herd.&rdquo;) This proved I knew my
    modern music. Woody is one of the few white jazzmen with staying
    power. Andre Previn said of him, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Duke, then
    there&rsquo;s the Count, and Woody takes all the rest!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s
    true. His Herds, like the original Isham Jones group, are renowned
    for sharpness and drive! This, then, was the time (1935) when
    so-called &ldquo;swing&rdquo; was born. But it was also the time
    when my interest and subsequent love of the classics was born, for
    it was then that Kathleen gave me my first classical record &ndash;
    Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s Fourth Symphony backed by Cesar Franck&rsquo;s D
    Minor. They&rsquo;re favorites even today.</p>
  <p class="western">Still, it wasn&rsquo;t all fun and games. The
    approach of high school graduation, together with my emerging love
    for Kathleen, compelled looking ahead to the future. I had to start
    thinking of how I might earn a living, marry a wife, and support a
    family. This was a frightening but clearly an urgent project. On the
    home front, 1932 had witnessed the routing of the bonus army from
    D.C. In 1933, Hitler came to power in Germany. In 1934, New York&rsquo;s
    Mayor LaGuardia was reading the funnies on radio as NY papers went
    on strike. Fr. Coughlin was inveighing against the Jews, and FDR was
    labeling Huey Long as one of the two most dangerous men in America
    (the other being Douglas MacArthur!) The year 1935 brought the first
    of a series of Neutrality Acts. By 1936, even as Margaret Mitchell
    re-burned Atlanta, Hitler re-entered the Rhineland. War clouds were
    already showing on the horizon, and one had to consider the
    possibility of having to enter the service.</p>
  <p class="western">Facing up to all this was a pretty heavy load for
    the high school innocents of my day. Another element in the overall
    problem was the deteriorating family situation in my own home. This
    was brought into even sharper focus by the contrast I now witnessed
    between it and the Kirk home, where I was spending more and more
    time. When I beheld the warmth on the one hand at the Kirks, and the
    constant bickering at my home on the other, I at first suffered in
    silent bitterness, but soon I began feeling so cheated that I
    evinced open hostility. I would refuse to comply with the tradition
    of riding to and from church as part of the family unit. I just
    couldn&rsquo;t stand the constant nagging of my father by my mother.
    I&rsquo;d break away and go dashing up side streets to avoid the
    situation. Pop would drive the rest home and then begin cruising to
    intercept and pick me up as I tried to beat him back home. It really
    got to be ridiculous. I knew I had to get away &ndash; the sooner
    the better.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">As I cast about
    for opportunities, the first thing that caught my attention was the
    Civilian Conservation Corps &ndash; the CCC. It was set up on 31
    March 1933 and had 1300 camps established by mid-June, with over
    300,000 enrollees by August. One of the neighborhood boys got into
    it and came back with glory tales of freedom and independence. It
    ultimately included 2-and-1/2 million men and, among other things,
    planted some 17 million acres of forest (long since decimated by
    Weyerhauser, I&rsquo;m sure). It was administered by FDR crony Harry
    Hopkins (whom we&rsquo;ll meet again in Chapter <a href="#neighbor">VIII.
      NEIGHBOR</a>). This sickly looking administrator-extraordinary was
    dubbed by no less than Winston Churchill as &ldquo;Lord Root of the
    Matter&rdquo; for his legendary ability to get at the heart of
    problems. He once drew gallery applause while testifying before
    Congress by responding to a procrastinating Congressional budget
    cutter, &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t eat &lsquo;in the long run,&rsquo;
    Senator, they eat every day.&rdquo; Alas, I wouldn&rsquo;t qualify
    for this escape route until 1936, and it was also a little short on
    growth opportunity. It was our 20-volume set of the Book of
    Knowledge that presented another way out, and one that did offer a
    future &ndash; especially in view of the ever-increasing likelihood
    of war. Volume 1 provided an intriguing picture story anent the
    Naval Academy at Annapolis, and Volume 20 offered the same re the
    worldwide life of adventure available in the U.S. Navy. I was
    hooked!</p>

    1935 St Anthony&rsquo;s High School Graduating Class</h3>
  <p class="western">Now, beyond the aforementioned two articles (to
    which I had repeated recourse during my senior year as I built my
    fantasies anent my future), I knew absolutely nothing about the
    Naval Academy or the Navy. The only boat I&rsquo;d ever been on was
    the Annapolis-Claiborne-Matapeake Ferry en route to Ocean City. I
    had never known or even seen a naval officer or a sailor, at least
    not knowingly or up close. I did know that it would not only get me
    out of the home, but also out from under my mother&rsquo;s
    domination. It never entered my mind that I would have to handle
    guns, learn the manual of arms, learn the mechanics of marching and
    executing field maneuvers, go on parades, march to football games,
    do half-time card displays, row and sail boats (and maybe get
    sea-sick), tie knots, hose down decks, scrape paintwork, polish
    brass, submit to hazing, and turn weak-kneed the first time I heard
    the <i>Star Spangled Banner</i> in uniform. I saw only freedom from
    home, a prestigious career opportunity, and escape from the surely
    coming draft. Fortunately, Pop (who had already, via his friend, Fr.
    Beckley, registered me at Princeton) thought it was a great idea.
    The next thing I knew he had me set up for an academy prep school. I
    confess I never knew such existed. But I had to graduate first.</p>

    Now so mature!</h3>
  <p class="western">Kathleen and I graduated together from high
    school in early June of 1935. (Our senior class included a grand
    total of 10 girls and 8 boys!) Pop was our commencement speaker. He
    was a disaster. My brother, Tom, recalls it as &ldquo;the most
    agonizing commencement I ever attended.&rdquo; Pop&rsquo;s parents
    were there, and his sister, Sue, and of course he was terribly
    emotional about what he perceived as a major milestone and turning
    point in my life. Though an accomplished public speaker, he was so
    nervous that he almost went to pieces before our eyes. He fumbled
    for words, for which he was otherwise never at a loss. He referred
    to our <i>Benedictine</i> nun teachers as these wonderful nuns of
    <i>St. Dominic</i>. And that wasn&rsquo;t the end of it. The printed
    program even had his name wrong!</p>
  <p class="western">He and I laughingly recalled all this some 5
    years later when he descended upon the Naval Academy to lecture our
    first class one Friday night on International Law as it might soon
    confront us. We got together, on his insistence, the Sunday before
    he was to talk, and he asked me if I had any ideas on what he might
    best say and what he should not say. I had only two suggestions,
    with one example of each. He used them both, one to open with and
    one to close with, and they so got the class with him that it really
    didn&rsquo;t matter much what he said in between. He opened, after a
    very flattering and highly formal introduction by waving a finger in
    the air and announcing &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well, but it&rsquo;s
    Friday night and I know what the good word is!&rdquo; (At any given
    Friday night dinner: Upperclassman to plebe: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
    good word, mister?&rdquo; Plebe to upperclassman: &ldquo;Friday
    night, Sir, and another week shot in the ass!&rdquo; Forever after,
    my friend Whitehead never passed Pop on the grounds during a Sunday
    visit without their exchanging a raised waving finger and broad
    grins.</p>
  <p class="western">Pop closed by remarking that he hoped, if they
    didn&rsquo;t remember anything else, that everyone might recall that
    he was probably the first speaker they ever had (and correct he was,
    in my experience) who hadn&rsquo;t on having the microphone hung
    around his neck at the start said, &ldquo;Well, this is the first
    time I&rsquo;ve ever been decorated by the Navy,&rdquo; and he
    didn&rsquo;t (in so saying) touch it, which instantly set off a
    piercing electronic whistle. Immediately thereafter it was really a
    thrill to hear all my classmates exclaim as they left a Friday night
    lecture <i>laughing</i> for the first time in their lives &ldquo;Who
    <i>was</i> that guy? He really <i>did</i> have the word!&rdquo; And
    so on. Very few knew he was my father. Pop, of course, was simply
    delighted. He had finally had his redemption. Too bad Tom couldn&rsquo;t
    share in that.</p>
  <p class="western">But graduate we did, and in addition to Pop, we
    were later favored by a few words from FDR&rsquo;s wife, Eleanor. In
    those days it was her custom to invite all graduating Washington
    high school seniors to tea on a mid-June Saturday afternoon. This
    remains the only time I&rsquo;ve ever been in the White House. And
    lest we get too heady about all this, we have Samuel Eliot Morison
    to remind us: &ldquo;She [Eleanor Roosevelt] took a particular
    interest in the <i>disoriented</i> and <i>confused</i> young people
    then graduating&hellip;&rdquo; Well she might!</p>
  <p class="western">It was shortly thereafter, on 29 July 1935 to be
    precise, that Kathleen and I became engaged. We were both something
    less than 17-1/2 years old, and we knew we would have to wait <i>seven</i>
    years! (Actually, due to the war it turned out to be 7 years and 2
    months!) This came about in this way. Our days in school together,
    alas, were now over. There would be no more daily togetherness for a
    long, long time. (Until retirement on 31 March 1973, in fact, a
    period of some 38 years!) This being the case, some sort of
    commitment seemed indicated &ndash; especially as we both were
    certain by then as to how we hoped to spend the balance of our
    lives. It came about that we went to the movies this particular
    night together with my mother, father, and Pop&rsquo;s good friend,
    Fr. Beckley. We went to the old Colony theater then on Georgia
    Avenue just south of Piney Branch Road. The bill presented Pat
    O&rsquo;Brien in <i>Oil for the Lamps of China</i>. Kathleen wore a
    nice fitting one-piece medium blue dress with white polka dots about
    the size of peas. She really looked terrific.</p>

    First Ocean City sojourn together</h3>
  <p class="western">After the show we had to say a quick goodnight on
    her front porch while Mom and Pop and the good Father waited for me
    in the car at the curb. After a delicious lingering kiss, I remarked
    that I was getting awfully tired of these repeated goodbyes. She
    agreed. I said something to the effect that (and this was totally
    unplanned, or I&rsquo;d have chosen a much better time and place)
    &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we promise each other right now that as soon
    as we can do so (this being two years after graduation from the
    Naval Academy hopefully some 7 years hence), we&rsquo;ll take the
    necessary steps to keep us together always. Would you say yes to
    that?&rdquo; She simply said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo;
    I said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re officially engaged now.&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t
    remember that we ever told anybody about this until many years after
    we were married.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">The die was now
    cast for the Naval Academy as an essential element of my commitment.
    Though it was indeed my commitment, it was Pop who made it come
    true. This was, as regards Pop&rsquo;s contribution to my temporal
    life, his <i>shining hour</i>. If ever there was doubt that Pop was
    a good planner and organizer (and the insurance estate he did <i>not</i>
    provide for my mother occasioned considerable), his performance
    anent my entrance to the Naval Academy should dispel it for all
    time. I was, in respect to this prodigious undertaking, a total
    zero, without the slightest comprehension of what was required or
    how to go about it. And in those days it was a considerably more
    complex venture than it is today. There was a broad range of
    requirements involved: academic qualification, physical
    qualification, and political qualification. And in my case all three
    aspects entailed unique complications. For example, the political
    qualification involved the necessity of getting a political
    appointment. At that time one needed a congressional appointment,
    and the District of Columbia had no congressman. To make up for that
    deficiency, the rules theoretically took care of D.C. hopefuls by
    providing 25 Presidential appointments for them. However, these were
    by long custom reserved strictly for the sons of military officers
    on active duty in the District. In a word, I was shut out.</p>
  <p class="western">Not to worry, though, as the Rector of Catholic
    University was then a Bishop Ryan from Indiana. Pop engaged the good
    bishop&rsquo;s support in enlisting the interest of the first-term
    Indiana Congresswoman Virginia Jenckes in considering me for an
    appointment. Now, Virginia, though a freshman on the Hill, had
    secured the services of an old-time administrative assistant, a Mr.
    Cherniko, whose former patron had just failed at re-election. This
    oily rascal had to be the prototype of every political
    behind-the-scenes string-puller that you&rsquo;ve ever seen in the
    movies in your entire life. He was so shifty that I wouldn&rsquo;t
    have trusted him to park my car (and I didn&rsquo;t even have a
    car), and he would have been perfectly at home in Nixon&rsquo;s
    administration, I&rsquo;m sure. He dearly wanted Mrs. Jenckes to
    ingratiate herself to the good bishop &ndash; a matter of the
    Catholic vote, you see. At the same time, there was the little
    problem that I&rsquo;d never even been in Indiana (and didn&rsquo;t
    get there in fact until 1974, when I attended a Charismatic
    Convention at Notre Dame on behalf of Fr. Burke). There was also the
    problem of how to assuage any Indiana applicants should Mrs. Jenckes
    use one of her appointments for an out-of-stater. Mr. Cherniko got
    around these seeming difficulties very neatly. He arranged for me to
    get mail addressed to myself in Ft. Wayne to establish a basis re
    legal residence.</p>

    My mother (!) on the beach?</h3>
  <p class="western">The foregoing had two unique WWII consequences.
    Being listed in records as an Indiana appointee, I was singled out
    by a class of Indiana (Fort Wayne) school children as their WWII
    pen-pal. I sustained a correspondence with one of them for many
    years. The other thing was that both D.C. and Indiana provided
    veteran&rsquo;s bonuses after WWII. I was ineligible for the D.C.
    one and afraid to claim the one from Indiana. As to protecting Mrs.
    Jenckes from irate Indiana applicants, Mr. Cherniko merely arranged
    to have Mrs. Jenckes appoint me as a conditional <i>third</i>
    alternate. There were <i>no</i> principal, first, or second
    alternates! I told you he was smooth! And I had to write these two
    turkeys regularly to keep them informed of progress, and actually
    visit them whenever I was in town after finally gaining admission to
    the USNA. Another example of Mr. Cherniko&rsquo;s political genius
    (?) was that he arranged for Mrs. Jenckes to introduce a bill
    providing for the present practice of flying flags from all the
    government buildings in Washington. This turned out to be Mrs.
    Jenckes only claim to fame. She wasn&rsquo;t re-elected.</p>
  <p class="western">Then there was the physical qualification hassle.
    It was equally unbelievable. It all began with a preliminary
    physical exam at the Navy Department on Constitution Avenue (where I
    was later to work as a civilian from 1948 to 1965) on 8 August 1935.
    I failed the vision test, being 17/20 vs. 20/20 in the right eye due
    to hyperoptic astigmatism. It might be interesting to note that I
    was an even 6 ft. and weighed in at 155 lbs. Some two dozen years
    later, George was to weigh in for a preliminary exam at 150 lbs. I
    attribute the 5-lb. difference to my somewhat larger brain. My blood
    pressure was then (age 17) 134/90. Today (30 March 1983, age 65) it
    is 134/77! Of course, I&rsquo;m taking Inderal and Lanoxin, and have
    an almost new (June 1981) four-way bypass. Well, this little
    eye-opener called for a whole new ball game. I immediately was
    placed under the eye-care of a venerable old gentleman, a Dr.
    Muncaster, who was then reputedly the very best eye specialist in
    all DC. He was a sort of shrunken Sydney Greenstreet. His face would
    have passed for a twin, and the similarity of his deep, rumbling
    voice was remarkable. (I can almost hear him grumbling, &ldquo;Ah
    yes, Sir! Very troubling indeed, Sir! Ah yes.&rdquo;)</p>
  <p class="western">This old codger really knew his stuff, and his
    treatments were truly unique. He immediately set me up in a course
    of thrice-weekly visits. It might be more accurate to term them
    sessions, because I spent at least half a day in his office each
    trip. He would test me, dilate my eyes, then test me again. Then I&rsquo;d
    have to sit at a table for half an hour, holding an eye-cup to my
    open right eye-ball. The cup was connected to a reinforced plastic
    hose, connected in turn to the suction side of small air compressor.
    The compressor was secured to a rough-cut, unpainted board which
    also bore an assortment of automatic valving. This rig and process
    was all the good doctor&rsquo;s own invention. The compressor and
    valving were so arranged that for one-half hour the little
    compressor would gently pull my right eyeball somewhat out of its
    socket and then quickly release it, over and over again. The
    objective was (working on Pascal&rsquo;s law of the equality of
    distribution of fluid pressures) to restore the spherical perfection
    of the eyeball lens. Astigmatism, you see, is merely the result of a
    flat on this spherical surface which distorts the image accordingly.
    Following this, the doctor would retest my vision, undilate my eyes
    (requiring some 30 minutes&rsquo; wait), and then retest them again.
    This went on all through August and well into the September start of
    prep school (about which more below).</p>
  <p class="western">There was just one other thing. In between visits
    during this period, which was the better part of the entire summer,
    I was not to use my eyes at all. Except when maneuvering to and from
    somewhere, and I mean actually personally in motion, I sat with my
    eyes covered by aviator goggles, the glasses of which had not only
    been painted over in black paint on both sides, but which were then
    taped over with black tar&ndash;tape! I was supposed to keep my eyes
    open and focused on infinity. I listened to a lot of music that
    summer. By the end of it, I could read 20/20 in Dr. Muncaster&rsquo;s
    office with ease!</p>
  <p class="western">But then, as hinted above, there was prep school.
    I was enrolled in Columbian Preparatory School, then located on
    Rhode Island Avenue, N.W., just past 14th Street heading into town.
    It was essentially a boarding school, embracing a row of three or
    four converted red brick houses of some four stories each. The
    four-man teaching staff also lived in. This school ran from
    mid-September to early April, and concentrated on preparing for
    Naval Academy and Military Academy entrance exams. Tuition was $900,
    which in 1935 was a really substantial sum. (Remember, a new Chevy
    cost $565!) They wasted no time on athletics. They didn&rsquo;t even
    waste time on students they thought couldn&rsquo;t make it. If a guy
    didn&rsquo;t seem to have it &ndash; or even if it only seemed he
    wasn&rsquo;t giving his all &ndash; he was gone! This was a
    no-nonsense staff of academic specialists with the disciplinary
    demeanor of Marine Corps drill sergeants. This was really the big
    leagues, and for me it was a helluva transition &ndash; but a
    necessary and profitable one. They taught me my English grammar, at
    last. They instilled all my good study habits. They insisted on and
    got everyone&rsquo;s best shot.</p>
  <p class="western">The principal was a Mr. Puhl, a huge man with a
    booming voice and a ferocious temper. He was the first and only
    person I ever saw who literally did actually get purple with rage,
    working himself into such a frenzy that he&rsquo;d go into a gasping
    coughing fit and had to start popping some pills he always had ready
    for such emergencies. He was head disciplinarian, and his word was
    law. He was unusually feared because he&rsquo;d only have to mumble
    &ldquo;You&rsquo;re out&rdquo; and you were! I saw it happen more
    than once. (&ldquo;Mr. Langlois, you&rsquo;re wasting your father&rsquo;s
    money and my time. Get your gear together and get out!&rdquo;) He
    taught algebra and geometry. The history teacher was Professor
    Goolsby. His younger brother was in my class and he gave him
    constant hell, perhaps to prove he played no favorites. He, too, was
    frightening. He taught both ancient and U.S. history. When it came
    to ancient history, with all the multiple-syllable Greek names with
    arcane pronunciation, he&rsquo;d simply stipulate: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
    not teaching Greek or pronunciation here, we&rsquo;re teaching
    history, and the only correct pronunciation is <i>my</i>
    pronunciation.&rdquo; And so it was.</p>
  <p class="western">Goolsby&rsquo;s stock in trade was the 3-by-5
    index card. I had a whole 12-inch-long file box full on ancient
    history by the time the course ended seven months later. A typical
    card might specify: &ldquo;Ammonhotep IV &ndash; also known as
    Iknaton &ndash; built the Karnak at Thebes.&rdquo; (My recall 49
    years later sure proves his system worked!) There was a drug store
    on the corner at 14th and Rhode Island Avenue then, with my bus stop
    opposite. (I was one of some three or four day students out of
    perhaps 100, split in half according to whether headed for USNA or
    USMA.) Woe unto you if Mr. Goolsby should chance to walk to the drug
    store and see you at the bus stop and <i>not</i> studying your
    cards. This was the idea. You were always to carry a pocketful, and
    study them at each and every idle moment. Another teacher was Mr.
    Hildreth, with whom, perhaps because he was much younger than the
    rest, you might risk a casual friendly greeting.</p>
  <p class="western">Beginning with the first Saturday morning of the
    school session (yes, we attended on Saturday, too) we took a
    regular, formal, full-scale USNA entrance exam for algebra under
    strict USNA conditions. These were three-hour exams! They weren&rsquo;t
    your usual high school&ndash;level algebra, either. I remember
    especially being troubled by problems of one rabbit overtaking
    another, and of the precise angles of clock hands at two different
    times. This was excellent training. I remember there were several
    zeros the first Saturday, and I doubt if anyone got over 30. As the
    weeks went on, it was heartening to watch your score crawling ever
    upward. By the end, everyone was hitting 100 pretty regularly. This
    was a real confidence builder. Anyone who didn&rsquo;t show progress
    in every subject regularly would be singled out in class for
    individual public harassment by Mr. Puhl. This usually entailed his
    working up to a purple-faced coughing fit, and on occasion concluded
    with a &ldquo;You&rsquo;re out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Little wonder that I studied from the moment I
    got home until dinner, and from dinner &rsquo;til often as late as 3
    AM. I&rsquo;d have done anything to avoid being harangued &ndash; or
    worse yet, terminated &ndash; by Mr. Puhl. I worked my fanny off. I
    never stopped studying except for brief tension-breaking runs around
    the block. My brother Tom recalls: &ldquo;I remember sitting in the
    living room with Mom (Pop was usually reading or studying in the
    back room), and we&rsquo;d hear this crash upstairs like the sound
    of a chair being overturned. Your bedroom door would bam open, then
    you&rsquo;d bound down the stairs, run through the living room and
    out the front door. I&rsquo;d look out the window and you&rsquo;d be
    racing up and down the street.&rdquo; He says he could also remember
    me imitating Mr. Puhl: &ldquo;Boys, have you got your cards? Where
    are your cards? Get out your cards!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">The English teacher was Mr. Pratt. (When he
    eventually inherited the headship of the school, he changed its name
    to <i>his</i> name). He was a wiry little man, with a thin, raspy,
    nasal voice and absolutely NO sense of humor. His manner was as dull
    as a brand new Gillette razor blade, but you couldn&rsquo;t let your
    attention lag for a second, because his output was 100% meat. Like
    his taut lean body, his pitches contained absolutely no fat. He
    concentrated his words in short, penetrating, staccato bursts, much
    as a machine gunner might spray his opposition with
    scarcely-more-lethal lead in a style later to be popularized by
    David Brinkley. He had a fetish for precision of expression. Like so
    many small men, he was veritable martinet and, in oral or written
    exchanges with him, every little soldier in your array of syntax had
    to line up like a drill team parading for the queen.</p>
  <p class="western">Anne recalls a relevant childhood dinner table
    tableau which was a riddle to her then, but is beginning to make
    sense now that she is parsing legal speak. She remembers when I&rsquo;d
    have the teapot by my place at dinner, and when Kathleen would ask,
    &ldquo;Would you pour me some tea, dear?&rdquo; I&rsquo;d reply,
    &ldquo;Yes, dear&rdquo; &ndash; only I wouldn&rsquo;t. Then Kathleen
    would say, &ldquo;Will you pour me a little tea <i>now</i>, dear?&rdquo;
    Then I would pour her about a tablespoonful of tea. Anne confesses,
    &ldquo;It was a game to you guys, but let me tell you, that really
    taught me to appreciate language.&rdquo; So, both she and I owe a
    note of thanks to my surly English teacher at Columbian Prep, with
    an assist from Pop&rsquo;s friend, Mr. Barnum. Pop used to tell of
    the time when he was young and one day Mr. Barnum asked, Would you
    like to go to the circus, Herb? Pop coyly replied, &ldquo;Well, I
    don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Barnum.&rdquo; Mr. Barnum shot back, &ldquo;Then
    I&rsquo;ll find somebody who does!&rdquo; This, Pop allowed, taught
    him never to equivocate or play linguistic games.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, the day finally came in April when the
    actual USNA entrance exams were held. They were conducted somewhere
    downtown under government auspices, on three consecutive days, with
    one three-hour test each AM and PM. It was 14 July 1936 before we
    got the results. Mine were: Geometry 3.7, Algebra 3.7, English 2.7
    (remember my problem with Edmund Burke?), U.S. History 3.2, Ancient
    History 3.7, and Physics 3.2. (I set these marks down here with some
    elation, since they were undoubtedly the highest marks I was ever to
    attain in connection with the Academy.) Meanwhile, on 14 April 1936,
    I failed a special preliminary eye re-exam at the USNA itself. The
    test, unfortunately, came about immediately upon the heels of the
    three days of exams and the eye-straining study leading up thereto.
    Nevertheless, I was authorized to report on 22 June 1936, at which
    time a final eye exam would be administered. So, it was back once
    again to the Dr. Muncaster routine. I have no idea what this
    specialist&rsquo;s treatment cost my father, but it must have been a
    bundle. To make a long story short, I failed again on 22 June, to
    the great consternation of Dr. Muncaster, who had witnessed me pass
    the test repeatedly in the week before reporting to the USNA.

    Awaiting USNA acceptance</h3>
  <p class="western">Well, Pop got busy again. After all, he had made
    some great naval contacts as editor of the Naval Conference in
    London in 1931. So, a second final exam was arranged for USNA on 7
    July 1936, and the Muncaster routine continued. (I <i>saw</i>
    nothing at <i>all</i> in the summers of 1935 and 1936. I might as
    well have been at the center of the Earth, except that, as I&rsquo;ve
    said before, I sure did become familiar with a lot of great music.
    All I would do was lie around and listen.) Would you believe it? I
    failed the second final test on 7 July 1936. Somehow Pop then
    wrangled a super-special final-final exam by the Surgeon General
    himself for 6 August 1936. I passed this test and was finally
    admitted to the Naval Academy on 10 August 1936. I never failed
    another eye test in all my 12 years in the Navy.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">You might well
    ask, &ldquo;So what happened to Kathleen during the aforementioned
    testing period?&rdquo; Well, believe me, it was testing for her,
    too. She was then working for the government by day and going to
    Dunbarton College by night to work on her college degree. In
    between, she&rsquo;d manage to meet me most weekdays for maybe a
    half-hour at the balcony lounge of the downtown Woodward and
    Lothrop. I got out of school around 3 PM, proceeded to Woody&rsquo;s,
    where she&rsquo;d join me for our brief daily visits about 4:45,
    then she&rsquo;d be off to college and I&rsquo;d go home to study
    &rsquo;til 3 AM. The half-hour together was, of course, in crowded
    public conditions, but at least we still got to see each other
    fairly regularly, and that helped make it tolerable. It reminded us
    of what we were sacrificing and working for together. And no time
    was wasted. I always had cards to study while waiting for her, and,
    of course, for whenever I was riding on or waiting for public
    transportation. It was a very busy time for both of us, which
    probably helped a great deal.</p>
  <p class="western">Speaking of busy, how about my Pop! In the period
    of June 1935 to August 1936 he engineered me an appointment from the
    state of Indiana, determined upon and negotiated my admittance to a
    rather exclusive prep school, contrived a whole series of critical
    eye re-exams culminating with one by the Surgeon General, and
    secured the services of the most innovative eye specialist in the
    Washington Metropolitan Area &ndash; if not on the entire East
    Coast. While some of these efforts must have required some
    considerable outlays of dollars, without exception they all
    compelled extraordinary outlays of his valuable time. You might have
    thought he&rsquo;d have time for nothing else during this period.
    You&rsquo;d be wrong! In addition to carrying his full load of
    college-level and postgraduate courses and seminars, he wrote the
    foreword to a book on foreign policy in the Far East, had extensive
    letters-to-the-editor on freedom of the seas and the League of
    Nations published in the <i>Washington Star</i> and the <i>Post</i>,
    prepared two reports of proceedings for the Committee on
    Publications of the Department of State and one report on the
    proceedings of the Special Committee on Documentation of the
    Pan-American Conference, published three magazine articles on the
    World Court, Embargo Plans, and the Pittman Bill (dealing with
    presidential powers), edited a book celebrating the Sesquicentennial
    of the Treaty of 1783 re Franco-American cooperation, and published
    two newspaper articles re limitation on the size of the Army and the
    resolution of Greek debts. I don&rsquo;t know <i>when</i> he slept.
    So, let this be my acknowledgment of his planning and organizational
    genius as contributing to my successful career, and consequently to
    our secure family life. This is where and how it all began. And my
    mother sensed it immediately. At my elation on telling her I&rsquo;d
    actually passed the academic exams, she soberly replied, &ldquo;Now,
    you&rsquo;ll be leaving me never to return.&rdquo; She was right, of
    course, but the finality and irreversible aspect of it all had never
    entered my head. All in all, this period marked more than merely a
    change from the carefree days of high school. Now Kathleen and I
    both shared a common objective and delighted in working together
    toward it. I could vibrate in perfect harmony to the words of
    Meriwether Lewis at the midpoint (18 August 1805) of his northwest
    passage on the occasion of his 31st birthday:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I reflected that I had as yet done very
    little, very little, indeed, to further the happiness of the human
    race, or to advance the information of the succeeding generation. I
    viewed with regret the many hours I had spent in indolence, and now
    sorely felt the want of that information which those idle hours
    would have given me had they been judiciously expended. But since
    they are past and cannot be recalled, I dash from me the gloomy
    thought, and resolve in future, to redouble my exertions &hellip; or
    in future, to live for mankind, as I have heretofore lived for
    myself.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, I most certainly did regret my somewhat
    squandered high school years, and I did renew my resolve to always
    give full attention to the matter at hand in the future &ndash; to
    make every minute count. But, of course, I even then stopped short
    of vowing to live for humankind. I was, however, now fully committed
    to others, and it was just that I was at that time quite content to
    limit this future commitment to Kathleen and our hoped-for family!</p>

  <p class="chapter-quote-western">It is not book learning young men
    need, nor instruction in this or that, but a stiffening of the
    vertebrae which will cause them to be loyal to a trust, to act
    promptly, to concentrate their energies, do a thing!<span style="font-style: normal">
	&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Elbert&nbsp;Hubbard</span></p>
  <p class="western">I left home for good on 10 Aug 1936. I was almost
    eighteen-and-a-half years old. I hadn&rsquo;t the slightest idea
    what lay ahead. I only knew that I had a life objective and that my
    journey had begun. I had no fear and no regrets. It was all to be a
    great adventure. So, I set out for the Naval Academy, my father
    driving me to Annapolis, just as I was to drive our son, George,
    some 26 years later.</p>
  <p class="western">Geographically, the Naval Academy was only about
    30 miles from my parents&rsquo; home. Psychologically, it was some
    several light years removed. One small step for the boy; one giant
    leap into manhood. The umbilical cord was severed; the apron strings
    were forevermore beyond reach. Ironically, it was in totally
    surrendering my personal freedom to a nebulous but omniscient
    authority that, for the first time in my life, I felt really free.
    It felt great!</p>
  <p class="western">We stopped for a quick if late breakfast at a
    dingy little eating emporium on Maryland Avenue, just a block or two
    from the Academy&rsquo;s main gate. I was soon to learn that this
    was the original <i>Greasy Spoon</i>, a favorite hangout at which
    Kathleen and I would share many a meal &ndash; my favorite being a
    simultaneous serving of a grilled cheese sandwich and a chocolate
    sundae. Fabulous! But, I couldn&rsquo;t eat that day. Too excited. I
    wanted to get on with it, step over the threshold and slam the door.
    I was eager to stride into my future, shedding the past like an
    unwanted cloak without so much as a glance over my shoulder. So,
    through the gate we went.</p>
  <p class="western">My separation from my father was quick and
    immediate. I was swept away with a motley group of fellow candidates
    by a brisk, well-tanned, blazingly white&ndash;uniformed second
    classman named Muddy Waters, who immediately gave me favorable
    personal attention on noting that I, like he, had been appointed
    from the state of Indiana. This was perhaps my last lucky break
    while at the Academy. The first thing I remember was the Marine
    haircut which left no sideburns and no hair more than 3/8 of an inch
    long. We were then hustled off to the midshipmen&rsquo;s store,
    where talented clerks sized us up in a twinkling of an eye and
    tossed all manner of virtually perfectly fitting uniforms, plus
    equipment and books, into a huge cardboard box with which each plebe
    had been provided. There was a break in the routine as we were all
    assembled in Memorial Hall underneath Admiral Lawrence&rsquo;s
    famous flag &ndash; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Give Up The Ship&rdquo; &ndash;
    to be sworn in as midshipmen. (I must state that if the ill-fated
    skipper of the Pueblo had shared this experience, then I feel
    certain he could never have acted as he did.)</p>

    Plebe year</h3>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, we were all lined up smartly (well, as
    much as raw recruits could be), and our parents lined the walls all
    around us. The oath was administered by Cdr. Walter S. Delaney, USN,
    (who, during WWII as a Vice Admiral in Pac Flt officially commended
    me for an outstandingly performing engineering department in the
    heavy cruiser U.S.S. Bremerton). It was a very solemn moment. I
    especially remember Cdr. Delaney&rsquo;s emphasis on the fact that
    (as I&rsquo;ve mentioned previously) we would thenceforth, unlike
    West Pointers who were merely cadets in the Corps, be midshipmen <i>in
      the U.S. Navy</i>! As I&rsquo;ve indicated elsewhere, this would be
    a matter of no small significance when I retired from government
    service some 38 years later at the age of 55. My four years at the
    Naval Academy would count in the calculation of retirement benefits.
    It was many years later before the same benefit accrued to West
    Point graduates. (Well, so I had at least this second lucky break!)</p>
  <p class="western">At any rate, I was now officially a plebe.
    Webster defines plebe as &ldquo;a freshman at the Naval Academy or
    Military Academy.&rdquo; Seventeenth century England defined plebe
    as &ldquo;commonplace, undistinguished, base, ignoble.&rdquo; The
    1898 <i>Lucky Bag</i> (the USNA yearbook) defines plebe as &ldquo;that
    insignificant being, the Fourth classman.&rdquo; The 1982 <i>Reef
      Points</i> (the annual plebe handbook) defines plebe as &ldquo;that
    insignificant thing that gets all the sympathy and chow from home.&rdquo;
    As a 1983 Alumni Bulletin states, &ldquo;Whichever definition one
    chooses, there is a constant: the plebe is at the bottom rung of the
    ladder.&rdquo; It goes on, &ldquo;Plebe year has been, is, and will
    continue to be tough. It is designed to teach discipline, duty, and
    accountability as well as give each plebe an understanding of the
    history and traditions of the naval service.&rdquo; But there are
    potential compensations for the roughness of plebe year. The
    bulletin continues, &ldquo;The class of 1987 can expect to claim
    among its members some 30 flag officers&hellip; One may become the
    Chief of Naval Operations or Commandant of the Marine Corps. On the
    other hand, a number will [by that time, circa 2017] have given
    their lives in the service of their country.&rdquo; This, then, is
    the new plebe&rsquo;s prospectus.</p>
  <p class="western">After the swearing-in, there was a brief reunion
    with parents for congratulations and final goodbyes. I may have
    already cut the umbilical cord from Mom, but Pop still retained a
    firm hand on the tiller. It turned out that during our brief
    separation he had engineered a deal to arrange a roommate for me.
    This was something that I confess had not even entered my mind, but
    it had occurred to Pop. During the haircutting and fitting-out, he
    had met a fine gentleman from Richmond, Virginia, and they instantly
    took a great liking to each other. They thereupon determined that if
    we hadn&rsquo;t already made some commitment, then their sons should
    be roommates. And so it was to be, and this was lucky break #3, and
    I&rsquo;m going to stop counting right here. Well, not quite,
    because it turned out that this roommate of mine had a brother who
    was a first classman! This turned out to work to our salvation on
    the dreaded Hell Night (the night before graduation), about which
    more later. This, then, will be my last recorded lucky break.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">Almost
    immediately after this brief respite, my new roommate, Abbot Prince
    Street (of Trelawney, BonAire, Virginia, with a private island
    summer home, complete with two Buicks and a sailboat on the York
    River) and I were assigned to a room on the inboard side of the 4th
    deck of the second battalion (eastmost) wing of Bancroft Hall. There
    we set about stenciling and properly folding and storing all our new
    uniforms and gear, which took several hours. Shortly before evening
    meal formation, we ventured out of our room alone to check out the
    view from the seaward terrace, which in fact was the level,
    red-bricked top of the ground-level dining hall that runs northeast
    to southwest at the back (southeast side) of the first and third
    battalion wings, which than constituted the front of Bancroft Hall.
    We were soon accosted by an officer trailed by an arm-banded,
    clipboard-carrying midshipman. We snapped-to in our best estimate of
    attention, but in our panic we failed to salute LCdr. Padgett
    (affectionately known as Flangehead for his wide-jutting ears), the
    <i>Officer of the Watch</i>. So it was that my roommate and I ended
    up on report before our first day in the Navy had come to a close.
    So much, indeed, for lucky breaks!</p>

    Johnny Refo &ndash; Dave Davenport &ndash; Abbot Street, my roommate</h3>
  <p class="western">In no time at all, we were completely into a full
    and rigorous daily routine of plebe summer drills and lectures.
    Unlike most plebes, I had to start from scratch in learning the
    manual of arms, close order drill (where one paced out squad
    maneuvers by following painted footprints on the sands of time on
    the concrete area then abutting Thompson Stadium, but which is now
    the Field House). We were instructed in the disassembly of pistol
    and rifle, were introduced to the rifle range (with attendant black
    eyes from improperly restrained Springfield rifle recoil), tried to
    fire pistols surreptitiously from the hip, and labored in the butts.
    (Would you believe that I was so disenchanted with firearms that I
    always volunteered for the butts &ndash; spotting targets and scores
    &ndash; and haven&rsquo;t ever even fired a pistol to this day?) We
    all had to qualify at least as marksmen with the rifle.</p>

    Halfraters</h3>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">Then there were
    the small boats. We drilled in raising and lowering cutters, and in
    rowing them, as we concurrently learned and interpreted blinker and
    signal flag orders so as to maneuver them in lines and columns, etc.
    We also were introduced to the art of sailing in sloop-rigged
    halfraters. Then there were drills in &ldquo;tails,&rdquo; which is
    in nautical knot tying &ndash; where I won a plaudit from a crusty
    old bosun as he screamed, &ldquo;Mister, who in hell ties your shoes
    for you when you get up in the morning?&rdquo; (I told you my luck
    had turned.) We even had drills in marching into and out of the
    stadium for football games, and in doing the card tricks for the
    half-time shows, and we had after-dinner sessions in Smoke Hall to
    learn all the Navy songs. (This musical indoctrination carried over
    into gangs around a guitar-strumming barracks song balladeer from
    whom we learned <i>The Minstrel Sings of an English King of a
      Thousand Years Ago</i>, etc.) Finally, who can ever forget the
    recurring litany of &ldquo;Gentlemen, this is a 5&quot; gun. The
    trainer sits on the right, the pointer sits on the left.&rdquo; (Or
    was it the other way around?)</p>
  <p class="western">The indoctrination came thick and fast, and it
    was total. They held preliminary math drills in what was termed
    mensuration, where you performed every conceivable conversion of
    mathematical and physical units from one system to another.

    The disk is up! The disk is down! Ready on the firing line!</h3>
  <p class="western">You got lectures on Navy customs, tradition, and
    etiquette. You also had to join some formal church party (Catholics
    were then marched on Sundays to St. Mary&rsquo;s in Annapolis before
    regimental reveille), or you had to attend Chapel. My alarm failed
    once, so I missed Mass and was given extra duty &ndash; which
    consisted of walking a Springfield for several hours when I could
    have been resting. Thus, my picture was taken for inclusion in the
    book <i>The Naval Academy Today</i>. I thought that was neat. My
    mother was not amused. Then there was the bilge one had to commit to
    memory to avoid more severe hazing. The bible for this was the
    annual edition of <i>Reef Points</i> &ndash; a compendium of naval
    historical lore (covering monuments as well as heroes and events),
    and all manner of naval trivia. The correct reply to &ldquo;What
    time is it, Mister?&rdquo; was at least a half-page of convoluted
    double-talk. The answer to &ldquo;How long is a Chinaman?&rdquo; is
    &ldquo;Yes, Sir!&rdquo; (<i>You</i> figure it out!)</p>

    From the book <i>Annapolis Today</i> &ndash; Look who&rsquo;s
    walking extra duty</h3>
  <p class="western">You also had to commit to memory the day&rsquo;s
    menus, the movies playing in town and the show times (the current
    hit was the debut of <i>Gone With the Wind</i>), and the <i>Washington
      Post</i> news and sports headlines. You also had to be able to
    discourse on the daily Mary Haworth column (she was the forerunner
    of &ldquo;Dear Abby&rdquo;). Sometimes you had to write her a letter
    sufficiently clever as to go undetected as a fraud and therefore to
    be published. Then, for each Sunday dinner hour, you had to have a
    specially prepared Happy Hour presentation. If it was good enough,
    you got to sit down (braced up, of course) for evening meal.
    Otherwise you ate squatting on your haunches, with your thighs level
    and no butt resting on your heels.</p>
  <p class="western">I don&rsquo;t think I ever sat down to a plebe
    year dinner except on Saturday, when most of the upper class ate out
    in town. I still remember one skit following first classman
    Gilkeson&rsquo;s sojourn in the <i>Reina Mercede</i>s (the then
    equivalent of the brig) which went to the tune of <i>Miss Otis
      Regrets</i>, thus: &ldquo;Mr. Gilkeson regrets he&rsquo;s unable to
    dine tonight, yes sir. Mr. Gilkeson regrets he&rsquo;s unable to
    dine tonight. Because the other night he snook, into the bat house
    and fixed up a muster book. Yes, sir. Mr. Gilkeson regrets he&rsquo;s
    unable to dine tonight.&rdquo; We got to sit down. Another highlight
    of this period was our participation as extras in the movie <i>Navy
      Blue and Gold,</i> featuring Robert Young and Lionel Barrymore.</p>
  <p class="western">Every plebe is assigned, as sort of a valet and
    legman, to some first classman. Some first classmen treated their
    plebes as serfs or less. Some were quite decent and even protected
    their plebes like a mother hen. My first classmen were as curious a
    pair of forced roommates as you&rsquo;ll ever find. One, Richard
    Halla, went on to become 1st and 3rd set regimental commander and a
    Rhodes Scholar. The roommate who was inflicted on him was one John
    Gerald Sullivan, as mean and devious a shanty Irishman as you&rsquo;re
    ever likely to meet. (My fanny should still show scars from his
    well-snapped toothbrush handle or steel ruler.) Halla was a real
    egghead and a basically very nice guy, but inclined to almost
    Victorian stuffiness. I was never comfortable with him, and guess I
    really just didn&rsquo;t like him. Sullivan, on the other hand, was
    so jauntily and fearlessly antiestablishment, so totally wild and
    unpredictable, that you just couldn&rsquo;t help shaking your head
    in a sort of reluctant admiration, even though he would rank high
    among &ldquo;SOBs I have known.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">For example, for a time I was seated at the 1/c
    end of a mess hall table headed by Sully. He too often required that
    I slip under the table and wriggle my way stealthily through a
    quagmire of intervening legs and feet to the 2/c end of the table,
    there to deposit pads of butter on the slickly shined toes of their
    shoes. To be discovered en route either way was to raise the alarm
    of &ldquo;Fire in the paint locker!&rdquo; whereupon every
    midshipman at the table would hastily toss a glass of the most
    available fluid &ndash; usually milk, tomato juice, or hot coffee &ndash;
    on the helpless culprit caught beneath the table. But even to
    execute the maneuver without detection was to no avail, since Sully
    would have to gloatingly shout, &ldquo;Hey Eric! Look at your
    shoes!&rdquo; This would occasion a come-around from every second
    classman at the table for a particularly vicious ass whaling, since
    butter destroyed the shine of the shoes for good.</p>
  <p class="western">In all events, Sully was kicked out a month
    before graduation. He probably should have been &ndash; for many
    things they never discovered, and because he&rsquo;d probably have
    been a terrible excuse for a naval officer. However, he was in the
    case on record, I believe, virtually framed. My father interceded on
    his behalf (at my instigation) to the maximum practical extent, but
    to no avail. I still think of him anytime I hear that old song, <i>The
      One Rose</i>. (Does anyone remember Gordon Hittenmark&rsquo;s
    morning show on WRC radio? He catered to awakening midshipmen. Sully
    required that I write him almost daily requesting <i>The One Rose</i>
    at reveille each day.)</p>
  <p class="western">The foregoing pretty well reflects the
    nitty-gritty doings of my plebe year. Athletically, I was a
    wash-out, at a mere 165 pounds, except that I won class numerals as
    a pitcher in our intramural baseball league.</p>

    Dave Davenport, Abbot Street, and Frank Hertel</h3>
  <p class="western">I was a submarine hurler in the manner of
    then&ndash;Washington Senators&rsquo; pitcher Dolph Liska. (Rough
    academic going precluded further baseball until my first class year,
    when I actually made the varsity under Coach Max Bishop, the former
    second baseman of Connie Mack&rsquo;s legendary Philadelphia teams &ndash;
    with the likes of Lefty Grove, Mickey Cochrane, and Jimmy Foxx.) In
    the academic realm, I didn&rsquo;t fare much better, as I barely
    held my nose above the waterline, and didn&rsquo;t really excel in
    anything. But none of this really tells you very much of what plebe
    year really meant to me. The going will get a little heavy here, and
    I can only promise that I&rsquo;ll do the best I can. My life was
    completely changed. Heretofore I&rsquo;d been the most sheltered of
    all the well-sheltered. Now I was really lying bare to the wolves,
    and &ndash; to my utter amazement &ndash; there <i>were</i> wolves.
    I had come fresh out of a strictly middle-class Catholic-home,
    Catholic-school, Catholic-community environment. Now, I wasn&rsquo;t
    a complete prude, and I knew all the four-letter words myself and
    was, so to say, on a speaking relationship with many of them. But I
    was fairly well shocked by some of the rank obscenity, low-level
    ethics, and often even disgusting manners and mores of this huge
    conglomerate of which I had innocently become a part. (I don&rsquo;t
    think such wide disparities in values endure anywhere in the world
    today!) One result of this unexpected encounter with really trashy
    conduct was that I never tended to mix or to be assimilated into my
    class. I remained a cautious loner, and made virtually no new
    friends. On the other hand, there were (to my then-young mind) some
    very positive aspects of what I can only label the U.S. Navy
    mystique. First of all, to me, there really was something special
    about a Navy uniform. Lawrence of Arabia once said something to the
    point:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">It came upon me freshly how the secret of
    the uniform was to make a crowd solid, dignified, impersonal: to
    give it the singleness and tautness of an upstanding man. This
    death&rsquo;s livery which walled its bearers from ordinary life,
    was a sign that they had sold their wills and bodies to the State:
    and contracted themselves into a service not the less abject for
    that its beginning was voluntary.</p>
  <p class="western">Wow! That is largely true. I can still vaguely
    sense the surge of enthusiasm and pride that engulfed me when I
    first stood at attention, in dress uniform, facing the flag, as the
    band blared out our National Anthem. You <i>knew</i> you were part
    of something big and important. But leave it to Eric Sevareid to put
    it all in more appropriate perspective:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">When marching at the flank of a column on
    inspection parade, I had a thrilling feeling of being a part of a
    living, invisible force; but this was a fleeting sensation, despised
    later as part of the seductive paraphernalia of the plot, along with
    the flag and music and shining brass, to lure us into feeling that
    the training for murder was really something else.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, Eric goes a little too far for my taste,
    but he is on the mark to the extent that he impels a more balanced
    view of military trappings. &ldquo;Murder,&rdquo; I believe, is an
    injudicious choice of words, but we must never forget that indeed
    the business of the military is <i>destruction</i>, however much we
    may opt to euphemize it as defense of self or country. Nevertheless,
    it seems to me, the military trappings are a significant &ndash; if
    not essential &ndash; element in the evolution of a cohesive
    fighting-unit <i>esprit</i>. Here I refer mostly to the bands, the
    medals, the flags, the parades, etc. The uniform, of course, is part
    of it all, too, but it is of even more significance. It provides
    instant recognition of friend or foe and connotes varying ranges of
    special qualifications and capabilities, plus it communicates an
    indication of seniority and rank for purpose of discipline and
    leadership. Beyond that, some further special markings often suggest
    a unique level of achievement &ndash; and consequent pride &ndash;
    with respect to certain specific units possessed of a glorious
    history.</p>

    Illegal rest</h3>
  <p class="western">It remains now only to consider the relevance of
    hazing to the military indoctrination process. Of course no one in
    authority admits hazing exists. It&rsquo;s interesting to note that
    as recently as September 1983 a leading news magazine reported,
    &ldquo;Most tough physical hazing of first-year classes has been
    eliminated [at service academies], partly because about 1/10th of
    the students are women, and partly because concerned faculty members
    decided the old system was counter-productive.&rdquo; The
    Superintendent at West Point remarked that, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
    hazing <i>is gone</i> [emphasis added], and it was a mistake.&rdquo;
    It&rsquo;s perhaps even more interesting that, further along in the
    same article, there are student references to harassment by
    upperclassmen, and pushiness of upperclassmen, some of whom go power
    crazy. You pay your money and take your choice as to who is correct.
    This is the stickiest wicket of them all, and frankly, I&rsquo;ve
    never read a cogent argument for it. There are, on the other hand,
    lots of ready arguments against hazing. One is that the time spent
    hereon might surely be better spent on more positive pursuits.
    Another is that sadists <i>do</i> exist. Still another is that much
    of it is irrelevant trivia or so-called Mickey-Mouse claptrap. In
    all my military reading (which has been quite extensive) only
    General Omar Bradley ever ventured a published opinion, to wit:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The hazing, so often criticized, had
    several positive by-products. It was a great leveler. There were
    among us many pampered boys, campus heroes and heartthrobs, prep
    school snobs, and even a few bullies. Hazing knocked the wind out of
    their sails in a hurry. It impressed upon us the sense of rank and
    privilege and taught us to unquestioningly and quickly obey orders,
    fundamental grounding for any soldier.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, now, Omar! Badges of rank, too, are a great
    leveler, reference to pampered boys suggests sour grapes even as
    reference to campus heroes and heartthrobs suggests envy. As for the
    bullies, they always lie low until they become upperclassmen, at
    which point they become the most abusive hazers. As for
    unquestioningly obeying orders, I&rsquo;d hoped that Hitler had
    forever put that one to rest. I would be inclined to give Omar the
    benefit of the doubt, and postulate that he instinctively realized
    through his vast leadership experience that hazing provided an
    eventual net plus. Still, his analysis was faulty in ascribing his
    reasons for that gut feeling. Easy for you to say, you might opine
    (especially since, as a varsity football player, he was undoubtedly
    spared any serious hazing himself), so I had best try to make <i>my</i>
    case.</p>
  <p class="western">On balance, I, too, feel that hazing added up to
    a net plus. First, I can attest that there have been frequent
    instances in my life where I could confidently face a really lousy
    situation by confiding to myself that &ldquo;If you could survive
    plebe year, this should be a piece of cake!&rdquo; Second, learning
    to accommodate to around-the-clock harassment isn&rsquo;t the worst
    preparation for a combat environment or internment (short of actual
    physical torture, of course) as a prisoner of war. Third, nothing so
    quickly and indelibly impressed upon me the fundamental and
    important truth that military duty is indeed a commitment entailing
    total surrender of self to the dictates of any and all higher
    authorities. It is unquestionably a call to the heights of personal
    sacrifice. That is an extremely important lesson to learn at the
    very outset of a military career. Herman Wouk best pays tribute to
    my thought in a remark he once made at West Point to the effect that
    peace is made possible by many factors, but not the least by the
    willingness of an able few to give up personal freedom in the
    necessary discipline of a military arm. On a planet which is mostly
    not free, a free society can only live by such a sacrifice of this
    able few. In the light of this, I feel that any risks involved with
    hazing are of an acceptable level, particularly as peer pressure
    operates to constrain would-be abusers.</p>
  <p class="western">My own reaction to hazing might be worthy of
    note. In some instances I was virtually of a collaborator mentality,
    while in others I was a dedicated member of the underground. I was
    never confronted with anything worse than petty meanness, so faced
    no overwhelming moral dilemmas. Essentially I&rsquo;d try to avoid
    all possible occasions of hazing, but when backed to the wall would
    opt for the easiest way out. My credo in this regard was that I
    didn&rsquo;t think it was all that important, so minimize trouble
    for yourself. My roommate (from among the first families of
    Virginia, sir!) took some tremendous abuse for refusing to sing
    <i>Marching Through Georgia</i>. To him this was a matter of gravest
    principle and personal honor. I confess I couldn&rsquo;t understand
    this. To me it was nonsense. On the other hand, I recall taking some
    fierce whackings and verbal abuse from a first classman from D.C.
    who wanted me to tell him where he was from so he could then offer
    his hand for me to shake. This would signify that he and I, both
    being from D.C., were equals, and I did not have to shape-up for him
    and call him &ldquo;sir,&rdquo; etc. I kept giving wrong answers
    despite blatant hints because I didn&rsquo;t want to shake his hand.
    I thought he was one mean son of a bitch and had no respect for him.</p>

    Seaward Terrace &ndash; over the Mess Hall</h3>
  <p class="western">So it went until Hell Night &ndash; the night
    before graduation. This is the night when plebes get no sleep.
    Instead, they have their asses whacked all night long by
    upperclassmen returning from hops and standing atop 3-foot-high
    cruise boxes and swinging brooms with all the power of Arnold Palmer
    into your fast purpling and bleeding fanny. My roommate and I,
    having been cockily resistant to most hazing all year long, were to
    be singled out on this particular night. To make a long story short,
    we avoided it completely and never did tell the outraged
    upperclassmen how. We simply weren&rsquo;t in our room when they
    returned from the hop, and we didn&rsquo;t return in fact until
    seconds before the formation bell for breakfast parade. We could
    risk being out of our room because no commissioned officer ventured
    into Bancroft Hall on Hell Night. (They couldn&rsquo;t afford to
    risk witnessing any such rough physical hazing &ndash; which, after
    all, was a one-time-only affair.) As for the 1/c midshipman taps
    inspector who checked for us being in our room, he was the
    first-classman roommate of my roommate&rsquo;s first-classman
    brother. Not a bad parlay, that.</p>
  <p class="western">And where did we spend the night? Now it can be
    told. We were on our own deck a mere three doors away. We spent the
    night huddled in the shower of two of our classmates who were
    &ldquo;turnbacks,&rdquo; that is, they were former plebes who were
    repeating plebe year for slight academic deficiencies not warranting
    total banishment (especially as one was the star halfback on the
    football team, Ulmont Whitehead, later a Pearl Harbor casualty in
    USS Arizona). Being repeaters, they had immunity against all hazing
    and enjoyed upperclassman rights and privileges. In the course of
    the night several people burst into Whitehead&rsquo;s room begging
    to know if he knew where we were. His denials qualified for an
    Academy Award (no pun intended!), but I still don't know how these
    pleaders couldn't have heard our pounding hearts. This successful
    coup made us class celebrities on youngster cruise which immediately
    followed graduation. We had the only unmarked third-class asses on
    the whole Atlantic Ocean that summer of 1937.</p>
  <p class="western">The two days immediately following graduation and
    the completion of plebe year were more traumatic even than entrance
    into the Academy. The big difference was that I had been fantasizing
    about my entrance for months before the actual big day. Conversely,
    it turned out that our focus and concentration on just getting
    through plebe year had been so intense that we never for one second
    ever looked beyond graduation day itself. Hence the dawn of
    youngster year and my first ocean cruise came with shocking
    suddenness and tremendous impact. First of all, there was the awe
    occasioned by looking out our bedroom window at Bancroft Hall the
    morning following graduation and beholding three mighty battleships
    anchored in Chesapeake Bay. Then there was the hustle-bustle of
    hasty farewells at dockside, the lugging of seabags into waiting
    motor launches, and casting off for the longish trip to the ships
    necessarily anchored fairly far down the bay.</p>
  <p class="western">The close hauling of my new home, the USS
    Wyoming, was breath-taking. I had never seen, let alone so close up,
    such a huge and fearsome-looking man-of-war. We were rushed aboard
    and below decks, and we never even saw our departure</p>

    Embarking/Youngster cruise &ndash; June 1937</h3>
  <p class="western">The balance of the day was spent in storing our
    gear, drawing our hammocks, squaring away our living quarters, and
    learning our &ldquo;watch, quarter, and station bill&rdquo; for
    watch-standing, messing, fire and collision drills, and general
    quarters (battle stations). Almost before you knew, it we were
    experiencing our first shipboard reveille, complete with piercing
    bosun whistles, bugles, the pungent and invigorating smell of fresh
    hot coffee, and the lusty call of &ldquo;Reveille! Reveille! Drop
    your cocks and grab your socks!&rdquo; Every compartment had its
    mess-attendant-delivered pitchers of the hottest, blackest coffee
    you&rsquo;d ever see, and the coffee came just as you hit the deck.
    Then bedding was triced up and stored and you rushed topside to
    scrub down the decks. This was our first return topside since coming
    aboard, and I shall never forget the first sighting of a 360-degree
    horizon of wall-to-wall water. It was so immense, so majestic, so
    unexpected. Magnificent! (This was when Amelia Earhart became &ldquo;lost
    at sea,&rdquo; and I for one had a real appreciation of how this
    could be.)</p>
  <p class="western">We didn't know it then, but ours was to be the
    last of the traditional summer cruises to fabulous European ports.
    Hitler was to see to that. Even our cruise was modified at the last
    moment. We had been scheduled for stops at Athens, the Kiel Canal,
    and Plymouth, England. With the worsening European threat, however,
    it was thought wise not to risk containment within the Mediterranean
    Sea, so Athens was replaced by Funchal, Madeira, the so-called
    &ldquo;European Bermuda.&rdquo; Why the risk of being bottled up in
    the Kiel Canal was not similarly assayed I have no idea and, as a
    matter of fact, we almost were bottled up there. We scraped both
    sides and the USS Arkansas touched bottom several times. It was
    there that I also first witnessed the anxiety of command. I was
    midshipman helmsman of the watch during our passage of the canal, so
    I had a first-row seat.

    Enroute to Kiel canal in USS Wyoming</h3>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">At one point the
    skipper kept whispering to the exec anent the maneuvering of the
    German pilot who had the conn, &ldquo;Wiley, I don&rsquo;t like it.
    I don&rsquo;t like this at all!&rdquo; Finally, in seeming
    exasperation, the exec muttered between clenched teeth, &ldquo;Well,
    Captain, if you really don&rsquo;t like it you&rsquo;d better damn
    well take the conn!&rdquo; He did. (The nature of the difficulty as
    I was to appreciate later as an engineering officer was that the
    pilot didn&rsquo;t realize the sluggishness of battleship response
    to his tugboat-like signals.)</p>
  <p class="western">This cruise was my first experience with travel
    beyond Vineland, NJ, or Bristol, VA, and being at large on foreign
    soil was quite an experience indeed &ndash; especially being in
    military uniform. Eric Sevareid has expressed it best: &ldquo;One
    begins to understand his own country by leaving it.&rdquo; I think
    most Americans would amend that only to add that one also begins to
    more fully appreciate his own country by leaving it. This was still
    a time, too, to be heightened even more so by American triumphs of
    WWII, when as someone has said, &ldquo;the British walk the earth as
    if they own it; the Americans walk the earth as if they don&rsquo;t
    give a damn who owns it.&rdquo; (Since Vietnam and Iran, of course,
    Americans are properly a little more discreet when abroad.)</p>

    Funchal sled</h3>
  <p class="western">It was just incredible to me that a country so
    beautiful as the Germany I saw in 1937 (Frederick the Great&rsquo;s
    gardens at Sans Souci in Potsdam rank with London&rsquo;s Hampton
    Court), and so brimming with jolly, healthy, robust people (who sang
    more than they talked) would once again soon prove to be so war-like
    and so ruthlessly anti-semitic. Bands played at every little hamlet
    abutting the Kiel Canal. (I can still hum the German national
    anthem.) Flags were everywhere. Beer flowed like water. Everything
    was spic and span, people bustled with energy and apparent good
    humor. The Germans were as lock-stepping friendly as the British
    were stand-offish cold. You would have been hard pressed correctly
    to judge who would soon be faithful friend or mortal enemy. In
    Berlin, a city of night life rivaling that of New York City, we were
    welcomed as a group at city hall with splendid cigars and red wine
    by a &ldquo;representative of the Fuhrer.&rdquo; In contrast, London
    was oblivious to our presence, and the English people were as cold
    (and dare one add, &ldquo;as empty&rdquo;) as the multiplicity of
    ancient cathedrals (Exeter comes to mind) that I traipsed through in
    southern England that summer. The only Germany-like beauty
    encountered was at Shakespeare&rsquo;s Stratford-on-Avon. As for the
    food, what can one say about a people who enjoy fish for breakfast
    (as at Bath and Lemington) and insist on mutton (as tough as a very
    old boot) for dinner? (I did salvage the menu from Sam Johnson's
    Cheddar Cheese for my high school English teacher, Sr. Regina.)</p>

    The Lido &ndash; Madeira</h3>
  <p class="western">Madeira (which we sandwiched between Berlin and
    London) was a pleasant surprise &ndash; a tapestry of red-shingled
    roofs dotting steep green hillsides sloping into clear blue waters.
    As everyone knows, Madeira is the home of &ldquo;fortified wines&rdquo;
    that average 20%-plus alcoholic content compared to the more
    conventional 11%. And they&rsquo;re so smooth! As in most overseas
    locations, wine is used like water to wash down all food. One would
    get quite a warm feeling sipping Madeira at oceanside at sunset. The
    food was essentially exceptionally tangy cheeses and the most
    gorgeous fresh fruit you&rsquo;re ever likely to see. They were
    consumed in abundance at a seaside resort called the Lido, which
    featured a salt-water swimming pool with direct connecting access to
    the ocean, as well. My afternoon there still ranks as one of the
    most exhilarating of my life. This followed a morning spent in
    riding the hand-pushed or horse-drawn sleds (over cobblestone
    streets) into the hill country, there to procure the most amazing
    bargains in hand-crafted Madeira linens for tableware. You can have
    Bermuda, I&rsquo;ll take Madeira again, anytime.</p>
  <p class="western">The one place I visited on this cruise that I
    could easily afford to miss my next time around was the Bay of
    Biscay en route from Germany to Madeira. It was here that the stormy
    Atlantic first reared its ugly head to puncture my nautical dream.
    The bows of our three mighty battleships plowed several feet under
    green water as we pounded our way along. These monstrous steel
    beasts seemed little more than corks rolling, booming, groaning.
    Here the advantage of the 3/C swinging hammocks over the 1/C being
    in fixed bunks was manifest. The first-class spent the nights
    hanging on as the third-class swayed lazily in rhythm with the roll
    of the ship. (Needless to say, &ldquo;progress&rdquo; ultimately
    spelled the end of the nautical hammocks.)</p>
  <p class="western">So my first cruise came to an end. My only
    conclusion was that I&rsquo;d never opt for engineering after
    graduation. After all, in the firerooms in Wyoming you labored in an
    environment where the ambient temperature was 130 degrees F! You
    survived by sticking your face in the mouth of a fresh air blower as
    continuously as possible. Also, down below, you never knew what was
    going on never really got to see anything. Overall, I thought the
    cruise was a great adventure, and I loved the idea of taking your
    hotel with you when you traveled, as you could only do aboard ship.
    And so it was, at last, that we returned at the end of Aug 1937 to
    Norfolk for replenishment of the ship prior to our being disembarked
    at Annapolis. At dockside I rejoined my roommate, Ab, who had been
    embarked in USS New York. There I made another discovery of what can
    only be termed good fortune. Whereas the New York had obsolete
    reciprocating engines, the Wyoming had the more modern turbines.
    Since I was eventually to become an engineer (again, by chance), it
    was well that I had been exposed to equipment of the future rather
    than of the past. Ab had other good news. His younger sister,
    Melinda, would soon be there to pick us up and speed us off for a
    weekend of sunning and swimming off of their York River private
    island.</p>
  <p class="western">The less said about this weekend the better, but
    mention must be made of it. After nine months at the Naval Academy
    during which only two or three dates were allowed with Kathleen,
    followed by about three months at sea devoid of all female
    association, I was really looking forward to meeting Kathleen upon
    arrival at Annapolis. Unfortunately, the anticipated joy of this
    return was to be denied. It was short-circuited by Melinda, whose
    summer on the island had been equally devoid of male association. To
    make a long story short, ours was one of those almost idyllic
    movie-like weekends together on what might as well have been a
    desert island paradise with plumbing.</p>

    Sailing &ndash; with my and roommate&rsquo;s wives&#8209;to&#8209;be<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote7anc" href="#sdendnote7sym"><sup>7</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">Suffice it to say, I virtually never saw her
    again, certainly not alone, and I never dated her. Though I found
    her highly attractive under the circumstances, she was in her
    innocent but nevertheless imperial richness too intimidating for my
    taste. I was so uncomfortable with her life-style as to be
    positively repelled by it. In that sense, we simply had nothing of
    real importance in common. Still, the damage had been done. The
    bloom was off the rose. The long anticipated joy of being reunited
    with Kathleen at Annapolis was sadly dissipated on the York River. I
    now felt my first (and last) doubts about my commitment to Kathleen.
    Although nothing serious had happened, I was somewhat astonished at
    the ease with which my heretofore singular devotion had been
    diverted. Little wonder that I felt extremely guilty and even a
    little estranged upon finally meeting Kathleen at Annapolis. We were
    quite reserved and somewhat uncomfortable, as though the pilot light
    of our once flaming love had gone out.</p>
  <p class="western">This set the stage, then, for my third-class year
    &ndash; probably the roughest year of my entire life to date. To
    have been so confident of my life objectives and then to have been
    assailed so rudely by doubt &ndash; it was quite unsettling. I was
    sort of overwhelmed by listlessness and apathy. This very personal
    crisis carried over into my accommodation to the Academy. I had
    assumed that once I&rsquo;d survived the manufactured harassment
    that attended plebe year, well, then all would be smooth sailing,
    and I could joyfully get on with developing my professionalism for a
    service career. I was therefore shocked to discover that much of the
    detested Mickey-Mouse B.S. of plebe year was not purely a plebe-year
    phenomenon but an aspect or attribute of the military environment
    itself. In many ways, I could now see, one was always a plebe
    <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> one&rsquo;s seniors in the military pecking
    order. Worse yet, seniority did not necessarily equate with or
    signify greater competence, justice, or even common sense. Orders
    from the most stupid, sadistic jerk imaginable were as authoritative
    as those from the most intelligent and honorable military leader who
    ever lived.</p>

    Sunday after Mass</h3>
  <p class="western">All the foregoing was further compounded by the
    dull and bleak atmosphere that normally characterized the January to
    April period of any year, extending as it does from the
    post-Christmas letdown to the early spring uplift. It was in this
    period that my perplexity, disillusionment, and discouragement
    quickly dissipated into outright despair. I felt utterly oppressed
    and aimless. I wanted out. On one Sunday night phone call I told my
    father I wanted to resign at once. He was greatly disturbed, told me
    to hold everything, and paid me an urgent visit the very next
    afternoon. I can&rsquo;t remember him ever being so agitated, but
    his patience never flagged. Slowly, logically, and repeatedly he led
    me through an array of pros and cons that (without him ever
    indicating, let alone emphasizing, any particular conclusion)
    clearly and inevitably reinforced the conviction that I should see
    the year through and then re-evaluate the situation. Happily, though
    the going really got rough at times, this storm was safely
    weathered, and no re-evaluation was ever conducted.</p>

    With DAD &ndash; <i>the one and only!</i></h3>
  <p class="western">In addition to Kathleen and I gradually growing
    back into our former &ldquo;togetherness,&rdquo; it was the prospect
    of the delights of second-class summer that &ndash; as much as
    anything &ndash; snapped me out of my terrible funk. For one thing,
    In those days they had a so-called volunteer &ldquo;Executive
    Platoon&rdquo; that enabled midshipmen more or less from local areas
    to spend the bulk of the summer riding herd on the incoming plebe
    class, thereby meriting summer-long weekend leaves to return home in
    lieu of the customary September leave. This was an opportunity not
    to be missed, and I became part of that. Additionally, second-class
    summer was spiced by such goodies as getting to handle the controls
    of a PBY flying boat, using the famous Norden bomb sight to drop a
    bomb from several thousand feet onto Sharp&rsquo;s Island in the
    Chesapeake, camera-gunning the feint attacks of fighter planes, and
    a flying trip to Anacostia Naval Air Station that included an aerial
    sightseeing tour of DC. As one who at the time had never even been
    on a train, I found these flying excursions truly great adventures.
    My experience with it, however, was not without its problems.
    Whereas most pilots took great pains to show and let you try
    everything imaginable, I&rsquo;ll never forget the young Lt.(jg) who
    spent the whole one-and-one-half-hour training session shooting
    really rough landings in a small inlet of the Chesapeake. &ldquo;More
    bounce to the ounce,&rdquo; for sure. Then, too, you always had to
    be extremely alert on disembarking, especially on Saturday mornings
    when you departed this drill directly for DC weekends. Someone was
    sure to pull the toggle on your Mae West life jacket, which was worn
    under your parachute harness, and then you not only couldn&rsquo;t
    fit through the exit hatches, you had one hell of a time getting the
    harness off, and really lost valuable time on your weekend getaways.
    Then there was the day we had a cabin fire of undetermined origin at
    5,000 feet, which was sufficiently exciting to make the DC paper.
    Another highlight of this summer was a destroyer run up the Hudson
    River to West Point, (in the so called J. Fred &ldquo;Christ&rdquo;
    Talbot after &ldquo;Christ, it&rsquo;s so bad that &hellip;&rdquo;)
    followed by a weekend in NYC. I really got a sunburn on the river
    run since I spent most of the journey in the crow&rsquo;s nest
    side-by-side with roommate Ab. This was interrupted only by a stint
    on the bridge as midshipman quartermaster of the watch. This duty
    entailed a grinding two hours of keeping distance on the immediately
    preceding destroyer with a stadimeter. I was almost going blind from
    squinting until the alert O.D. laughingly told me I&rsquo;d find the
    operation a lot easier if I also kept my left eye open! As for West
    Point, I wasn&rsquo;t overly impressed. On the other hand, the
    Palisades were beautiful.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">As for NYC, this
    was the time I saw NY night life as never before or since. Ab&rsquo;s
    older sister and her advertising-executive husband really showed us
    the town. I doubt there was one night club that we didn&rsquo;t hit.
    Invariably we encountered roped-off crowds waiting for admission.
    Our host would catch the eye of the maitre d&rsquo;, wave some
    bills, and we&rsquo;d be immediately ushered up front in style. This
    little tableau was repeated time after time. I especially remember
    the Black Cat, where a torchy Billie Holiday type fondled a
    straightback chair as she sang, &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t sell it,
    I&rsquo;ll keep sitting on it, before I give it away.&rdquo; (They
    just don&rsquo;t write catchy tunes like that anymore.)</p>
  <p class="western">Then it was back to Annapolis and second-class
    year and our first radio. My research led us to Midwest, a catalog
    house that then preceded the hi-fi field. We were only allowed small
    table models, but ours had the most console-like full-base sound you
    could ever hope to hear. It also amazed our friends that it had
    (this was 1938) push-button tuning. We may have been second-class
    but our radio was first-class. (One of the first available programs
    was Orson Welles&rsquo; original <i>War of the Worlds</i> broadcast.
    Since it aired during study hour, we missed it.) It was this, as
    much as anything else, that made second-class year go so much more
    easily than the two previous years. Almost before we knew it,
    another June Week had rolled around, and this was the big one &ndash;
    the one when we would get our Academy rings. There was just one
    problem. I ended up &ldquo;unsat&rdquo; in navigation. Well,
    navigation was just about one of the easiest subjects there is, so
    I&rsquo;d use that study time to give extra attention to &ldquo;pulling
    sat&rdquo; in electricity. Since I&rsquo;d gone unsat the first
    semester while studying DC, I then had to pull sat in the more
    formidable AC. I did so at the expense of failing navigation, thanks
    to an assist by an uncompromising, red-headed, hot-tempered SOB
    Lt.(jg) instructor. &ldquo;So it goes,&rdquo; you might opine, but
    though I&rsquo;d be offered a re-exam at the end of first-class
    summer, this meant I wouldn&rsquo;t get my ring (if at all) until
    passing the re-exam. I could handle this, but it also meant I
    couldn&rsquo;t give Kathleen her miniature at the Ring Dance. This
    development was an extremely bitter business indeed. Apart from
    disappointing Kathleen in what should have been our most tender
    symbolic moment to date &ndash; the transfer of the engagement ring
    &ndash; it was a severe setback to my first potential moment of
    glory. I guess you really &ldquo;had to be there&rdquo; to
    appreciate what receiving the ring meant to one who had not only
    survived plebe year but could now see the light of
    graduation-commissioning at the end of the tunnel. Pat Conroy has
    put it best:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">When people see the (Academy) ring on your
    hand, they will know that it represents power and discipline and the
    legitimacy of your passage through the system. With this ring you
    will be accepted by the entire fellowship of the (Academy) alumni.
    You will be welcome in their ranks no matter where you may meet them
    in your travels. (Academy) men are not merely emotional about the
    ring, they are religious about it. It is the sacred symbol of the
    ideals represented by the (Academy). This circle binds you to the
    brotherhood, to the invisible ranks. This ring encircles the world.
    He who wears the ring, the great seal of the (Academy), wears it
    more proudly than any mere emperor or king.</p>

    Ring Dance &ndash; June 1939</h3>
  <p class="western">As a matter of fact, the rings (and any
    miniatures) of all unsats were delivered in bulk by Bailey, Banks
    and Biddle directly to the First Lieutenant of Bancroft Hall, then a
    LCdr. Nielson. Well, nothing ventured: nothing gained. I visited him
    in his office. I have no recollection of what I said (or how) to Cdr
    Nielson, but eventually he got up from behind his desk, worked the
    combination of a nearby safe, and I soon left him happily carrying
    both rings.</p>
  <p class="western">I do remember that this transaction was not
    accomplished as simply and easily as this mere recital might
    suggest. In any event, June Week thereupon proceeded normally. (And
    the ring, or course, finally disclosed our intentions to our folks!)
    Music for our Ring Dance was provided by the then-popular Larry
    Clinton Band, which always had several hits on the nickelodeon at
    any particular time. Kathleen and I still laugh over the
    recollection of our sharing a bench in smoke park with Bill Howard
    and his date, Bonnie, during one dance set. Both couples were
    exchanging tender kisses when Bill pulled out and exclaimed, &ldquo;Jesus!
    Listen to that tenor sax!&rdquo; The mood could never be regained.</p>

    June Week &ndash; 1940</h3>
  <p class="western">If Hitler had forced modification of our
    youngster cruise, and he had, he surely bollixed our first-class
    cruise. Any sortie to famous European ports was out of the question.
    We were to get no further than the Bay of Fundy with its amazing
    50-foot tides. From there we visited Quebec&rsquo;s Chateau
    Frontenac. Also, whereas everyone else opted for a trip to Montreal,
    Ab and I and one other classmate were the sole selectors of an
    option for a boat trip up the Saguenay River to Le Manoir Richelieu,
    where a leading radio band of the day, Luigi Romanelli, held forth.
    A 1982 ad in the AAA&rsquo;s magazine states that Le Manoir
    Richelieu is &ldquo;perched some 700 feet directly above the Saint
    Laurent, [a] legendary castle in the tradition of a stately French
    manor&hellip; The cuisine is a delight and the wine cellar
    impressive.&rdquo; Rooms, available on the modified American plan
    (with breakfast and dinner furnished) and based on double occupancy,
    are $861.00 <i>per person</i>! Now, <i>that</i> is class!</p>
  <p class="western">Romanelli&rsquo;s band (patterned after the old
    folk-dancing style of Shep Fields, Russ Morgan, and later Lawrence
    Welk) was featured at noon on weekdays on NBC. I well remember
    sitting in the large open veranda-like band and dance area one
    noontime as the announcer solemnly intoned, &ldquo;Now, from Manoir
    Richelieu, bathed in glorious sunshine high above the St. Lawrence
    in the province of Quebec, Canada, we bring you, etc., etc.&rdquo;
    The fact is, it was pouring rain at the time. In all events, we were
    instant celebrities. Publicity pictures were even taken of us with
    the band, and with its freshly imported little French chanteuse
    named Lucille. It was at Le Manoir Richelieu that I discovered
    whiskey sours, where we&rsquo;d enjoy two or three each evening as
    our nightcaps. Then we&rsquo;d sit up with band members in their
    rooms to catch the midnight broadcast of Bunny Berrigan playing from
    NYC. Oh, to be young!</p>
  <p class="western">Our next big stop was NYC, which was then
    featuring its famous World Fair (running from 30 April to 31 October
    1939). In between ports, I spent all my time studying. As an &ldquo;unsat
    first-classman,&rdquo; I was excused from all watch-standing and all
    assignments. My time was fully my own except for shipboard-wide
    exercises, like fire and collision drills. The first problem was
    finding a suitable study location. I made friends with a first-class
    gunner&rsquo;s mate who was &ldquo;captain&rdquo; of #2 turret. A
    turret captain is one of the headier enlisted billets. Mahoney had
    complete charge of #2 turret. It was his province. He was king. He
    was my friend. So it was that I spent first-class cruise at a fine
    private desk, complete with lamp and padded chair, at about
    mid-level of barbette #2. (A barbette is the entirely heavily
    armored underwater trunk of a main battery turret through which the
    ammunition train passes to the turret&rsquo;s guns.) It was well
    ventilated and virtually soundproof with respect to outside noise. I
    was completely isolated from everyone except during gun drills, for
    which I was the pointer, and which occasioned my punctured ear drum
    &ndash; <i>discovered in 1983</i>. Mahoney almost used the barbette
    as a personal locker. While preparing for a shore liberty, he would
    marvel at my steadfast attachment to his desk in wrapped study &ndash;
    until the day he discovered me studying the Esquire Magazine Guide
    to the NYC World Fair.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, I was ready for that, too. This was the one
    that featured the famous Trylon and Perisphere, GM&rsquo;s Cyclorama
    (or some such?), and <i>The Hot</i> (jazzed up) <i>Mikado</i> of
    Gilbert and Sullivan fame from which Erskine Hawkins&rsquo; great
    band later made two outstanding cuts. Kathleen joined me for this
    great holiday, and I think in retrospect that the whole business is
    superbly illustrative of the &ldquo;Wonderland&rdquo; atmosphere
    that attends the military life. The 24-hour clock is highly symbolic
    of it all. To put it simply, the military live a life of their own,
    according to their own calendar and their own clock, in a tight
    little cocoon totally oblivious to the real world. Show me a
    military person who is not counting the days to some strictly
    personal event, and I&rsquo;ll show you a corpse. This was September
    1939 for chrissake! The previous September witnessed the sellout at
    Munich, and the one after that saw FDR trying to pack the Supreme
    Court. Germany and the USSR had just sealed a mutual peace pact on
    24 August. Hitler (who had already occupied the Rhineland and seized
    Austria) invaded Poland on 1 September. Great Britain and France
    declared war on Germany on 3 September. <i>We</i> celebrated the New
    York City World Fair.</p>

    Christmas leave &ndash; 39/40</h3>
  <p class="western">I found it the same from the very start. At the
    beginning of my plebe year Hitler was unfurling his plans for
    conquest. Japan flexed its muscles and tested our will by overtly
    bombing our gunship, the Panay, killing two American sailors. Ab and
    I spent a good deal of our time inventing games. We even went AWOL.
    Ab returned to the Academy from Sep leave in the family Pontiac,
    still garaged just outside the Main Gate. We shed caps, coats, and
    ties and took off for DC, stopping to pick up Kathleen, there to see
    the very first (and my last) Redskin game which featured the debut
    of Slinging Sammy Baugh downing Ace Parker&rsquo;s Brooklyn Dodgers
    16 to 7. Fortunately, unlike one of the heroes of James Webb&rsquo;s
    <i>A Sense of Honor</i>, we didn&rsquo;t get undone by encountering
    an accident.</p>
  <p class="western">Ab and I weren&rsquo;t alone in our holiday
    outlook. Sailors live for leaves and liberties. The most profound
    world events pass virtually unnoticed. Perhaps this was a carryover
    from the days before Marconi invented that infernal disc-jockey
    device called &ldquo;radio,&rdquo; when sailors at sea were really
    out of touch with the rest of the world, and officers had to be
    prepared to function as on-the-spot instant international diplomats.
    But the fact remains, the military environment begets an unreal
    keep-the-party-going mood.</p>
  <p class="western">I recall that first-class year, like my senior
    year in high school, was an academic lark. I won my highest mark
    ever that year, a 3.25 in English from Capt. John B. Heffernan,
    later C.O. of battleship Tennessee at Okinawa. My contribution to
    any and all lab exams was to be volunteer data-taker for my smarter
    classmates. On 2 October FDR invoked a neutrality patrol in the
    Atlantic. In Annapolis Ab and I smuggled a bass viol out of the
    NA-10 bandroom under the Dahlgren Hall end of the Bancroft Hall
    basement, with two plebe musicians in the car trunk. The four of us
    then whipped across the Severn to the Anchor Inn, there to augment a
    sharp little black jazz combo for a Sunday afternoon of cool jazz.
    The party continued. I became a feature writer/record reviewer for
    our weekly <i>Log</i>. I contacted all the major record companies
    (there were less than half a dozen) and thereafter got regular free
    consignments of all new releases. I kicked off a &ldquo;Music on
    Campus&rdquo; series in no less than show-biz&rsquo;s <i>Variety</i>.</p>

    Letter from Life Magazine<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote13anc" href="#sdendnote13sym"><sup>13</sup></a>&#8209;<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote14anc" href="#sdendnote14sym"><sup>14</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">Yet my first-class year was not altogether a free
    ride. As usual, I had my problems. At the end of the first semester
    I found myself unsat again &ndash; this time in &ldquo;grease,&rdquo;
    that is, &ldquo;aptitude for the service.&rdquo; this meant that
    although I might well meet all physical and academic requirements, I
    still might fail to receive a commission upon graduation for the
    simple reason that the pooh-bahs found me unsuitable officer
    material. My translation of this would be that I wasn&rsquo;t found
    acceptable because I refused to &ldquo;kiss ass.&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t
    a so-called brown-nose. I wouldn&rsquo;t, as some nameless sage has
    neatly expressed it &ldquo;eat shit.&rdquo; Any first-classman unsat
    in grease was thereafter exclusively assigned to stand all his
    watches (which were 24-hour stints that occurred about every 3 or 4
    weeks) in the Main Office of Bancroft Hall. There I would be under
    the immediate eye and supervision of the <i>commissioned</i> officer
    of the watch. Thenceforth my &ldquo;grease&rdquo; marks would be
    assigned by a genuine naval officer rather than by one of my
    midshipman peers who was a &ldquo;striper.&rdquo; <a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote15anc" href="#sdendnote15sym"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
  <p class="western">Well, I thought this was great. The first-class
    midshipman Main Office Officer of the Watch billet afforded just
    about as much responsibility and power as any midshipman in the
    regiment could garner. Certainly it provided the only opportunity I
    ever had at Annapolis to really be in charge of anything. (I never
    so much as led a squad otherwise.) Among other things, I took all
    incoming calls to Bancroft Hall and decided upon appropriate action.
    (Not infrequently the operator would have to cut in on my elongated
    chats with Kathleen, who could then dial me direct!) I also received
    all incoming telegrams. As often as not such contacts involved
    serious crises. I soon learned that telegrams bearing serious bad
    news contained a star in the address, and those advising of a death
    contained two stars. (I noticed many years later that the telegram
    advising of George&rsquo;s accident contained no such indicator. The
    thing that surprised me more was that, even after all the
    intervening years, that was the first thing I looked for upon
    receiving it.)</p>
  <p class="western">But, to make a long story longer, let me just say
    that I ended up gaining a commendation for innovations. The
    improvements I proposed in Main Office procedures won me the best
    &ldquo;grease&rdquo; marks of my entire Naval Academy career. The
    officer who commended me was Cdr Jerauld Wright, who accompanied FDR
    to his meeting with Churchill and DeGaulle in Casablanca, and later
    was Commander-in-Chief of the Atlantic Fleet. He and I hit it off
    great (and I don&rsquo;t know how much &ndash; if any &ndash; of
    this was due to the commonality of our surnames), and he made no
    effort to disguise the fact that he was quite impressed with the
    extra dimension of innovation that I had brought to running the Main
    Office.
  </p>
  <p class="western">The question at issue &ndash; my suitability for
    service &ndash; was a valid one. I not only was not gregarious, I
    was exceedingly shy (as evidenced even by the total absence of any
    inclination to follow up the Melinda incident.) I had no close
    friend beyond my immediate roommate, and was definitely not a
    joiner. This predisposition was enhanced to some degree, I&rsquo;m
    sure, by the complete fulfillment Kathleen and I experienced in
    merely just being alone together. But my estrangement from the flow
    of Academy life went even deeper than that. I never really felt that
    I was a part of it all. I have never returned for a &ldquo;homecoming.&rdquo;
    Again perhaps Pat Conroy has said it best:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I only knew that I didn&rsquo;t see things
    exactly as my classmates did. Something was different about me, and
    I suffered because of that difference. Not many of my classmates
    will agree with many of my observations or conclusions about the
    system. They will say I was embittered, and I was. They will say
    that I did not belong there, and they will be right.</p>

    <i>Hell Cats</i></h3>
  <p class="western">I would add one further thought. The essence of
    the military system is the molding of people as &ldquo;interchangeable
    parts.&rdquo; My essence consisted in a craving to realize more
    fully my own uniqueness. I would sense this when I would experience
    a breath of freedom during leaves at home. (This had nothing to do
    with being home, since I spent all possible time with Kathleen, but
    it had everything to do with being out of Bancroft Hall.) I even
    experienced it when I passed the mixed crowd of happy collegians on
    the campuses at Princeton, Yale, and Harvard when we marched to and
    from football games. They were so evidently tasting life, and we
    were so obviously artificially suppressed. They were individuals,
    while we were replaceable cogs. In so many respects, the Academy was
    a virtual seminary.

    A snare, a delusion, and a dream</h3>
  <p class="western">Some aspects of the operation were absurd, much
    of it was demeaning, and all of it was restrictive. Still, my
    difficulties with the system had even more dimensions. For example,
    there was the obvious &ldquo;good-old-boy network&rdquo; that passed
    down the plums, and you had to be either an outstanding scholar,
    even a mediocre football player, a supreme ass-kisser, a red-necked
    southerner or simply a neutral &ldquo;Midwesterner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">One of the most depressing things about General
    of the Army Omar Bradley&rsquo;s <i>A General&rsquo;s Life</i> is
    that his memoirs testify to this cliquishness again and again. Worse
    yet, he is totally oblivious to this, and obviously believes he is
    doing credit to himself, even as he engenders rising disgust &ndash;
    at least in this reader. This elite cadre not only thinks that
    everybody outside the cadre is a jerk, they each individually think
    that they are the only one in the cadre that is not a jerk! This
    becomes horrendously evident as one reads of the GI tragedies these
    egomaniacs perpetrated in pursuit of personal headlines during WWII.
    And they almost uniformly lacked genuine guts, as in forever
    remanding subordinates under the cop-out of &ldquo;without
    prejudice.&rdquo; A dead giveaway of this megalomania of our
    military leaders is, for instance, that Bradley never introduces a
    character into his memoirs without immediately appending his class
    number and standing, and more often than not, his athletic
    affiliation.

    LAST formation &ndash; June 1940, 3rd Battalion Terrace</h3>
  <p class="western">General Matthew Ridgeway and Admiral Raymond
    Spruance seem to be outstanding exceptions. Of Ridgeway, no less
    than Bradley himself has said, &ldquo;His brilliant, driving,
    uncompromising leadership would turn the tide of battle like no
    other general in our military history.&rdquo; Of Spruance, naval
    historian Samuel Eliot Morison remarks, &ldquo;When it comes to the
    Admirals who commanded at sea, and who decided a great battle, there
    was no one to equal Spruance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Well, all the foregoing, to my mind, would seem
    to preclude the possibility of developing real leaders. JC said it
    best, to the effect that a true leader becomes in reality a servant
    of those led. Such a thought would be entirely alien to our military
    chieftains. They weren&rsquo;t prone to take the point, stick their
    necks out, or make waves. Rather, the moistened finger was ever
    raised aloft, testing the winds, and any and all failures were
    perfunctorily dismissed via the first available scapegoats. This, I
    strongly feel, was an inevitable by-product of the system.
    Initiative was routinely stifled even as rigidity and caution were
    lauded (via example more so than speech) as the ultimate virtue.</p>

    LAST P-rade &ndash; June 1940</h3>
  <p class="western">This would be an unnecessary and severely
    handicapping outlook in many lines of endeavor, but it is, it seems
    to me, particularly dangerous in the military realm. Newsman
    Harrison Salisbury&rsquo;s observation is relevant: &ldquo;I am wary
    of precise rules. Precision puts human conduct into a straitjacket.
    We are a disorderly species. Clean-cut cases are rare, and unless we
    recognize that there must be exceptions (e.g., I add: Rickover) we
    bind ourselves to rigidity and nonsense.&rdquo; Exactly! But once
    again we shall leave the last word to Pat Conroy:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">We didn&rsquo;t receive a college education
    at the (Academy), we received an indoctrination, and all our courses
    were designed to make us malleable, unimaginative, uninquisitive
    citizens of the republic, impregnable to ideas or thought
    unsanctioned by authority. We learned to be safe. The (Academy) was
    making us stupid; irretrievably, tragically, and infinitely stupid.</p>

    Washington Post graduation announcement, 1940<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote16anc" href="#sdendnote16sym"><sup>16</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">Little wonder, then, that it was with some
    considerable pride that I found myself perhaps &ldquo;not suited&rdquo;
    to this cadre of military elite. So, do I then regret my years at
    USNA? Not at all. I&rsquo;m saddened that I couldn&rsquo;t have made
    more of them personally &ndash; even as I&rsquo;m satisfied that I
    was probably stretched to the limits of my admittedly meager
    talents. I&rsquo;m saddened, too, that my initial idealism about the
    &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; emerged so tarnished, but denying this
    unhappy outcome would serve no good purpose. There were good aspects
    to it all. Not the least of these were that in a post-Depression era
    I was paid (the handsome sum of $125/month) for in effect going to
    college. An even greater practical benefit was that I was better
    prepared than most of my peers for participation in the gigantic
    world war that almost immediately followed my graduation. Also, I
    would have a &ldquo;position,&rdquo; and one that carried with it a
    certain degree of inherent prestige. More than anything, I looked
    forward enthusiastically to the freedom from ritual for ritual&rsquo;s
    sake that was part and parcel of the Academy system.</p>

      about USNA graduation, Class of 1940<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote17anc" href="#sdendnote17sym"><sup>17</sup></a></b></font></font></h3>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">So I graduated on
    6 June 1940, three days following the exodus that was Dunkirk. The
    &ldquo;phony war&rdquo; had come to an end and Germany had now
    overrun Belgium and Holland even as Churchill was replacing
    Chamberlain in England. The Secretary of the Navy told us that we
    were &ldquo;ready.&rdquo; At the University of Virginia, FDR was
    telling the country that it had best be ready. Ours was the 94th
    class to depart Severn&rsquo;s shores. Out of a class of 456, I was
    439 &ndash; 17th from the bottom. That may sound bad until you
    realize that, of our original 736 plebes, only 396 survived to be
    commissioned as Ensigns &ndash; an astounding attrition rate of 46%,
    exactly double that of 1983! (The apparent discrepancy between 456
    and 396 is accounted for by many things. For example: one was
    released to study for the priesthood; 32 were not commissioned for
    &ldquo;physical reasons&rdquo;; and 25 were not commissioned Ensigns
    for &ldquo;mental reasons&rdquo; &ndash; that is, they opted for the
    Marine Corps.) And, ready or not, our class suffered both more
    numerical (49) and greater percentile (10.7%) combat losses in WWII
    than any other Naval Academy class.</p>

    With paternal <font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>grandparents</b></font></font></h3>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">Speaking of
    losses, both of my father&rsquo;s parents were lost during my Naval
    Academy tour. My grandmother died at the beginning of plebe year
    (Sep 37), and my grandfather died toward the end of first class year
    (Jan 40). I was granted special leave for both funerals due to my
    father&rsquo;s persuasive requests. I remember sitting up alone all
    night with my father at my grandfather&rsquo;s wake. I still recall
    Pop turning to me solemnly during the middle of the night after
    surveying Grandpa&rsquo;s remains for an extended period and saying,
    &ldquo;Now, he knows!&rdquo; And I remember thinking &ldquo;Pop,
    don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">So graduation came and went. I now had an
    education which 1983 estimates place at being worth $100,000, and
    not only had I been paid while getting it, I now had a firm job
    offer! And good fortune didn&rsquo;t stop there. Now there would be
    no more freezing in the stands at Army-Navy football games in
    seemingly always snowy Philadelphia. I wouldn&rsquo;t miss the long
    after-game walks into downtown Philadelphia (neither adequate nearby
    parking nor public transportation were available), there to stand in
    line at overflowing restaurants. No more quiet but fleeting moments
    with Kathleen on the loveseat under the stairs at the Feldmeyer
    sisters&rsquo; boarding house following Academy hops.</p>

    Jack&rsquo;s Children at Mt Vernon in 2015<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote18anc" href="#sdendnote18sym"><sup>18</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">No more grilled cheese sandwiches with chocolate
    sundaes at the Greasy Spoon. No long rides following games back to
    Annapolis in antique RR coaches filled with smoke and puking
    midshipmen unused to drinking. No more dreaded returns following
    exhilarating Christmas leaves to the dreary, barren halls of
    Bancroft Hall. No more rushing in response to formation bells. Now I
    was off to join the fleet.</p>
  <p class="western">My orders bore the signature of Fleet Admiral
    Chester W. Nimitz &ndash; another of the few exceptional officers in
    my view. Morison says he &ldquo;inspired more personal loyalty than
    did any other admiral in the navy.&rdquo; The orders were to report
    to the heavy cruiser USS Tuscaloosa, my first choice. I gained this
    plum despite low class standing since most of my more ambitious
    classmates opted for the subsequently sitting-duck battleships in
    Pearl Harbor. Tuscaloosa was then undergoing overhaul at Navy Yard,
    New York, and I was to report aboard on 26 June 1940. (I was
    reimbursed the magnificent sum of $17.20 for 215 miles travel from
    Annapolis to New York City at 8 cents a mile.) Unfortunately, no one
    had alerted me to the protocol fact that to report 26 June meant to
    report before 0800 morning &ldquo;quarters&rdquo; was sounded aboard
    Tuscaloosa on 26 June. Hence I was greeted at the gangway about 1630
    that afternoon by an obviously disgusted O.O.D. who told me that the
    executive officer wanted to see me the minute I reported aboard.
    Virtually the first words of greeting from the masters of my new
    home, therefore, turned out to be a devastating dressing-down for
    nonprofessionalism and stupidity. Talk about getting off on the
    wrong foot!</p>
  <p class="western">It seems I had missed an entire day of special
    indoctrination lectures and drills. My fellow classmates, who had
    reported the night before, were delirious with laughter. Way to go,
    Jack! I don&rsquo;t know how it was that I&rsquo;d failed to get the
    word about reporting. It was remindful of the Prince of Wales&rsquo;
    confession that the very best advice he&rsquo;d ever gotten was from
    an old footman who warned, &ldquo;never pass up an opportunity to go
    to the head or to sit down.&rdquo; In a similar vein, the only
    memorable advice I could recall from Naval Academy days was from a
    French teacher, Lt. LaForce, who would begin each class with
    &ldquo;Gentlemen, I don&rsquo;t know now much French you&rsquo;ll
    learn today, but learn this vital maxim now, once and for all &ndash;
    never pass up an opportunity to take as much leave as you have
    coming whenever you can.&rdquo; Well, I was ready for some leave
    (sick leave!) already! Unfortunately Lt. LaForce had neglected to
    discuss reporting protocol.</p>

  <p class="western">As if things weren&rsquo;t already bad enough, I
    was then told I&rsquo;d been assigned to the engineering officer,
    and that I should report to him. I couldn&rsquo;t have been received
    more coldly if I&rsquo;d been wearing a leper&rsquo;s bell. My boss
    was LCdr. William Franklin Slavin, and he made no bones about the
    fact that he wasn&rsquo;t overjoyed to have me assigned to him. He
    dispassionately declaimed how he and the other heads of department
    had tossed liar&rsquo;s dice for the order of selection and that
    he&rsquo;d been the big loser. I was feeling more terrific by the
    minute. I didn&rsquo;t know it then, but this was the most
    providential stroke of good fortune possible with respect to my
    total professional career. First of all, although it would have been
    my last choice, engineering thereupon became my life&rsquo;s work.
    This presented a freaky parallel with my father&rsquo;s career
    development &ndash; I virtually fell into engineering, and thence
    computers, even as he had just sort of toppled into the field of
    international law and political science.</p>
  <p class="western">Another happy aspect of this chance assignment
    was the character of Cdr. Slavin. He was an exceptional engineer and
    an outstanding gentleman &ndash; an all-around true professional.
    His very first move was to hand me a small book which included the
    motto heading this chapter: Elbert Hubbard&rsquo;s <i>A Message to
      Garcia</i>. It was an 1899 account of the dogged determination of a
    Lt. Andrew Rowan in surmounting incredible hardships as he
    successfully persisted in delivering an allegedly important message.
    &ldquo;Sealed in an oilskin pouch which he carried over his heart,&rdquo;
    Rowan bore the message from our government in Washington to a rebel
    General in the heart of the Cuban jungle, on the eve of the
    Spanish-American War. This essay on duty, courage, and fortitude was
    a sensation, and has to date sold at least 80 million copies, which
    have been printed in 20 languages. Rowan did exist, and did search
    out General Calixto Garcia in Cuba, but the alleged letter in fact
    never existed. Rowan&rsquo;s assignment was to secure data on troop
    strength, arms, and even sanitary conditions, all of which he did.
    He once joked to a woman at a party years later that the alleged
    letter was merely an invitation from President McKinley to an
    old-fashioned New England dinner at the White House. Such is the
    grist of legends!</p>
  <p class="western">Cdr. Slavin merely told me to go to my room and
    read the book and that he didn&rsquo;t want to even see me again
    until I had fully digested it. Nothing could have better prepared me
    for succeeding in the Navy than this little gem of an unabashed
    exhortation to persevere in fulfillment of duty. Matthew Ridgeway
    echoed the same basic principle when he confessed that early on he
    learned &ldquo;the lessons that every young officer (has) to learn
    to take any job that (is) handed to him, whether he (knows) anything
    about it or not.&rdquo; The accent is on confidence,
    resourcefulness, and persistence, which are basic prerequisites for
    anyone who would be a leader. In consequence of this written
    sermonette, I didn&rsquo;t question my next and first practical
    assignment: &ldquo;Wright, I want you to go into that Navy yard and
    not return aboard until you&rsquo;ve completed arrangements to get
    #3 Main feed pump overhauled without benefit of any work order or
    funds allotment. Understood?&rdquo; &ldquo;Aye, aye, Sir!&rdquo; (We
    got the free overhaul.)</p>
  <p class="western">The period of June to December 1940 was another
    one of those times (like during the Depression) when my personal
    fortunes were 180 degrees out of phase with world conditions. The
    Dunkirk debacle-miracle (338,000 men escaped to freedom!) occurred
    on 5 June, Hitler took Paris on 14 June, and France fell on 22 June.
    (Hitler had thus accomplished in a mere month what the Kaiser could
    not in four years.) Such were the world happenings even as I
    reported aboard Tuscaloosa (following a most pleasant 18-day
    graduation leave) on 26 June, almost coincidentally with FDR&rsquo;s
    14 June signing of a &ldquo;Two-Ocean Navy&rdquo; bill. Meanwhile,
    although I worked very hard aboard ship learning my new job, a sort
    of holiday atmosphere continued aboard Tuscaloosa. This ship had a
    top-to-bottom esprit I was never to encounter again. Little wonder
    that several of the senior officers went on to become Vice Admirals,
    one (a mere Lt. then, in charge of deck watch officers) going on to
    become the right-hand-man of later CNO Forrest Sherman.</p>
  <p class="western">These folks were genuine professionals in all the
    best senses of the word, and their very demeanor communicated a
    desire to excel. Yet the spirit was at the same time happy and
    relaxed, and friendly rather than competitive. (We even had a band
    embarked, who delighted one and all by rendering &ldquo;Empty
    Saddles in the Old Corral&rdquo; or &ldquo;Back in the Saddle Again&rdquo;
    according to whether we were leaving or entering port.) Between
    gunnery exercises and other drills we spent many pleasant afternoons
    playing softball at Guantanamo Bay (with a can of warm Hatuey Cuban
    beer awaiting the base-runner at every base), then swimming in
    brilliant but crystal-clear blue water off the pier at the O-Club,
    followed by gin and tonics accompanied by sardines and lemon juice
    on crackers. Then back to the ship for &ldquo;seven boy curry&rdquo;
    served on silver service and immaculate white linen, followed by a
    new movie on the well deck, and &ldquo;all night in and beans for
    breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">This, then, is the account of my venturing from a
    secluded home into the worldwide theater afforded by service in the
    U.S. Navy. It was a frantic, busy time, a time for growing up &ldquo;on
    the double.&rdquo; So busy, in fact, that little mention has been
    made of home or love. To take up that latter first, in the brief
    weekend flings we enjoyed over my four years at the Naval Academy,
    and apart from the momentary digression accorded by Melinda,
    Kathleen and I grew ever closer together. We corresponded in depth
    not only regularly but frequently. All was well there. As for home,
    the family too paid frequent visits to the Naval Academy, especially
    during plebe year. That was about it, though, except for my mother.
    Whereas I received perhaps only two letters from my father in my
    life, and none from my brother or sister, my mother wrote faithfully
    throughout the course of my entire 12 years in the service. This is
    a matter of some moment, since these letters revealed more of my
    mother to me than any face-to-face conversation ever did. (This is,
    perhaps, why I favor letters over personal talks until this very day
    when something serious is on my mind.) I regret that neither my
    brother nor my sister (except for very late in life) ever shared
    this medium for growth in understanding of our mother.</p>
  <p class="western">So, summer passed into the fall of 1940. The
    Battle of Britain began on 8 August and exploded into the blitz
    extending from 7 September to 31 October. Meanwhile Japan had joined
    with Axis forces on 27 September, so the threat to our American
    sanctuary was ever widening. So it was that Selective Service was
    initiated on 16 September, and some 16 million American youths
    between years 18 and 25 were to receive firm job offers from Uncle
    Sam before the month of November ended. The wisdom of my selection
    of the Naval Academy already stood well confirmed. While my civilian
    peers were now scurrying into military garb, I was already
    comfortably ensconced in a heavy cruiser of the U.S. Navy, complete
    with 14&quot; armor and nine 8&quot; guns. It was against this
    background that I received my very first &ldquo;Report of the
    Fitness of Officers.&rdquo; My profile ran thus: &ldquo;Ensign
    Wright is a quiet, unassuming young officer, conscientious in his
    performance of duty, and willing and quick to learn. With more
    experience he should round out into an excellent officer.&rdquo; At
    least my at-first-reluctant immediate boss had now become a convert,
    but the highlight of my Tuscaloosa tour lay immediately ahead.</p>

	&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Isaiah&nbsp;41:6c</span></p>
  <p class="western">Shortly before two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon
    of 3 Dec 1940, the huge crowd assembled on Miami&rsquo;s Municipal
    Pier 3 let go with a loud and sustained roar as a caravan of
    automobiles stopped abreast of the warship docked alongside. A
    familiar male figure was soon seen &ldquo;swinging aboard&rdquo;
    (literally, though they couldn&rsquo;t see through the
    canvas-shrouded sides of the gangplank that obscured heavily-braced
    legs which scarcely touched the deck) via the uncommonly
    close-together handrails of the forward starboard gangplank
    hand-over-hand. He was in civilian garb, with a somewhat crushed
    fedora perched jauntily on the back of his head, and his pale face
    frozen in a broad, infectious grin. He paused briefly to salute the
    colors and the Officer of the Deck as he reached the quarterdeck,
    and immediately the flag of the President of the United States was
    smartly broken from the maintruck. The Commander in Chief, Franklin
    D. Roosevelt, was now embarked on the heavy cruiser USS Tuscaloosa.</p>
  <p class="western">The President stood at the deck-edge rail, waving
    cheerfully to the throng on the dock as the ship got underway at
    once and sped out through the harbor of Biscayne Bay. As the crowd
    on the pier gradually merged into the indistinguishable shoreline,
    the President turned to proceed to his quarters. Free of public view
    at last, he visibly shed his alert military posture and lapsed into
    an obviously spent and weary human being. Clearly, the man was
    tired, and I bet that every officer and man aligned in his honor on
    the quarterdeck breathed the same silent benediction: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
    alone with friends now, Mr. President, you just relax and we&rsquo;ll
    do all we can to help you recharge your batteries.&rdquo; The crew
    in Tuscaloosa, after all, was practically his &ldquo;family,&rdquo;
    this being the president&rsquo;s third sojourn aboard within the
    past eighteen months. In Aug 1939 Tuscaloosa carried him to
    Campobello Island, Nova Scotia, where he watched salvage operations
    then underway on the ill-fated submarine Squalus. More recently, in
    Feb 1940, Tuscaloosa transported the Commander in Chief from
    Pensacola via the Panama Canal to Baya Honda, Costa Rica, Cocas
    Island, and the Isles of Seca.</p>
  <p class="western">But now it Dec 1940, and things had changed
    mightily. France had fallen to Hitler in June, even as I joined the
    ship's company. The Dunkirk redeployment (to use <i>Reagan-speak</i>)
    had come and gone, the blockade of Britain began on the seventeenth
    of August. The Battle of Britain &ndash; &ldquo;their finest hour&rdquo;
    &ndash; carried from 7 Sep through the end of October. Nevertheless
    Great Britain was still threatened by the imminent invasion of a
    Nazi war machine which had already conquered most of Western Europe,
    and Japan was increasingly menacing In the Far East, probing further
    and further into China. The Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign
    Relations Committee had gone so far as to say, &ldquo;I call upon
    the British Government to abandon the British Isles.&rdquo; In his
    own memoirs, Churchill himself titles his history of the period from
    Jul 1940 to Jan 1941 simply &ndash; &ldquo;ALONE.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Gallup polls in late 1940, while confirming that
    a majority of Americans conceded that the British were fighting for
    American interests, indicated that something less than 13 percent
    were for the United States going to war With Germany. FDR tried to
    dispel the evident apathy by proclaiming, &ldquo;Never before since
    Jamestown and Plymouth Rock has our American civilization been in
    such danger.&rdquo; Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau labeled
    this apathy &ldquo;the blue fog here in Washington, that Britain is
    licked!&rdquo; Seemingly, things were tough all over, and this is
    the apparent backdrop against which the president appeared to be
    embarking upon a holiday. (It was all so remindful of Kaiser
    Wilhelm's idyllic 20-day cruise even as the time-bomb that was to
    become WWI relentlessly ticked toward detonation. This was the
    period of 6&ndash;26 Jul 1914, which bridged the incident at
    Sarajevo and Great Britain&rsquo;s actual entry into WWI on 4 Aug.
    Little wonder that military historian S.L.A. Marshall opines that
    this relaxing little sojourn at sea might better be labeled &ldquo;one
    of the greatest marine disasters&rdquo; of all time!)</p>
  <p class="western">Criticism was quick in coming, despite the fact
    that, on top of everything else, the president had just won
    re-election to an unprecedented third term after an extremely bitter
    and exceedingly exhausting campaign. So he needed a rest, but, after
    all, Great Britain was in the lines &ndash; alone &ndash; the last
    bastion between American complacency and Hitler&rsquo;s expanding
    madness. What, indeed, was the Commander in Chief of our armed
    forces to do at this critical juncture? The press had badgered him
    prior to departure as to where he was going. The president parried
    questions with characteristically good-humored changes of the
    subject: &ldquo;I wish I knew &ndash; maybe to Christmas Island to
    buy Christmas cards, maybe to Easter Island to buy Easter eggs.&rdquo;
    And the make-up of the small party of accompanying associates didn&rsquo;t
    provide any clues, either. This group included General &ldquo;Pa&rdquo;
    Watson, the president&rsquo;s secretary and military aide; Admiral
    Ross McIntire, the president&rsquo;s personal physician; Captain Dan
    Callaghan, his naval aide; one special friend and guest, Harry
    Hopkins. He was also accompanied, of course, by a communications
    specialist, Chief Pharmacist, Chief Boatswain&rsquo;s Mate, and
    Chief Yeoman, and his newly acquired Scottie, &ldquo;Fala.&rdquo;
    The world might be going to hell, but the president&rsquo;s presence
    aboard my ship assured me of a ring-side seat.</p>

  <p class="western">Actually we knew the Commander in Chief was
    headed our way long before the American people or even the
    ever-probing press. Taking aboard such an august guest requires a
    lot of advance preparation, all the more so in view of the
    president&rsquo;s polio-crippled legs. All through the summer and
    fall of 1940 Tuscaloosa had been engaged in combination V-7 training
    cruises and on Neutrality Patrol (designed to forestall military
    operation within 300 miles of the Atlantic coast) in the
    Bermuda-Caribbean area. The V-7 program was the Navy version of
    accelerated ROTC programs, and I must state straightaway that these
    so-called &ldquo;90-day wonders&rdquo; were precisely that
    (wonders!), and soon, to my mind at least, made the real
    regimentation and specialization of the Naval Academy seem virtually
    superfluous. These guys were generally excellent officers.</p>

    Magazine article about FDR voyage aboard USS Tuscaloosa, Dec 1940<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote20anc" href="#sdendnote20sym"><sup>20</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">In any event, Tuscaloosa was suddenly but quietly
    recalled to Norfolk, Virginia, Naval Operating Base. It soon became
    apparent we were being fitted out for another presidential cruise.
    There is just no way you can disguise the president&rsquo;s &ldquo;barge,&rdquo;
    which provides his luxury-equipped personal ship-to-shore
    transportation whenever the vessel is &ldquo;anchored out&rdquo;
    rather than secured to a dock. Neither can you camouflage the
    numerous carefully fitted plywood wedges used to bridge the lower
    coamings of the watertight doors to ease the passage of the
    president&rsquo;s wheelchair. (I&rsquo;ll never forget how heartened
    and edified I was in these perilous times, just to hear presidential
    guest Harry Hopkins loudly invoke the second person of the Holy
    Trinity as his head unexpectedly intersected the upper coaming while
    traversing one of these bridges &ndash; rather than being able to
    merely step over the lower coming &ndash; as he proceeded to a
    Wardroom bridge game one evening.)</p>
  <p class="western" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; orphans: 0; widows: 0; page-break-before: auto">
    <br/>

  </p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">There was even a
    small elevator to facilitate the president&rsquo;s access to the
    communications deck (which was awninged and sort of served him as a
    &ldquo;front porch&rdquo;). There were also many special security
    and communications features which had to be installed and carefully
    and fully tested. It just wouldn&rsquo;t look very good on the
    fitness report of anyone whose gear failed in the service of the
    president. Finally, and this is perhaps the ultimate tip-off as to
    the VIP quotient of our coming guest, Tuscaloosa was issued a full
    complement of a dozen brand-new, first-run motion pictures &ndash;
    this at a time when any ship was lucky to get even one good &ldquo;B&rdquo;
    movie &ndash; which always seemed to feature Ann Miller tapping her
    way from horizon to horizon.</p>
  <p class="western">I had then been aboard for a grand total of 160
    days, was a junior Engineering Watch Officer, and served as the &ldquo;A&rdquo;
    Division Officer. As it turned out, the latter position was the
    engineering billet which afforded the most frequent intimate
    glimpses of the presidential party. There are four shipboard
    engineering divisions: &ldquo;A&rdquo; &ndash; for auxiliaries
    (which included such things as the refrigeration plant for
    perishable stores, the ship&rsquo;s steering gear, the various
    repair shops, the evaporators for providing the ship&rsquo;s fresh
    water, and all the ship&rsquo;s small ship-to-shore boats); &ldquo;B&rdquo;
    &ndash; for boilers, the oil-burning sources of all shipboard power,
    &ldquo;M&rdquo; &ndash; for the main propulsion machinery; and &ldquo;E&rdquo;
    &ndash; for all the electrical apparatus aboard. It was due to my
    &ldquo;A&rdquo; Division responsibility that early one morning,
    attired in dungarees and a sweat shirt, I was the proud coxswain of
    the president&rsquo;s barge in Hampton Roads, Virginia. There I was
    with Chief Machinist&rsquo;s Mate Gregory (who knew more about small
    diesel-driven boats than any man I ever met), shaking the barge down
    in the most thorough test imaginable. (My first command at sea, and
    only 22 years old!) I only wish someone could have snapped a picture
    of me at the wheel. I must have been wearing an ear-to-ear grin that
    would have made Eisenhower look like a grouch. But, so far as I can
    recall, this was to be the one and only time the barge was to be
    swung out and lowered to the water. The president never used it. But
    back to our story&hellip;</p>
  <p class="western">After clearing the harbor at Miami, the two
    escort destroyers, Mayrant and Trippe, took anti-submarine screening
    positions off the starboard and port bows, and course was set for
    Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, via the Old Bahama Channel at a speed of 27.5
    knots. We held course and speed through a smooth sea all through the
    night and the fourth of December dawned sunny and clear. During the
    forenoon two navy patrol planes, a part of the Neutrality Patrol
    forces operating from the Guantanamo Naval Base, zoomed low over our
    three ships to establish our identity. I was readying myself for the
    afternoon (1200 to 1600) watch as junior Engineering Watch Officer.
    I was still under instruction at this time, being subject to a fully
    qualified Engineering Watch Officer. The latter were mainly seasoned
    Warrant Officers, up from below ranks, and like most blacks today,
    they had to be better than almost everybody else just to get their
    warrants. Mine, Chief Warrants Schumacher and Young, were the best.</p>
  <p class="western">You didn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;stand&rdquo; watch
    with these guys, they had you tracing out every pipe and cable that
    transited the engine room, and constantly prodded you into
    fine-tuning throttles, temperatures, pressures, and fuel oil sprayer
    plates to achieve maximum possible efficiency. But there was never
    any question but that the &ldquo;sack&rdquo; was mine. They merely
    stood by in the event of foul-ups to give advice after action was
    completed. But even beyond fouling-up, as I say, the emphasis was,
    in automobile parlance, to get more miles to the gallon than any
    other Watch Officer. This was still nominally peacetime, and
    attaining an imaginary &ldquo;E&rdquo; for engineering excellence
    was still an all-hands&rsquo; rate, the end of every engineering
    officer&rsquo;s rainbow, despite termination of formal competition.
    We were doing well, too. My fitness report for the quarter
    immediately preceding the presidential cruise includes the following
    notation: &ldquo;This vessel recently successfully made a Full Power
    Run and has consistently steamed in a most efficient manner for
    which he [namely, your author] is accorded his share of the credit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">So, it was with great anticipation that I slid
    down the accommodation ladder handrails shortly after launch to
    demonstrate my superb engineering proficiency for no less than our
    Commander in Chief. It was an exhilarating moment, but only a
    moment. Imagine my chagrin upon beholding the following note
    attached to the log as I relieved the watch:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">FOR THE ATTENTION OF THE AFTERNOON
    ENGINEERING WATCH OFFICER &ndash; During the afternoon a
    presidential party will be fishing from the fantail. You will
    personally maintain direct communication with his party via 1JV
    (telephone) maneuvering circuit (which will also be monitored by the
    Officer of the Deck), and you will MANEUVER THE MAIN ENGINES IN
    RESPONSE TO THE PRESIDENT IN THE EVENT HE GETS A STRIKE!<br/>
    &ndash;s/
    F.M. Slavin, Engineering Officer.</p>
  <p class="western">I couldn&rsquo;t believe it! I was first dismayed
    and then outraged. Imagine! Here we had a 10,000-ton heavy cruiser,
    around 600 feet long, and &ndash; well, we were serving as a
    120,000-horsepower fishing platform! It crossed my mind that Drew
    Pearson, the sensationalist whistle-blowing columnist predecessor of
    today&rsquo;s Jack Anderson, could really have a field day with this
    little item: &ldquo;President cavorts on fishing holiday in vitally
    needed warship as Hitler&rsquo;s warships harass bankrupt Britain&rsquo;s
    coastal defenses!&rdquo;</p>

    Route of USS Tuscaloosa during 3-14 Dec 1940 with FDR<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote21anc" href="#sdendnote21sym"><sup>21</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">In any event, at 1315 speed was reduced to six
    knots as we steamed along the south coast of Cuba, 500 yards from
    shore and inside the 15-fathom curve, as President Roosevelt,
    Admiral McIntire, General Watson, and Captain Callaghan trolled from
    the stern. (This was the same Callaghan who was to die in the U.S.S.
    San Francisco on 12 Nov 1942 in the naval battle of Guadalcanal. His
    courageous sacrifice there saved Henderson Field, from which our
    airplanes sank 11 troop-laden transports the next day. This battle
    marked the transition of American efforts from defense to offense.
    FDR remarked that the turning point had at least been reached.
    Churchill labeled it &ldquo;the end of the beginning.&rdquo;) The
    only fish caught all afternoon was a 4-pound barracuda by Admiral
    McIntire, but it was hailed as probably the first fish caught off a
    vessel as large as the Tuscaloosa underway, suggesting that big
    moving ships don&rsquo;t frighten fish. But the whole episode
    disheartened at me. I recalled the earlier byplay with the press as
    to whether the trip was a working trip or a vacation. At this point
    the answer seemed crystal clear &ndash; Nero was fiddling again. I
    didn&rsquo;t give the matter any further thought, however, until
    some 15 or 20 years later.</p>

      Leahy on </b></font></font>Tuscaloosa, 22 Dec 1940<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote22anc" href="#sdendnote22sym"><sup>22</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">Our eldest daughter, Anne, was then about 12
    years old, when she similarly became quite outraged (as did a large
    part of the American Press) when President Eisenhower held a rather
    important press conference over the Pro Shop at Augusta National
    Golf Club. &ldquo;Hideous&rdquo; is the word I recall that she used
    to describe the incident. This prompted me to think back to this 4
    Dec 1940 fishing expedition, and I wrote a story about it that
    merited at least a personal (rather than pre-printed) rejection from
    the &ldquo;First Person Award&rdquo; editor of Reader&rsquo;s
    Digest. It recounted memories of president Hoover in hip boots
    casting at Rapidan, Harry Truman&rsquo;s poker sessions, and then
    detailed the foregoing tale about FDR. The point of my story was to
    the effect that the presidency was an incredibly crushing job, and
    that our presidents are well entitled to any respites they can beg,
    borrow or steal to ease its demands. I then concluded the Tuscaloosa
    odyssey with: &ldquo;And who could have foretold that this was to
    occur, almost a year to the day before the &lsquo;Day which will
    live in infamy&rsquo; which was to plunge us into a war which would
    sap the strength and then take the very life of our Commander in
    Chief? Let us leave our presidents to their relaxations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">And so the fighting continued. A presidential
    party again fished from the fantail while underway on the tenth of
    December. For this, one could either thank or curse Ernest
    Hemingway, who had telegraphed the tip that many big fish have been
    caught in Mona Passage, a 1500-foot trench that separates Puerto
    Rico from Santo Domingo. Hemingway even suggested the bait: pork
    rind on a feathered hook. So it was that speed was reduced at 1000
    to 7 knots, while the president once again trolled from the stern.
    Though he stuck with it more than an hour, the president didn&rsquo;t
    so much as get a strike, so the operation was discontinued at 1130,
    and a speed of 25 knots resumed.</p>
  <p class="western">Then there were three separate occasions when a
    presidential party fished, while an anchor, from the forecastle. The
    first such episode occurred off the Navidad Bank, about 55 miles
    northeast of Santo Domingo, late in the afternoon of 10 Dec. Admiral
    McIntire and Harry Hopkins joined the president in this venture,
    with McIntire once again being the only one to get lucky, landing a
    2-pound grouper. This drill was repeated late in the afternoon of 12
    Dec, just off the southern tip of Long Island in the Bahamas. Pa
    Watson caught a 2-1/2-pound red snapper, and Dan Callahan landed a
    mango snapper weighing in at slightly over pound. But once again
    Admiral McIntire didn&rsquo;t come up empty-handed, even though he
    only managed to get 1/2-pound bass. Just before sunset the president
    hooked a very large fish, and played it for almost two hours on a
    line that proved too light, as it finally parted and the fish
    escaped. We&rsquo;ll leave the third forecastle fish-out until a
    little later in this story, but by now you might suspect who the big
    winner was once again.</p>
  <p class="western">By far the most fishing, however, was done from
    Tuscaloosa&rsquo;s small motor whaleboats; and these, you will
    remember, were in my custody. To fully appreciate what a harrowing
    experience this was, I first must explain a little about how all
    these boats operate. They all had sea-water-cooled diesel engines.
    This little technical parley involved two headaches. First of all,
    the diesels used compression ignition rather than spark plugs, and
    more often than not they would fail to start due to the fuel system
    becoming &ldquo;pressure bound&rdquo; on either the high- or
    low-pressure side. The latter eventuality was just complicated
    enough to utterly confused neophyte boat engineers, even though both
    entailed simple &ldquo;venting&rdquo; procedures.</p>

    Departing Hampton Rhodes, VA<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote23anc" href="#sdendnote23sym"><sup>23</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">The second problem was infinitely worse and
    longer-lasting, although no less annoying to erstwhile passengers.
    This was the sudden seizing of the engine when the cooling system
    became sand-clogged from overlong operations in shallow waters.
    (Once, on an extended stay in Guantanamo Bay, we had so many boats
    in overhaul simultaneously due to this problem that we actually had
    to borrow the liberty boats from other vessels in the harbor. The
    clogging could result from stupid coxswains as well as non-alert
    engineers, and expansion to a two-ocean Navy had already resulted in
    an abundance of undertrained recruits as veterans were drained off
    to commission new-construction ships.) Given this background, one
    can imagine how the responsible officer sweated it out every time
    the president left the ship in a small boat. Of course I always made
    sure that Chief Gregory, himself, served as the president&rsquo;s
    boat engineer. (The only other cardiac arrest situation of like
    magnitude was that of the &ldquo;E&rdquo; Division officer when the
    president attended shipboard movies &ndash; as FDR did five times.
    Movie machines seemed uniquely subject to <i>Murphy&rsquo;s Law</i>
    &ndash; if something can go wrong, it will &ndash; but even these
    failures didn&rsquo;t potentially endanger the president like a boat
    failure could.)</p>
  <p class="western">As it turned out, Mr. Roosevelt resorted to our
    small boats no less than half-dozen times: on Dec 5, 6, 7, 10, 11,
    and 13. (This could have been the start of my early transition to
    gray hair!) Turning the President of the United States, and a
    crippled one at that, loose in the open sea in a small boat presents
    many problems other than that of the reliability of the boat itself.
    For example, it requires the provision of several other accompanying
    boats. One has to be completely fitted out, each trip, with portable
    radio sending and receiving equipment, qualified radiomen and
    signalmen, and all the associated code books. (The ship&rsquo;s
    Chief Quartermaster also manned the bridge throughout the
    president&rsquo;s absence from the ship, continuously &ldquo;fixing&rdquo;
    the present exact location on relevant charts.) Again, there was an
    accompanying &ldquo;medical boat,&rdquo; complete with Chief
    Pharmacist and all feasible emergency medical equipment. (One story
    had it that the Chief Petty Officers who served as the president&rsquo;s
    radioman, pharmacist, and so on, were so special that they were
    called &ldquo;Master Radioman&rdquo; and &ldquo;Master Pharmacist,&rdquo;
    which gave rise to surreptitiously referring to the President&rsquo;s
    Chief Boatswain &ndash; who assisted him on his fishing forays &ndash;
    as the &ldquo;Master Baiter.&rdquo;) And spread through all of the
    boats you had your inevitable Secret Service personnel. Nor is that
    all. A special rack had to be fitted in the president&rsquo;s boat
    for his ever-present a mineral water, and we had to fashion a
    special sandbox in his boat as well &ndash; Fala&rsquo;s head!</p>
  <p class="western">Mention of the Secret Service brings to mind
    another item, probably apocryphal, which might even have happened on
    one of the earlier presidential trips in Tuscaloosa, for I didn&rsquo;t
    witness it personally. It seems that one of the agents was lolling
    in the sun on the fantail one afternoon when he overheard
    unmistakable threats to FDR&rsquo;s well-being. A big brute of a
    man, &ldquo;Swede&rdquo; Bjork, was allowing as how His Almightiness
    had better get off his ship real soon, because his presence was
    really getting to him, and something just had to give, and soon.
    Swede was one of those guys who looked belligerent even when he was
    in the most jolly of moods, which was most of the time. Naturally,
    the Secret Service man had to follow up on this, and he did. It
    seems that Swede had been in the Navy beaucoup years, but he had
    never been forced to wear shoes at sea until the president came
    aboard. This intolerable situation and the resulting threatening
    remarks were conveyed to FDR, so the story goes, and it soon
    developed that Swede became the only man in the Navy who could boast
    a special proclamation signed by the Commander in Chief which
    authorized him to go shoeless whenever the ship was at sea.</p>
  <p class="western">Now you may wonder why I clutter this recital
    with such stories, since they may not immediately seem really to
    relate to me and my life story. But they do. First of all, they were
    experiences which I actually encountered precisely as I have set
    them down here. Also, they testify to the up-beat, adventuresome,
    almost frolicsome cast of my early days in the pre-war Navy, a day
    all too soon to be &ldquo;gone with the wind&rdquo; of war. In
    addition, I&rsquo;d have to say in retrospect that these stories
    gave the real flavor of what were perhaps some of the happiest days
    in my life, and which were certainly my happiest Navy years. Of
    course, even then I had my bad days too, just as not all the
    president&rsquo;s time on this trip was one big fishing holiday. But
    he also worked, often and hard, though his opponents and much of the
    press persisted in characterizing his insistence that it was &ldquo;an
    inspection trip&rdquo; as &ldquo;merely pretense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">In any event, his working achievements (as I hope
    to make clear) certainly and considerably outstripped his dismal
    fishing accomplishments. And indeed, most of his work did relate to
    the specific task at hand, the personal inspection and evaluation of
    potential naval base sites as acquired in exchange with Britain for
    50 over-age destroyers on 2 Sep 1940. The British desperately needed
    these craft to enhance their detection and neutralization of the
    German submarine threat, which Churchill then correctly perceived as
    the prime threat to England&rsquo;s lifeline. Checking out feasible
    Caribbean bases was the president&rsquo;s first concern at every
    stop on what was to be a 3,545-mile, 14-stop journey completed in a
    mere 11 days.</p>
  <p class="western">The president set the pattern at our very first
    stop in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Shortly after we anchored he conferred
    with the Commandant of the Naval Station, the Commandant of the
    Marine detachment, and the senior medical officers of the base.
    Together they went over plans for the expansion of the base then in
    progress. Similarly, at Kingston, Jamaica, we took aboard the
    Governor General, and then cruised some 36 miles to the southwest,
    to Portland Bight, where together they inspected a proposed fleet
    base. After the departure of the Governor General, who was returned
    to Kingston via the destroyer Mayrant, the president and Captain
    Callaghan took to a whaleboat to inspect the locality at closer
    hand. Again, at both Port Castries, St. Lucia, and off
    Fort-de-France, Martinique, the president conferred at length about
    the local facilities and conditions. Discussions with the Governor
    of the Windward Islands at St. Lucia touched upon aviation
    facilities, water supply, barracks, subsistence of personnel, and
    unsanitary conditions. These were not mere cursory inspections or
    perfunctory discussions, either. They were skillfully pursued by an
    Ex-Secretary of the Navy and led to action decisions. And at St.
    Lucia, the president again followed up with a detailed inspection of
    the inner harbor from a motor whaleboat.</p>
  <p class="western">Fort-de-France, of course, was another story, it
    then being the strongest Vichy outpost in the Western Hemisphere.
    There, consultants with the president comprised only our local Naval
    Observer and his boss, the United States Consul. An added fillip at
    this point, however, was the presence of the French Aircraft carrier
    Bearn. It&rsquo;s safe to say that every telescope and pair of
    binoculars aboard Tuscaloosa were focused on this formidable
    potential enemy throughout our layover outside the harbor. And then
    we were off to a similar conference with the Governor of the Leeward
    Island at Antigua. An indication of the no-nonsense nature of these
    inspections is typified by the consequences of a morning-long survey
    of the southern coast of Mayaguana Island in the Bahamas a short
    while later. This precipitated the following dispatch from the
    president to the Secretary of the Navy: &ldquo;Please hold in
    abeyance all negotiations for use of an installation on Mayaguana
    Island. No anchorage for surface vessels in northeast trades such as
    we experienced that locality.&rdquo; But the most dramatic shipboard
    working conference was still to come.</p>
  <p class="western">This main event was first tipped off when the
    president invited &ldquo;the three musketeers&rdquo; who constituted
    the press pool traveling in Mayrant to come aboard for the day,
    hinting that &ldquo;something quite interesting would probably occur
    aboard Tuscaloosa.&rdquo; A short while later, a giant 4-motored
    Navy patrol plane out of Miami landed close aboard, only to
    disembark His Royal Highness, the Duke of Windsor, the former
    British King Edward the VIII (whose abdication in 1936 prompted some
    wag to remark on the greatest demotion in the annals of naval
    history, from Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy to 3rd Mate of an
    American tramp.) I was lined up with the officers on the Quarterdeck
    as the crew of the Tuscaloosa manned the rails. I will never forgets
    the shock of seeing him. He was exceedingly pale, and of shriveled
    skin, with an uncommon profusion of bags under the eyes. Altogether,
    he looked emaciated and dissipated, and I wrote home at the time
    that we should not be surprised if he died before the year was out,
    as he certainly looked weak and sick. This little prediction was off
    by a mere 32 years.</p>
  <p class="western">In any event, the Duke, who was then Governor of
    the Bahamas, met for slightly more than two hours with the
    president. They discussed both his problems and the common problem
    of choosing a location for a United States naval base in the
    Bahamas. The duke then graciously submitted to an interview by &ldquo;the
    three musketeers,&rdquo; at which he generously indicated that
    &ldquo;whatever the president wants, we will give him the best we
    have.&rdquo; After he departed the president continued working as he
    too spoke at length with the press. I&rsquo;ll cover his remarks in
    some detail precisely to underscore the work dimension of this
    too-often-called &ldquo;holiday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">The president pointed out that the need for
    numerous bases to serve as Atlantic outposts embraced for more than
    just the defense of the Panama Canal, such bases being vital to the
    defense of the United States, Central America as a whole, and South
    America. The president emphasized that the farther away from the
    American continent a potential attack can be kept, the safer it is
    for the continent itself. The president stated that with a little
    dredging an excellent harbor could be had at the Jamaica base site,
    that the St. Lucia and Antigua sites were quite satisfactory,
    although the proposed base at Mayaguana was by no means
    satisfactory, because of the absence there of a lee and an
    anchorage, a ship seeking to anchor being either in a thousand
    fathoms or on the beach. It was remarked that even though some of
    the locations were mainly for aircraft bases, supplies would still
    have to be brought in by ships. In closing, the president also
    sketched some of the highlights of his talks with the British
    officials he had conferred with during the past few days. Looking
    back, the real miracle was that the president found any time to
    relax, let alone fish. This is the way it was Friday, the
    thirteenth, at Miller Anchorage, Eleuthera Island, Bahamas, B.W.I.
    But, &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t heard nothing yet!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Yet another aspect of the president&rsquo;s
    working commitment was the regular delivery of White House mail
    pouches by Navy patrol planes operating out of San Juan, Puerto
    Rico. They made deliveries and pick-ups at Beata Island on the 6th,
    Antigua on the 9th, and West Caicos Island on 11 Dec 1940. The short
    turn-around time of the plane demanded the immediate and
    concentrated attention of the president. Nor was this merely routine
    domestic correspondence. Rather, it proved to be momentous in its
    enduring international and historic impact. The prime example of
    this would be the letter initiated by Churchill on 7 Dec (but
    ultimately dated on the 8th due to time-zone extension incident to
    its delivery.) This letter was no less an international bombshell
    than the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor exactly one year later. (It
    would be well-nigh frivolous at this point to even suggest that
    since the day was spent approaching, at, and departing Aves (<i>Bird</i>)
    Island, that 7 Dec was sort of historically &ldquo;for the birds,&rdquo;
    so this temptation will be suppressed. (A touch of litotes is always
    welcome.) But the fact remains that Aves Island is a small,
    low-lying island that is uninhabited &ndash; except that it serves
    as a breeding ground for thousands of seabirds. Actually, it is
    little more than an exposed reef in the Caribbean about 135 miles to
    the west of a point about half-way between Dominica and Guadaloupe
    Islands.)</p>
  <p class="western">This was to be the scene of the biggest fishing
    catch of the entire trip. This seems only fitting in that it also
    turned out to be the most important work day of the trip, as we
    shall presently explain. In any event, President Roosevelt, General
    Watson, Captain Callaghan, and the redoubtable Admiral McIntire
    fished from the forecastle. While the president managed to land only
    a half of a red snapper, the admiral hauled in a 3-pound snapper, a
    4-pound trigger fish, and a jack weighing 6 pounds. Meanwhile, Harry
    Hopkins had taken a whaleboat to fish closer to the shore. This
    proved to be a shrewd move, for he caught an 8-pound grouper, the
    largest catch of the journey.</p>
  <p class="western">The biggest triumph of the day, however, had to
    be the aforementioned letter authored by Churchill, which arrived by
    patrol plane off Antigua on 9 Dec. It should be remarked that this
    date represents a virtual midpoint of the year spanning the fall of
    France on 22 Jan 1940, and Hitler&rsquo;s invasion of Russia on 22
    June 1941; a period which Churchill&rsquo;s memoirs described as one
    in which &ldquo;the British people held the fort &ndash; ALONE &ndash;
    until those who had been hitherto half blind were half ready!&rdquo;
    This historic letter, which the Prime Minister himself characterized
    as &ldquo;one of the most important letters I ever wrote,&rdquo; was
    a five-page, nineteen-point letter of about 4,000 words. Whereas up
    until Nov 1940 the British had paid for everything received, they
    were now down to their last two billions, which readily comprised
    not readily saleable investments.</p>
  <p class="western">In the letter Churchill described Britain&rsquo;s
    dire plight, and warned of the impending moment when England would
    &ldquo;no longer be able to pay cash.&rdquo; He spotlighted critical
    problems in production and shipping, the twin dangers of bombings
    and U-boats, ask for more destroyers by either gift or loan, and
    saved a few blunt words on Britain&rsquo;s perilous financial plight
    for the last paragraphs. He cautioned that divesting Britain of all
    of its saleable assets would cause cruel predations in Britain which
    could spill over into widespread unemployment in the United States
    after the war. He concluded by reminding the president that the
    defeat of the Hitler was a matter of prime consequence to the people
    of the United States and of the entire Western Hemisphere, but
    expressed confidence that FDR would find &ldquo;ways and means&rdquo;
    to cope with the crisis.</p>
  <p class="western">This the president could do and did &ndash; on
    board Tuscaloosa between 9 and 11 Dec 1940. Son Elliott testifies
    that &ldquo;Before Tuscaloosa reached home port, he had invented
    what he first called &lsquo;Lend-Spend.&rsquo;&rdquo; Of this period
    Hopkins said later, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know for quite a while
    what he was thinking about, if anything. But then, I began to get an
    idea that he was refueling, the way that he so often does when he
    seems to be resting and carefree. So it didn&rsquo;t ask him any
    questions. Then, one evening, he suddenly came up with it &ndash;
    the whole program.&rdquo; Churchill corroborates this in his own
    memoirs, &ldquo;Harry Hopkins &hellip; told me later that Mr.
    Roosevelt read and re-read this letter as he sat alone in his
    deck-chair, and that for two days he did not seem to have reached a
    conclusion. He was plunged in intense thought, and brooded
    silently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Historian Warren Kimball tells us that &ldquo;From
    Whitehall to Washington men eagerly awaited the decision that could
    only be made by Franklin Roosevelt,&rdquo; and goes on to pin-point
    the moment of decision: &ldquo;In 1944 Churchill told &hellip; that
    Roosevelt had sat with the letter all day (9 Dec) after it arrived,
    and then sought no one at all the next day (10 Dec.) Then the
    following day (11 Dec) he came up with the Lend-Lease idea &hellip;
    and Hopkins states that Roosevelt told him of the concept two days
    after the receipt of Churchill&rsquo;s letter.&rdquo; This day, 11
    Dec 1940, was spent in transit from Navidad Bank via West Caicos to
    Mayaguana Island in the Bahamas, a day otherwise marked only by a
    brief fling at fishing, the arrival of another White House mail
    pouch via Navy patrol plane, and the disappointing survey of
    Mayaguana. More significantly, perhaps, this was also the evening
    FDR attended a movie featuring Carole Lombard and Charles Laughton
    which had the trenchant title &ldquo;They Knew What They Wanted.&rdquo;
    Most assuredly both Churchill and Roosevelt certainly did.</p>
  <p class="western">Why the big deal about Churchill&rsquo;s letter
    and the resulting evolution of Lend-Lease? Well, Churchill labeled
    it a &ldquo;new Magna Carta &hellip; <i>the most unselfish and
      unsordid &hellip; act of any country in all history.</i>&rdquo;
    Kimball marks as &ldquo;the point of no return for American policy
    regarding Hitler&rsquo;s Germany.&rdquo; Joseph Stalin said that it
    was &ldquo;one of the president&rsquo;s most remarkable and vital
    achievements &hellip; in keeping the Allies in the field against
    Hitler.&rdquo; What it did was provide a program of military aid by
    the United States to opponents of the Axis Powers, and kept the
    Allied cause alive and fighting on all fronts for the two years
    needed by the United States to become a decisive force in actual
    combat.</p>
  <p class="western">Lend-Lease gave the president unprecedented power
    to &ldquo;sell, lease, lend, exchange with or make available in any
    other way to the government of any country whose defense the
    president deems vital to the defense of the United States, any
    defense article,&rdquo; and further provided that any repayment to
    the United States might be &ldquo;in kind or property or any other
    direct or indirect benefit which the president deems satisfactory.&rdquo;
    There was no provision for repayment. Can you imagine any such
    blank-check legislation today! No, but you can take pride in the
    fact that this nation&rsquo;s magnanimity stemmed the tide of
    fascism, for Lend-Lease was the catalyst in the quick conversion of
    American industry to defense production, and according to Kimball,
    marked &ldquo;the creation of the most productive and co-operative
    coalition in modern times &ndash; the Anglo-American alliance
    against Nazi Germany.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">How was it all done? After all, then current
    polls revealed that only 30% of U.S. citizens believed that Allied
    victory was even possible. FDR introduced the idea to the American
    public in a press conference on 17 Dec, at a time when, according to
    speech-writer Robert Sherwood, &ldquo;It still seemed he had spent
    two weeks in a state of relaxation and indifference [aboard
    Tuscaloosa, of course] toward the prospects of world calamity.&rdquo;
    He began with characteristic under-statement (a thing Nixon surely
    never learned), starting off with &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there
    is any particular news,&rdquo; but then went on to assert that to
    his mind &ldquo;the best immediate defense of the United States is
    the success of Britain in defending itself.&rdquo; He continued by
    observing that some people thought we should lend money to Britain,
    and that others thought we should deliver war materiel as an
    outright gift, but that he felt such thinking was &ldquo;banal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Of course very few people, indeed, thought any
    such thing, but it would serve to convince almost anyone of what a
    reasonable middle-of-the-roader he was. Then he came to the heart of
    the matter, contending that what he sought to do was to &ldquo;get
    rid of the silly, foolish, old dollar sign,&rdquo; and went on to
    spin the fantasy of his now famous &ldquo;good neighbor&rdquo;
    analogy: &ldquo;Suppose my neighbor&rsquo;s house catches fire, and
    I have a length of garden hose&hellip; If he can take it and
    connected up &hellip; I may help him to put out the fire&hellip; I
    don&rsquo;t say to him before [that], &lsquo;Neighbor, my garden
    hose cost me $15; you have to pay me $15 for it.&rsquo;&hellip; I
    don&rsquo;t want $15 &ndash; I want my garden hose back after the
    fire is over&hellip;&rdquo;<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote24anc" href="#sdendnote24sym"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
  <p class="western">According to Sherwood, &ldquo;It may accurately
    be said that with that neighborly analogy, Roosevelt won the fight
    for Lend-Lease.&rdquo; And Sherwood continues, &ldquo;One can only
    conclude that Roosevelt, a creative artist in politics, had put in
    his time [during the cruise in Tuscaloosa] on evolving the pattern
    of a masterpiece.&rdquo; An ensuing poll showed 71 percent favored
    his proposal and an amazing 54 percent favored immediate action.</p>
  <p class="western">The president followed up on this <i>tour de
    force</i> with his equally famous speech of 29 Dec which pleaded for
    support in making the United States &ldquo;the great arsenal of
    democracy,&rdquo; and parlayed this with his 6 Jan message to
    Congress which not only introduced his proposed Lend-Lease
    legislation, but coupled it with his plea for his famous <i>four
      freedoms</i> &ndash; of speech and religion, and from want and fear.
    As a final Rooseveltian fillip, we somehow got the legislation
    introduced as H.R. <i>1776</i>, a veritable &ldquo;declaration of
    the inter-dependence.&rdquo; The ensuing debate has been variously
    characterized (Sherwood&rsquo;s superb &ldquo;Roosevelt and
    Hopkins,&rdquo; and Warren Kimball&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Most Unsordid
    Act&rdquo; proved excellent references) as the &ldquo;bitterest
    debate in American history,&rdquo; and as &ldquo;one of the most
    spirited and important debates in the history of American foreign
    affairs.&rdquo; Pop&rsquo;s views are elaborated in a document
    incorporated in the Congressional Record by Senator Hiram Johnson of
    California on 6 Mar 1941. <i>Pop was against it!</i></p>
  <p class="western">The administration based its case on national
    security, noting that with the loss of the British fleet the
    Atlantic would provide no security. The opposition view was anchored
    on the twin fears of eventual deployment of Americans on European
    battlefields and the vesting of potential dictatorial powers in the
    president. No effort by even the most ardent supporter of Lend-Lease
    was made to defend it in terms of traditional interpretations of
    international law. Secretary of State Hull sought some vindication
    on the pretext of asserting that Germany and Italy were
    international law breakers and noting that international law
    provided no protection for Belgium, Holland, Norway and Denmark, and
    therefore only the law of self-protection was left to the United
    States. In response to a specific question in executive session,
    Hull went so far as to state that a breakdown of international law
    justified the application of the doctrine of self-defense. Secretary
    of War Stimson went even further, referencing a statement of the
    <i>International Law Association</i> on the Kellogg-Briand Pact
    which branded the Axis as law-breakers and justified such
    legislation as Lend-Lease.</p>
  <p class="western">Needless to say, Pop was adamantly opposed to
    such a legalistic flights of fancy. He pointed out that the proposed
    act represented &ldquo;a complete reversal of the (U.S.) position of
    the past six years,&rdquo; citing our neutrality laws of 1935, &rsquo;36,
    &rsquo;37, and &rsquo;39, and the Spanish Embargo Act of 1937. He
    additionally cited relevant provisions of the Johnson Act of 1934,
    the Criminal Code, The Hague Convention, and the so-called Budapest
    Articles of Interpretation re the Kellogg-Briand Pact distorted by
    Stimson. He stressed that &ldquo;there is no stage between
    belligerency and neutrality,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;there have been
    no violations of the neutrality rights of the U.S. by Germany
    alleged by proponents&rdquo; of the pending legislation. In brief,
    Pop contended that the implications of the proposed act were
    &ldquo;contrary to the accepted fundamental rules of international
    law,&rdquo; and therefore &ldquo;one shrinks intuitively from having
    the U.S. sacrifice law observance by committing un-neutral acts
    while at the same time protesting its neutrality, even to secure a
    manifest advantage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Pop did leave an &ldquo;out,&rdquo; however. He
    conceded that &ldquo;an argument might be adduced for the [proposed
    act] from the right to intervene for humanitarian reasons&rdquo; but
    noted that no such argument had been introduced as a consideration
    by proponents of the legislation. This is especially noteworthy in
    the light of 20/20 hindsight of revelations anent the holocaust, and
    affords perhaps the only solution to an otherwise almost insoluble
    moral dilemma. In all events, Pop was in good company. Dr. Robert
    Hutchins of the prestigious University of Chicago declared that with
    Lend-Lease the &ldquo;American people are about to commit suicide!&rdquo;
    Eric Sevareid wondered if it did not involve a fundamental
    dishonesty.</p>
  <p class="western">Finally it should be remarked that in this day of
    intercontinental ballistic missiles, threats to our National
    Security might be said to be always &ldquo;direct and immediate,&rdquo;
    but moral decisions will be no less difficult. Even today it is
    difficult for me to accept the notion that Britain had to fall in
    WWII before we could be said to be sufficiently threatened to assist
    in England in our own self-defense. Pop was, in my opinion, morally
    correct, despite the practical implications of his position. One
    might write a great novel based upon the notion that Lend-Lease
    failed to pass, <i>but</i> (happily) it did pass.</p>
  <p class="western">Lend-Lease was signed into law on 11 Mar 1941, a
    mere 65 days after it was first presented to Congress on 6 Jan 1941,
    Kathleen&rsquo;s birthday. (Contrast this with President Carter&rsquo;s
    drought of more than a year in the field of allegedly urgent energy
    legislation anent the 1970s oil crisis!) But one further insight re
    Lend-Lease is worth remarking. At the last minute an amendment was
    introduced to bar aid to Russia. Catholics, mostly, mounted
    tremendous opposition to the aid for the USSR. FDR, of course,
    insisted that to exclude aid to Russia would amount to an invitation
    to Japan to forage into Southeast Asia. That was the major public
    argument in favor of Soviet aid, but the real reason was U.S.
    fore-knowledge of the German plan to invade Russia, thanks to some
    outstanding code-breaking successes.</p>
  <p class="western">The latter dimension is something we might all do
    well to keep in mind, when we sometimes don&rsquo;t understand
    present day maneuvering in the field of international relations. We
    may very possibly lack some most significant facts. (We might also
    do well not to adhere too rigorously to following blindly the
    admonitions of religious leaders, who too often perceive secular
    affairs via a simplistic moral prism, with a vision that is
    sometimes further clouded by a single-issue conscience and religious
    tunnel-vision.) And remember too, that this highly controversial act
    by FDR was without precedent. Historian Albrecht-Curie underscores
    this by contrasting it with American obstinacy over debts from World
    War I, thus: &ldquo;Eventually, America &hellip; acknowledged
    economic reality, and the skillful device of Lend-Lease used in the
    Second World War was in large part intended to avoid the recurrence
    of the situation and the recrimination that followed the first war,
    that the war was a joint enterprise for a common purpose of equal
    importance to all.&rdquo; As Kimball puts it, FDR had devised &ldquo;a
    give-away program that did not look like one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">It took Churchill, as usual, to put it all in the
    proper perspective. He called it &ldquo;The Third Climacteric&rdquo;
    of World War II. (The first two of which were the fall of France and
    the Battle of Britain. The fourth and fifth were the invasion of
    Russia and the attack on Pearl Harbor.) Sherwood concludes that, &ldquo;It
    was an historic victory for Roosevelt.&rdquo; And though the program
    had been percolating in his mind since at least the preceding
    August, and although he had been inputted by all manner of advisers,
    the fact remains that it was indeed FDR who evolved, integrated and
    forged the ultimate totality, especially its timely translation into
    action. This was the essence of his genius. As Kimball says, &ldquo;The
    plan was novel only in relation to the time, circumstances, and most
    of all the scale (but) &hellip; adding the final link in the chain
    took both imagination and political savvy.&rdquo; The final link,
    and the one that probably sold the whole program, was the idea that
    should the borrowed fire hose be damaged in the fire, then the
    borrower would later replace it. &ldquo;For want of a nail the shoe
    was lost,&rdquo; had been fully redressed at long last.</p>
  <p class="western">As for his timing, the president&rsquo;s fine
    touch would have put even such a recognized master as the great Jack
    Benny to shame. He had an unparalleled gift for never getting too
    far out in front of public opinion, and an equally immense talent
    for artfully contriving to appear to have been virtually pushed,
    despite tremendous personal reluctance, into taking precisely the
    action he had secretly sought to take for very long time. As for the
    scale of it all, how many people today are aware of the fact that
    Lend-Lease poured out over 50 billions of dollars in four years, as
    compared to only 12 billions dispensed over 3-1/2 years through the
    more popularly remembered Marshall plan? Imagine how ludicrous a
    Marshall Plan would have been if Lend-Lease had been denied! But
    then, there would have been no Marshall Plan except for the fact of
    a prior Lend-Lease, because the U.S. would have been numbered among
    the eventual victims of Hitler&rsquo;s expanding tyranny. Make no
    mistake, no less than of this Chapter, FDR was the hero of this
    period in international history.</p>
  <p class="western">And he not only had genius, he had genuine class,
    as was repeatedly demonstrated in the course of his eleven-day
    journey in Tuscaloosa. For example, on the cruise with Jamaica&rsquo;s
    Governor General to Portland Bight, his invitation conspicuously
    included a caveat for informal dress in view of the expected heat of
    the day; and for the associated communication-deck buffet luncheon,
    the invitation embraced the Tuscaloosa&rsquo;s Commanding,
    Executive, Gunnery and Damage Control officers. And as mentioned
    earlier, his entertaining of the Duke of Windsor was preceded by an
    invitation to the accompanying press pool to be on hand, and
    additionally the Tuscaloosa&rsquo;s Commanding Officer and the
    Navigator, plus the Commanding Officers of the two escorting
    destroyers &ndash; this latter being a nice touch indeed. He also
    acceded to the request of Commander Destroyer Squadron Two, in
    U.S.S. Moffett, to join up with the president&rsquo;s escort group
    in the area of St. Lucia, and cheerfully agreed to pose one day on
    the fantail, fishing pole in hand, with all 40 of the Tuscaloosa&rsquo;s
    Chief Petty Officers.</p>
  <p class="western">Two further examples of real class come to mind.
    The very day he received Churchill&rsquo;s historic letter, he still
    found time to honor a previous commitment to join wardroom officers
    for dinner. (In passing, I must confess that this has been my
    uniform experience with truly great and so-called busy professionals
    &ndash; that they always find the time, even make the time, to
    accommodate each and every demand for their attention. Contrariwise,
    show me a person who takes off on the basis of being too busy, and
    I&rsquo;ll show you a disorganized procrastinator who literally
    squanders precious time on trifles.) In any event the president not
    only joined us for dinner, lest senior officers preempt his
    attention, he insisted that an ensign (the lowest of the low, and I
    was among them) be seated to his right, and he even suggested a
    lottery in the interest of fairness.</p>
  <p class="western">I admit I found this both exciting and
    heart-warming, but I didn&rsquo;t win. Nevertheless, I did have a
    ring-side seat for this memorable evening. (As <i>Time</i>&rsquo;s
    Hugh Sidey has said so well, &ldquo;Dinner with Franklin Roosevelt
    was a jewel that sparkled in one&rsquo;s memories through life. He
    brought joy, understanding, wit and grace to the table for all to
    savor.&rdquo;) Just imagine! This was one of the two evenings when
    the world-changing concept of Lend-Lease was crystallizing in his
    mind!</p>
  <p class="western">The final display of class was the president&rsquo;s
    issuance (before he&rsquo;d leave the ship) of a letter of
    commendation to be incorporated into the record of every officer and
    sailor then serving on board. And remember, the president had no
    protocol specialist along to prompt him, and no staff to support him
    in all these niceties. They all had to be his idea from start to
    finish. No less than Churchill, we had all found him to be a &ldquo;good
    neighbor,&rdquo; an excellent neighbor. Perhaps William Douglas sums
    up my sentiment best: &ldquo;FDR gave the nation the kind of
    leadership I admired. We seemed to lose stature and greatness in his
    passing, becoming petty and greedy and small where we had known
    magnanimity, altruism and humanism.&rdquo; As Joseph Alsop summed
    him up so eloquently on the occasion of the one 100th anniversary of
    FDR&rsquo;s birth, &ldquo;He was the unrelenting enemy of misery,
    poverty, oppression, cruelty, injustice, meanness, smallness,
    obscurantism, and every other form of nastiness and source of
    unhappiness that human beings and their societies are given to, and
    he was the stout friend of plenty, generosity, decency, liberality,
    geniality, openness, justice and freedom.&rdquo; And, as if that
    weren&rsquo;t enough, he then adds, &ldquo;&hellip; guts, rational
    optimism, and tough obstinacy about accepting defeat were added in
    full measure to Roosevelt&rsquo;s extreme wiliness, his magical
    sense of political timing, and his remarkable astuteness in avoiding
    showdowns until a showdown was likely to produce a satisfying
    result.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Naturally, no man aboard wanted to see him go,
    but go he did &ndash; on 14 Dec the Charleston Navy Yard in South
    Carolina. Congressman Mendel Rivers was there, together with the
    Governor, to greet him. Exploding flashbulbs and screaming reporters
    at once signaled the end of the so-called vacation. Well, all right,
    let&rsquo;s accept the fact that he did leave us as they said,
    &ldquo;tanned and looking very fit,&rdquo; so some people may always
    view it as a holiday at the height of hostilities. It all reminds me
    of a memo I once wrote to a boss of mine. I entitled it &ldquo;Thoughts
    While Shaving.&rdquo; In due course it was returned to me with the
    added notation, &ldquo;Grow a beard!&rdquo; So be it. If this
    historic trip is to forever be regarded as a mere fishing trip, then
    I suggest we must all persist in inciting our current inhabitants of
    the White House by exclaiming, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go
    fishing!&rdquo; Maybe genius could strike again as it surely struck
    FDR. What a magnificent leader!</p>
  <p class="western">Isn&rsquo;t it strange that we have no national
    monument to this man, who, no less than Washington and Lincoln,
    actually preserved the Union in a very real time of crisis; and this
    despite a crushing physical handicap that would have stopped most
    men before they began? This is all the more deplorable in light of a
    largely politically motivated national celebration of the birthday
    of Martin Luther King, and the almost obscene proliferation of
    memorials to JFK, whose comparable contributions to the benefit of
    world society, at least to me, remain relatively obscure. But, of
    course, Roosevelt <i>does</i> have the finest type of monument, one
    not likely to ever be equaled &ndash; <i>four consecutive terms</i>
    as the Chief Executive of the nation, and at the popular behest of
    the American people! I can only add that I&rsquo;m delighted that I
    had ever so small a share in it all. And I, for one, couldn&rsquo;t
    have agreed more had Churchill chosen to say of FDR&rsquo;s
    incubation of the Lend-Lease concept in the course of his sojourn in
    Tuscaloosa &ndash; &ldquo;<i>This</i> was <i>his</i> finest hour!&rdquo;</p>

      IX. WAR</h2>
  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western">We have acknowledged war as &hellip;
    the ultimate form of competition. War is the father of all things,
    the potent source of ideas, inventions.<span style="font-style: normal">
	&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Will&nbsp;Durant</span></p>
  <p class="western">Now we once again encounter the paradox of the
    seeming parallel between the course of my own life and the temper of
    the times. Jan 1941 marks the peak of the Axis powers&rsquo; thrust
    for world dominance, coming it as it does virtually midway between
    the fall of France (Jun 1940) and the fateful invasion of the USSR
    (Jun 1941); even as the Allied hopes reached their nadir and began
    their upsurge at long last, thanks to the catalytic effect of
    American Lend-Lease. If only Hitler known, his doom was already
    sealed &ndash; the turning point had come. So, too, this period
    ushered in the sealing of my happy doom &ndash; a matrimonial
    alliance with Kathleen. We would eventually wed on 14 Sep 1942,
    after which our separate journeys would become one, but first there
    was some extra-marital fighting to be done.</p>
  <p class="western">Life, and the war, did go on after the robust
    uplifting of the spirit afforded by our brief encounter with the
    charismatic FDR. A mere eight days after disembarking him,
    Tuscaloosa &ndash; with the <i>Stars and Stripes</i> painted atop
    turrets II and III, and with her largest ensign flying from the main
    truck &ndash; was off for Lisbon, Portugal, transporting Fleet
    Admiral and Mrs. William D. Leahy, bound for diplomatic service in
    Vichy, France. The foregoing sentence conveys the entire substance
    of the political history of Tuscaloosa anent this journey which
    concluded some 20 days later in Norfolk, Virginia, but this trip
    marked another major turning point in my life, further reinforcing
    the already remarked congruence of its &ldquo;ups and downs&rdquo;
    with (or its direct contrast to) the flow of international events.
    Seemingly, my life&rsquo;s journey was never &ldquo;in neutral&rdquo;
    with reference to world events. I&rsquo;ve already noted that things
    weren&rsquo;t going too well in the Western World just then, and for
    me especially this was one rough trip. It is no exaggeration to
    state that between the &ldquo;going and coming&rdquo; on this trip
    my life course was literally turned around.</p>
  <p class="western">First of all, as any sailor knows all too well,
    the north Atlantic is never among the more friendly climes in the
    world, and in the winter months of December through March it is
    downright hostile. Wind-whipped outside air temperatures produce
    wind-chill effects which always hover well below zero degrees. Even
    in the normally 120-degree ambiance of machinery spaces, the air
    blowers had to be sharply throttled down. The salt water temperature
    could drop as much as 3-1/2 degrees below freezing. (This provided a
    40-degree contrast with the 50-mile-wide Gulf Stream &ndash; some
    fifty miles off shore and fifty miles wide before it curves slowly
    east and further diffuses just north of Cape Hatteras &ndash; which
    was so sharp that it could be used with confidence as a
    dead-reckoning navigational fix.) It was not only cold and windy,
    daylight hours were short, the sun clouded or fogged out more often
    than not, and the waves were relentlessly and monotonously rough.</p>
  <p class="western">The ship&rsquo;s bow would float upward creating
    a sensation of weightlessness and then plunge hard and deep enough
    to plow green water over the bow. As often as not the water would
    freeze on contact with any and all severely sub-cooled metal
    equipment. At the same time, we&rsquo;d roll some 40 degrees
    side-to-side with constant shuddering and frightening groans. You
    had to hold on, day and night, wedging yourself into your bunk upon
    which special guard-rails to had to be mounted. The galley remain
    secured, and all meals were cold, and generally eaten standing up
    (and holding on), because all tables and chairs had to be lashed
    down. A few days of this and you became mighty weary and envied
    every soul who had never left dry land, and you&rsquo;d wonder why
    you&rsquo;d ever ventured to see. And, I&rsquo;m talking here about
    those who never got sea-sick (which, fortunately, I rarely did),
    which appeared to be a fate worse than death.</p>
  <p class="western">Nor was this the end of it. You must remember as
    German historian Cajus Bekker has noted, that &ldquo;Sep and Oct
    1940 [was the period] when the &lsquo;era of the gray wolves&rsquo;
    reached its zenith.&rdquo; Since we were not yet &ldquo;officially&rdquo;
    at war, combat information was merely &ldquo;restricted,&rdquo;
    which was then the lowest grade of classified material, to which any
    uniformed person had access. Thus it was that I maintained a chart
    on the bulkhead in my cabin of the north Atlantic ocean area, and I
    religiously posted every reported sinking of U.S. military and
    merchant shipping. (Memorable marks were 17&ndash;18 Oct 1941 U-boat
    attacks on USS Kierney and USS Reuben James in mid-ocean out of
    Halifax with a convoy to England. Of these two destroyers, one
    survived and one sank, with a total loss of 126 officers and men.)
    Clearly, gross weather and treacherous ocean elements were not the
    only hazards of north Atlantic operation the winter of 1940&ndash;41.</p>
  <p class="western">Nor were these the only dangers and
    discomfitures. Ships then had to stream paravanes in shoal waters,
    as whenever entering or leaving port. Paravanes are torpedo-shaped
    underwater protective devices with knife-edged teeth at the forward
    end designed to sever the cables securing underwater mines. As ships
    ploughed forward any intercepted mine cable would ride out the
    paravane cable to the cutting blade, where it would be sliced free
    and the mine would then bob to the surface, where it could be
    rendered harmless at a safe distance by rifle or small gun fire.
    This may sound like a good deal, but &ldquo;sound&rdquo; was
    precisely the problem. The paravane cable slicing through the water
    set up a horrendous piercing howl that absolutely precluded all rest
    or sleep for hours and sometimes days.</p>
  <p class="western">Did I mention sleep? What was that? Between the
    pitching and the rolling, with the ship&rsquo;s motion giving its
    best possible imitation of a giant corkscrew, and the pounding into
    the waves, the groaning of the ship itself, the clatter of
    inadequately secured &ldquo;loose&rdquo; gear, the howling of the
    paravanes, the fear of mines, the ever present threat of submarine
    attack, the prospect of freezing in near arctic waters even if
    surviving on foundering &ndash; who slept? The fact is no one ever
    undressed on these trips, and you were afraid to risk being caught
    in a shower and even rushed &ldquo;regular&rdquo; trips to the head.
    You not only stayed fully clothed at all times, you wore your life
    jacket (uninflated, of course) at all times, and carried your gas
    mask everywhere. It was as though you labored under constant siege.
    As Eric Sevareid<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote25anc" href="#sdendnote25sym"><sup>25</sup></a>
    has noted, &ldquo;There was no more sleep &ndash; only brief
    blackouts when the mind became unconscious, the body remaining
    alert. The sleep of wartime, which the minds and bodies of millions
    were to learn and practice for years to come.&rdquo; Indeed!</p>
  <p class="western">And for responsible engineering officers afloat,
    this alertness was made more acute by a well-honed awareness of the
    slightest deviation of machinery sounds. One became instantly alert
    to the most minimal fluctuation propeller RPM, as occasioned by the
    necessity to keep tight position in fleet or convoy formations. The
    engineer noted the rising whine of forced-draft boiler blowers as
    they were accelerated to &ldquo;blow tubes&rdquo; in the darkness of
    the night, a process wherein live steam was jetted on the firesides
    of boiler tubes to dislodge the accumulated carbon deposits from
    combustion and flow them up and out the stack, thereby enhancing
    heat transfer efficiency.</p>
  <p class="western">The engineer came second only to the navigator to
    note the sounding of the foghorn, and equally as troubled. The
    navigator worried about collision; the engineer worried about the
    loss of the precious boiler feed water as each sounding of the horn
    released gobs of pure steam to the atmosphere. This meant already
    over-burdened evaporators (never designed for the actual wartime
    inflation of ship&rsquo;s crew-size as occasioned by unexpected
    technical developments such as radar and degaussing gear) would have
    to work even harder and longer. The engineer was alert, too, to the
    popping of boiler safety valves, and the &ldquo;kicking in&rdquo; of
    diesel-driven emergency electric power generators. He heard sounds
    in the night beyond those of any other shipboard member.</p>
  <p class="western">Is there any exaggeration here? Not the
    slightest! In his memoirs, &ldquo;I Was There,&rdquo; our
    distinguished passenger, Fleet Admiral Leahy &ndash; surely an
    experienced seaman &ndash; noted that, &ldquo;A half gale was
    blowing from the northwest on Christmas Day and our dinner had to be
    served on individual trays. We opened our Christmas presents on a
    long settee (bolted securely to the deck!) while bracing ourselves
    against the heavy cruiser&rsquo;s violent motion.&rdquo; Did he say
    &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; cruiser? Yes! And though Tuscaloosa was a heavy
    cruiser, the &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; refers to the caliber of its main
    battery guns (3-triple 8&quot; gun turrets), rather than the ship&rsquo;s
    displacement. Nevertheless, she did carry 14&quot; armor plating. I
    felt very secure behind these bulkheads despite the loss of several
    of our destroyers in the area. After all, everyone knew that
    destroyers were &ldquo;tin cans.&rdquo; So, as I just said, I felt
    very secure &ndash; well, up to a point.</p>
  <p class="western">That point came on the night of 9 Aug 1942. This
    was the battle of Savo Island in which the Japanese demolished four
    heavy cruisers within 32 minutes. Three of these cruisers were
    sister ships (replicas) of Tuscaloosa. My sense of security fled
    completely with receipt of the report of this battle. As a
    consequence of this tragedy, in which follow-on fires played a major
    part, our meticulously well-kept wooden deck was ripped out stem to
    stern, every bulkhead throughout the ship was chipped clean of all
    paint down to bare steel, every inch of deck linoleum was scraped
    clean off, and all upholstered wardroom furniture was immediately
    off-loaded for the duration. So, the relentless drone of
    around-the-clock chipping hammers was then added to the already
    considerable din of shipboard living, and few places could be found
    for even a moment&rsquo;s comfortable relaxation. Hey! It still beat
    sharing a half-flooded foxhole with rats!</p>
  <p class="western">While I began with mention of our special mission
    to Lisbon, the conditions reported thus far pertained, of course, to
    sea-going in general during this so-called last year of &ldquo;peace&rdquo;
    for the U.S. After all, too, we were streaming paravanes through
    U-boat infested waters long before any GI&rsquo;s were in foxholes,
    wet or dry. And should you be tempted to deprecate the submarine
    threat, I beg you to recall the Churchill himself testified that,
    &ldquo;The only thing that ever really frightened me during the war
    was the U-boat peril&hellip; I was even more anxious about this
    battle than I had been about the glorious air fight called the
    Battle of Britain.&rdquo; In any case we eventually arrived in
    Lisbon, totally exhausted. Leahy was disembarked immediately, and
    four days of liberty were to be granted (alternating port and
    starboard watch sections, of course) before heading home. That is,
    liberty was to be granted to all except this young engineering watch
    officer.</p>
  <p class="western">Tuscaloosa&rsquo;s had been on the go constantly
    for several months now, and so this four-day layover had to be
    seized as an opportunity to clean both the fire and water slides of
    half of our 8 boilers. This grimy and grueling operation entails
    completely opening up the fireboxes and setting crews to working
    inside the firebox, snaking rods and chains through the tube banks
    to literally beat the hard carbon deposits off the tubes. Meanwhile
    all waterside headers and drums were opened to enable the removal of
    scale deposited on the inside of tubes incident to the evaporation
    process &ndash; the conversion of water to steam. (Incidentally, the
    difference between a drum and header is that a man can actually get
    into a drum. This might suggest to some why sailors sometimes
    classified women one way or the other.)</p>
  <p class="western">Why all the detail? Well, first of all, to
    indicate to some younger unbelievers that indeed there was a time
    when I worked for a living. More importantly, it is necessary
    background to any understanding of what happened next, and why I did
    the stupid thing that I did, and which, as I&rsquo;ve already noted,
    effectively turned my life around. The facts are that the boiler
    cleaning necessarily entailed the follow-on tedium of running
    hydro-static tests on each boiler (to ensure against leaks after
    reclosing), and then actually getting up steam and running up the
    pressure so as to actually &ldquo;pop&rdquo; and correctly re-set
    all safety valves. As you might imagine, this operation consumed the
    better part of 3 nights and 3-1/2 days, such that the possibility of
    liberty in Lisbon for me didn&rsquo;t come up until the very last
    afternoon in port. Upon disembarking FDR, I had coincidentally been
    rotated from the &ldquo;B&rdquo; to the &ldquo;A&rdquo; division for
    training purposes. So it was that on our final afternoon in port, I
    went topside with two of my engineering officer shipmates (Ensigns
    Howard Hickman and George Babb, both of whom had previously been
    ashore &ndash; I alone then being assigned to the boiler division),
    to catch a motor launch to my first and probably only liberty in
    Lisbon.</p>
  <p class="western">Upon arriving on the Quarterdeck, the OOD, a wimp
    named Dinwiddie (whom the crew appropriately dubbed <i>Dimwittie</i>)
    confronted us. Though we were all together, this insipid little
    Lt.(jg) addressed only me &ndash; &ldquo;Wright! Whereinhell do you
    think you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo; I meekly replied, &ldquo;On my
    first liberty at last in Lisbon, sir!&rdquo; &ldquo;The hell you
    are!&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the Exec just told me to get somebody
    to make a courtesy call on the (newly arrived) Coast Guard cutter,
    Campbell, and you&rsquo;re it!&rdquo; Just then Dinwiddie&rsquo;s
    attention was diverted by some commotion on the other side of the
    quarterdeck, and at the excited urging of my two shipmates, I was
    easily expedited down the accommodation ladder onto a waiting the
    liberty boat. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll easily get somebody else,&rdquo;
    they assured me, &ldquo;and you can explain later how this was your
    last and only chance to get ashore. Besides, he hadn&rsquo;t yet
    really given you any specific orders.&rdquo; (Easy for <i>them</i>
    to say!)</p>
  <p class="western">And so I began a really great liberty in Lisbon,
    which at that time was, as a neutral city, a city of great
    excitement and intrigue where officials of even contesting nations
    could and did freely mingle. It was there that I bought my first and
    only pair of hand-crafted leather boots &ndash; a Lisbon specialty.
    (I didn&rsquo;t like them &ndash; too cumbersome &ndash; and later
    gave them away.) I also purchased another Lisbon specialty, three
    delicately filigreed replicas of Columbus&rsquo;s galleon in full
    sail, one for Kathleen, one for my mother, and one for my sister.
    All in all, it was a great day &ndash; up to a point.</p>
  <p class="western">Upon returning to the ship I was accosted by two
    large and menacing Marines (replete with sidearms) and advised by
    the then-OOD that I was under arrest. I was next hustled by the
    Marines to the Captain&rsquo;s quarters. There a stern and serious
    C.O. ordered me to deliver my sword to him forthwith and advised
    that I was suspended from all duty for five days for disregard of
    official orders, and should consider myself under room arrest. Did I
    have anything to say? Hardly. Well, I thought to myself, at least I
    could relax on the trip home. No way. The second day out I was
    released in response to the urgent need for qualified Engineering
    Watch Officers, but it was made clear that the full five-day
    suspension would remain a matter of my official record. Great! The
    authorities had their cake and yet ate it &ndash; and it was my butt
    that they were chomping. Now, you might think that was the end of
    that, but I knew better.</p>
  <p class="western">It occurred to me immediately during my one-day
    sojourn of stateroom incarceration that this little incident marked
    the end of my naval career. There was no doubt in my mind that a day
    would come &ndash; undoubtedly when I could least afford it,
    somewhere between the ages of 30 and 40 &ndash; when a board would
    be selecting candidates for commander. There would be 5-to-10 times
    as many qualified applicants as available billets. Hence, they would
    have to weed out the list unmercifully and drastically. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;
    I could imagine the board saying, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s one for the
    trash bin, a guy with a five-day suspension for disregard of
    official orders!&rdquo; It would all be that simple &ndash; and that
    inevitable. This was <i>the</i> turning point in my would-be
    military career. Thenceforth my career thinking was wholly civilian
    oriented.</p>
  <p class="western">Knowing my propensity for planning, it shouldn&rsquo;t
    surprise you that I immediately set about developing a specialty
    appropriate to civilian life. This was early 1941, remember, and it
    occurred to me that perhaps the two most engineering-oriented fields
    of potential development were plastics and air-conditioning. The
    former offered no shipboard opportunities for learning, while the
    latter did, and hence I opted for air-conditioning. At that time A/C
    was available only to movie houses which &ldquo;beat summer&rdquo;
    by advertising &ldquo;20 degrees cooler inside,&rdquo; and I figured
    that this would really be a burgeoning field after the war. At that
    time A/C was so new and limited in its application that the closest
    affiliated professional society was the <i>American Society of
      Refrigerating Engineers</i> &ndash; which I promptly joined.</p>
  <p class="western">I also started playing shadow to our heating
    systems honcho, CMM Rowley, who additionally maintained all of our
    refrigerated scuttlebutts (drinking fountains). When he wanted a
    special dual gauge enabling virtually simultaneous checking of &ldquo;hi&rdquo;
    and &ldquo;lo&rdquo; pressure sides, which wasn&rsquo;t on our
    authorized ship&rsquo;s allowance list (because it was so &ldquo;new&rdquo;)
    I got him one by direct purchase. I also hung out sufficiently in
    our ice plant (which maintained all our refrigerated stores spaces)
    that one morning when CMM Batten was late in showing up, I &ldquo;lit
    off&rdquo; the plant single-handedly. From then on, I was learning
    all I could about A/C.</p>
  <p class="western">Meanwhile, turning back to the home front, this
    is the appropriate point, I think, to digress to what I consider one
    of the most enlightened (an unheeded) speeches my Pop ever made. He
    made it there for the 44th annual meeting of the <i>American Academy
      of Political and Social Science</i>, in Philadelphia, on 5 Apr 1941.
    I&rsquo;m largely indebted for my information on this to a report
    appearing in the <i>Washington Post</i> of 6 Apr 1941, and
    headlined: &ldquo;Dr. Wright Warns Against Policing World.&rdquo; It
    is poignantly amusing to note that the great Walter Lippmann was
    some years later to be credited with coining the phrase re &ldquo;world
    policeman&rdquo; anent U.S. foreign policy. (Whoever gets the
    credit, it&rsquo;s too bad we never paid more attention to the
    concept!) Anyhow, speaking some eight months before Pearl Harbor,
    Pop said, &ldquo;It is idle to prate of peace and non-intervention
    and no entangling alliances, but the United States should not seek
    to be <i>the policeman of the world</i>.&rdquo; Pop indicated that
    policing the world would commit us to perpetual war.</p>
  <p class="western">Turning to the situation then threatening in the
    Far East, Pop noted that &ldquo;Speaking merely in terms of dollars
    and cents, Japan has been and will continue to be one of our best
    customers, as we have been hers. Hence all unnecessary hostility to
    her should be avoided and a sympathetic attempt made to understand
    her peculiar problems.&rdquo; Pop continued, &ldquo;An enlightened
    foreign policy could and should make allowance for some Japanese
    economic penetration of nearby lands in order to give Japan outlets
    which she needs.&rdquo; Pop concluded, &ldquo;A <i>military</i>
    Japanese Monroe Doctrine would be a serious threat to the peace of
    the Pacific &hellip; but a form modeled on our own is not
    unthinkable.&rdquo; Just imagine how different the course of history
    might have been if only our leaders had heeded Pop&rsquo;s advice!
    For one thing, I may never have gotten to the Pacific because the
    Japanese might never have descended on Pearl Harbor. But this wasn&rsquo;t
    to be.</p>
  <p class="western">But for the rest of January through July,
    Tuscaloosa was essentially engaged in off-shore Atlantic coast
    neutrality patrol, with a collateral mission of giving a series of
    newly commissioned ROTC &ldquo;90-day&rdquo; Ensigns a shake-down
    cruise. About this time (it was on 16 Jul 1941, actually) I applied
    for enrollment in the engineering correspondence course conducted
    for junior officers by USNA PG school, even though I conceded I was
    ineligible. The request, of course, was denied, but this initiative
    still had to look good on my record. In fact, I went further, as my
    &ldquo;fitness report&rdquo; for this period attests: &ldquo;Though
    barred by his rank from enrolling in the correspondence course in
    engineering, he has obtained a copy of said course and is proceeding
    with self-instruction.&rdquo; As appreciators of George&rsquo;s
    music will realize, he was a pretty good at self-instruction, too.
    Wonder where he got that?</p>
  <p class="western">In any event, during this period only two breaks
    in the monotony of the routine occurred. The first break was a
    two-day layover in Bermuda for alleged recreation. My only liberty
    there came on 8 Apr 1941. A one-page letter from me to my parents
    and salvaged from my mother&rsquo;s archives tells the story.
    Rather, it <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> tell the story at all, but let me
    introduce the letter itself before elaborating. It is on Tuscaloosa
    stationary, and datelined Saturday, 12 Apr 1941 (four years to the
    day before my Pop died.) Thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Hello folks &ndash; Well, here we are in
    Newport, R.I. I decided to get my summer house here all straightened
    out, just like I fixed up the one in Bermuda on Wednesday. In
    Bermuda I went ashore and had a pretty good time. First I hired a
    bike for $1.00. (There are no autos in Bermuda, you know.) Boy, I
    rode all over the island &ndash; which, though beautiful, is greatly
    over-rated. Not as good as Madeira by a long shot &ndash; quite a
    fizzle of a joint, I thought. Bought myself a red necktie there &ndash;
    and had a few Planters Punches (the drink for which the island is
    famous). They were really excellent. One of the guys had a camera
    and so I&rsquo;m in quite a few pictures &ndash; and I&rsquo;ll try
    to get some for the scrapbook if he ever has &rsquo;em developed.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Well, back to Newport, which &ndash; if you
    remember my letters of second-class cruise &ndash; is famous, as far
    as I&rsquo;m concerned, only for the apple pie a-la-mode, which I
    intend to enjoy tonight &ndash; if I get ashore.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Expect to be in the Navy Yard again
    starting 17 Apr. Don&rsquo;t know for how long. Oh, yes &ndash;
    Bermuda is British &ndash; full of war posters, etc. Very
    interesting.</p>
  <p class="western">Now that all seems straightforward enough, but in
    fact, it is as sanitized and misleading as a Ron Ziegler White House
    Press briefing. Here&rsquo;s what really happened in Bermuda. It was
    a blazing hot and clear sunny day. We did hire bikes (me and
    engineering buddies of Lisbon fame &ndash; Ensigns Hickman and
    Babb), and did pedal all over the island. And we didn&rsquo;t merely
    sample a few Planters Punches, we stopped for one at virtually every
    bar we passed, and Bermuda had more bars than the D.C. jail.
    Beaucoup hours later, the last thing I remember is the three of us
    roaring down a hill, screaming like wounded banshees, wildly waving
    our &ldquo;torches&rdquo; (which is proper English, don&rsquo;t you
    know, for required post-sundown-biking &ldquo;flashlights&rdquo;),
    thereby causing some astounded Bermudans then emanating from an
    evening movie to scramble for safety in all directions. I have no
    idea what happened to my bike, and the rest of this story (until
    &ldquo;Church Call&rdquo; at 1000 the following day) is pure hearsay
    on my part. It seems I was carried out of the liberty boat and
    tucked into my bunk aboard ship by a 6'4&quot;-tall Marine corporal.</p>
  <p class="western">I next awoke the following morning to the bugle
    announcing 1000 Sunday Mass. Quick as a whip I was up and dressed
    and off to Mass in the hangar. I was told that I was white as sheet
    and still weaving. I can vouchsafe that I felt like I was going to
    die. I barely made it back to my cabin when my roomboy, a huge black
    fellow named, appropriately enough, &ldquo;Knight,&rdquo; brought in
    a formidable platter of hot cakes and sausage (which was <i>never</i>
    standard wardroom fare), plus a huge pitcher of hot black coffee.
    This was a guy who had a reputation as one mean, knife-wielding SOB
    who (like many other misfits) had been specifically assigned to me
    because &ldquo;Wright really knows the secret of dealing with them.&rdquo;
    He simply said, &ldquo;I saw you at Mass, Mr. Wright, and I thought
    you could use this!&rdquo; It probably saved my life. I would not
    have dared to venture into the wardroom, and couldn&rsquo;t have
    made it if I tried. But, true to the axiom of &ldquo;if you really
    feel terrible, then stuff yourself,&rdquo; I devoured everything in
    sight, and immediately was on the road to recovery.</p>
  <p class="western">There were several consequences of this quite
    accidental debauchery via potent &ldquo;punches&rdquo; exacerbated
    by the blazing hot sun. First, I got an embarrassing lecture from
    the Chaplain, who had heretofore held me up as his prize exhibit &ndash;
    this being the same one who would later teach me how to serve at
    daily Mass. Then, later, I got a more formal but quite understanding
    admonition by the Gunnery Officer, who happened to be the same SOA
    (Senior Officer Aboard) that evening, about how I had a good record,
    a promising future, and I should never let anything like that happen
    again, etc., etc. It didn&rsquo;t! (It never occurred to me until
    now, as I write some 43 years later, that on both of these occasions
    I might have been, in effect, set up by my two &ldquo;reserve&rdquo;
    buddies. I wonder???) Finally, forever after, I was always greeted
    by every Marine aboard with an over-enthusiastic &ldquo;How are you
    doing <i>today</i>, Mr. Wright?&rdquo; to the accompaniment of a
    huge grin. Little wonder that I sanitized my letter home, even as
    Kathleen and I now learn from time to time how our children, in
    their turn, have often spared us worrisome details. (Thanks, kids!)</p>
  <p class="western">The second break during the spring of 1941 was
    more of a professional nature &ndash; diversion of Tuscaloosa to
    participate with the British in the search to destroy the great
    42,000-ton battleship Bismarck. Accompanied by the cruiser Prinz
    Eugen, the Bismarck had slipped into the Atlantic in mid-to-late
    May, bent upon a surface raiding mission. After several intermittent
    en route spottings, she was locked-in by the radar of HMS Suffolk at
    1922 on 23 May in the Denmark Straits, that bitterly cold and always
    violent body of water which separates &ldquo;a snow-white&rdquo;
    Greenland from a Gulf-Stream&ndash;warmed &ldquo;perennially green&rdquo;
    Iceland. Suffolk was soon joined by her sister cruiser HMS Norfolk.
    The battle cruiser HMS Hood and the battleship Prince of Wales were
    summoned via the Admiralty in London to close on the targets. The
    latter, in fact, sighted the Germans at 0535 on the morning of 24
    May and opened fire in 0553. The Germans returned fire at 0555 and
    six minutes later HMS Hood was gone! Prince of Wales immediately
    broke off the action and Bismarck and Prinz Eugen didn&rsquo;t
    pursue.</p>
  <p class="western">It was this sinking of the Hood and the
    subsequent retirement of the Germans into the North Atlantic mists
    which resulted in the employment of Tuscaloosa in the follow-on
    search to relocate Bismarck. Tuscaloosa&rsquo;s had been patrolling
    from Bermuda to the Cape Verde islands (off Dakar, at the west-most
    bulge of Africa), and the call caught her in port between sorties
    with much of the crew on liberty. The emergency was considered so
    dire that a &ldquo;scratch&rdquo; crew was hastily put together
    consisting of men from sister-ship cruisers Vincennes and Quincy,
    augmented by a group of V-7 reserve ensigns then attached to
    Tuscaloosa for a training cruise. Tuscaloosa headed north, even as
    it was presumed Bismarck and &ldquo;friend&rdquo; would head south
    to wreak havoc on merchant shipping. It should be noted that German
    raiders had accounted for the loss of more than 115,000 tons of
    merchant shipping in the central Atlantic in the period of Jan to
    Mar 1941 alone. Of course the British soon polished off Bismarck by
    themselves, even as Prinz Eugen escaped, and so Tuscaloosa was
    released to resume its semi-dangerous but boring neutrality patrols
    a mere three days later.</p>
  <p class="western">The passing of Bismarck and should be further
    elaborated, however, because this event changed not only the
    complexion of Atlantic operations in general, it altered the further
    deployment of Tuscaloosa, which was then dispatched for duty in the
    north Atlantic &ndash; or more specifically, in the horrendous
    Denmark Straits &ndash; but this story comes later. The thing to
    remark about the termination of Bismarck is that, like so many land
    and sea battles of WWII, it was a comedy of ineptitude on the part
    of commissioned officers on both sides. Sad to say, this recurring
    theme is too often unremarked in discussions of present-day weapons
    systems and war plans. You can load soldiers and sailors up with
    technological marvels galore, and the outcome of confrontations will
    still turn on the balance of ineptitude among the contending
    officers!</p>
  <p class="western">In the case at hand, the British radar gave them
    the advantage of surprise, but they first squandered it by closing
    at an angle so tight they could only bring their forward guns to
    bear, thereby sacrificing half their firepower. Secondly, the
    British then squandered their initial bursts on the lesser threat.
    Thirdly, they only partially rectified this error by then adjusting
    fire to disperse it between the two targets rather than
    concentrating on their prime target. (It might be further noted that
    the Germans had interchanged the positions of their two ships during
    the night. It should be further remarked that this fortuitous switch
    by the Germans was not the result of genius, but the simple
    recognition that the concussion of Prinz Eugen&rsquo;s guns when she
    was in the lead distorted Bismarck&rsquo;s forward radar scan.)</p>
  <p class="western">Notably, when the Germans opened fire, it was
    concentrated on the formidable battle-cruiser Hood, and they made
    short work of it, indeed. But then, the Germans erred by not
    pursuing the Prince of Wales when she broke off the action. The
    reason for this dismal decision was the classic one: &ldquo;I was
    only following orders!&rdquo; Actually, the German Admiral Lutjens
    prided himself on strict adherence to official orders, and his
    orders were that his mission was merchant targets, not military
    ones. True, Bismarck trailed a tell-tale oil leak as a result of a
    hit by Prince of Wales, and so Lutjens did arrange a separation from
    Prinz Eugen which ultimately enabled her escape. At the same time
    his withdrawal foreclosed all chance for a two-for-one parley.</p>
  <p class="western">Nowhere was that the end of the errors. The
    British actually lost radar contact, but Lutjens didn&rsquo;t
    realize this, and so he kept radio transmissions going to the German
    Admiralty, thereby enabling British D/F (direction-finder equipment)
    to relocate him. Then (can you believe this?), the British
    misinterpreted their D/F readings and took off to the north, away
    from Bismarck! H.M.S. Ark Royal from the Gibraltar Force then came
    on the scene &ndash; and immediately her planes bombed H.M.S.
    Sheffield! Fortunately, she scored no hits. Finally, the second wave
    from Ark Royal disabled Bismarck&rsquo;s steering gear, leaving her
    a sitting, circling duck for the three hours it took the torpedo
    bombers to finish her off. This is one melee I&rsquo;m glad
    Tuscaloosa was spared.</p>
  <p class="western">The Bismarck sinking marked the end of the German
    surface raiders ranging through the south Atlantic, and the focus
    shifted north. At the same time with Barbarossa (the invasion of
    Russia) being launched on 22 Jun, the focus of the European land war
    shifted from the west to the east (and incidentally freed the
    northern flank of the Japanese, inviting their subsequent
    penetration of Southeast Asia.) So it was that on 8 Aug 1941
    Tuscaloosa embarked three important persons: General Hap Arnold,
    Chief of the Army Air Force, whom Joseph Alsop salutes as &ldquo;without
    peer for his tough concentrated intelligence, and crafty courage&rdquo;;
    Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner, Navy Chief of War Plans, who warned
    Pearl Harbor <i>on 5 Feb 1941</i> of a potential disaster, and who
    Morrison labels &ldquo;a practitioner of amphibious warfare second
    to none&rdquo;; and then-Captain Forrest Sherman (later a CNO), who
    Morrison avers is deserving of &ldquo;a special accolade&rdquo; as
    one of the Navy&rsquo;s &ldquo;top planners&rdquo; in his capacity
    as Nimitz&rsquo;s Chief of Staff.</p>
  <p class="western">We were off to Argentina where FDR was to meet
    Churchill on 15 Aug 1941 for the formulation of the <i>Atlantic
      Charter</i>. En route we joined up with heavy cruiser USS Augusta in
    which the president was then embarked. We then joined the HMS Prince
    of Wales (which was sunk in Malaysian waters only four months later)
    in which Churchill was embarked at Argentia, Placentia Bay,
    Newfoundland. This was another of the British bases passed to us as
    payment for our transfer of 50 over-aged destroyers in Sep 1940.
    According to author William Manchester, Placentia Bay is &ldquo;one
    of the most desolate places in the world,&rdquo; and it was from
    here slightly over one year later that I would fly to Boston and
    thence &ldquo;train&rdquo; to DC for my wedding.</p>
  <p class="western">The <i>Atlantic Charter</i> was a joint
    Anglo-American declaration of principles modeled on Wilson&rsquo;s
    <i>Fourteen Points</i> and Roosevelt&rsquo;s <i>Four Freedoms</i>.
    Its terms were subsequently incorporated in the first declaration of
    the United Nations&rsquo; charter. Was not formally signed, but
    merely mimeographed. As author T.R. Tehrenbach wryly observed,
    &ldquo;Roosevelt could not yet give Churchill all he asked for &ndash;
    the U.S. Navy, the Air Force, and millions of American fighting men
    &ndash; but he could commit the power of American principle &hellip;
    which Churchill accepted with delight.&rdquo; It was released on 14
    Aug 1941 (and at virtually the same time that the U.S. Congress
    extended the selective service act by <i>a mere one-vote margin.</i></p>
  <p class="western">Robert Sherwood states, &ldquo;Its effect was
    cosmic and historic.&rdquo; At the same time, and a matter of no
    small importance, this event marked the first face-to-face wartime
    conference between Roosevelt and Churchill. Churchill reported to
    the Lord Privy Seal, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I have established warm
    and personal relations with our great friend.&rdquo; It was also
    during this time that the Navy commenced the nighttime practice of
    darkening ship, which was to constitute the totally blacked-out
    condition of all sea-going ships until shortly after V-J Day<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote26anc" href="#sdendnote26sym"><sup>26</sup></a>
    some four years later. Somehow &ldquo;darken ship&rdquo; seemed a
    proper response to Argentia, which qualified well for Gertrude
    Stein&rsquo;s famous description of Hollywood &ndash; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
    no there, there!&rdquo; Nevertheless, the <i>Atlantic Charter</i>
    did put Argentia on the world map for all time. It <i>was</i> an
    historic occasion.</p>
  <p class="western">Henceforth Tuscaloosa was ever on the move,
    totally absorbed by the sweep of wartime events. Immediately upon
    our return from Argentia we conveyed the Under Secretary of State,
    Sumner Welles, to a conference in Portland, ME. Pausing only
    briefly, Tuscaloosa then steamed northbound to overtake the first
    American troop convoy bound for duty in Iceland (strategically
    important as a great-circle viaduct from North America to England),
    which we had occupied on 4 Sep 1941 and which Morrison marks as the
    start of &ldquo;a de facto state of war.&rdquo; Then, with the
    reorganization of the Atlantic Fleet, Tuscaloosa receive new orders
    &ndash; assignment to a Task Group also comprising Wichita,
    Mississippi (BB 41), Idaho (BB 40), and New Mexico (BB 42), and two
    destroyer divisions. This became the &ldquo;Denmark Strait Patrol.&rdquo;
    Under the two-starred flag of RAdm. Robert Giffen, in Wichita,
    Tuscaloosa became an element of the &ldquo;White&rdquo; Patrol based
    out of the wind-frenzied and frozen &ldquo;Valley Force, North&rdquo;
    that was Hvalfjordur, Iceland.</p>
  <p class="western">Cruising northward of Iceland (since the Denmark
    Straits had been mined), Tuscaloosa and her consorts pounded back
    and forth on dull and cold patrol duty. This was truly miserable
    duty, and the threat of contact with and possible destruction by the
    enemy was perhaps the least of it. As Morrison tells it, &ldquo;between
    Newfoundland, Greenland, and Iceland is the roughest part of the
    western ocean in the winter. Winds of gale force, mountainous seas,
    biting cold, body-piercing fog and blinding snow squalls where the
    rule rather than the exception. The continued rolling and pitching,
    coupled with the necessity for constant vigilance night and day &ndash;
    not only for enemy attack, but to guard against collisions with
    other vessels (in the formation) &ndash; wore the men down.&rdquo;
    The so-called rest periods at Hvalfjordur &hellip; were rests merely
    from enemy attack, not from the weather; for, &ldquo;the holding
    ground was bad and the weather (with fierce winds) terrible.&rdquo;
    Amen! More often than not we had to set an underway steaming watch
    even in port, with steam up to the main engine throttles, and
    turning over the main propulsion turbines of every 20 minutes. Often
    we even had to sustain a few revolutions per minute on the
    propellers to avoid dragging anchor and being driven ashore by
    frigid winds and fierce currents.</p>
  <p class="western">The approach of war, however, was never far from
    our minds. We had been nearby when the destroyer Greer exchanged
    depth charges with unsuccessful torpedoes from the U652 on 4 Sep,
    when Reuben James was torpedoed and sunk with loss of American life
    on 31 Oct, and when the destroyer Kearney and the tanker Salinas
    were damaged by torpedoes in the area on 17 Oct and 30 Oct &ndash;
    all well before Pearl Harbor. The earlier events, taken in the
    overall context of the fast-deteriorating world situation, have let
    FDR to issue an order to &ldquo;shoot (any submarine) on sight&rdquo;
    on 4 Sep.</p>
  <p class="western">A short time later, on 7 Oct 1941, I had served
    Mass for the very first time in my life at age 23. I had long been
    Chaplain Mehling&rsquo;s only regular weekday Mass-attender (the
    altar was his stateroom bunk), so we both agreed that it would be
    neat if I&rsquo;d learn the necessary moves and Latin to assist him
    as server. My main job was to hold onto the candles for dear life
    (as he did the chalice), to prevent their being flipped by the
    motion and relentless rolling and pitching of the ship. On 5 Nov
    1941, together with Wichita, we stripped ship with for action in
    response to the rumored escape of the Nazi warship Tirpitz (sister
    ship to the powerful Bismarck) and the Prinz Eugen from the relative
    safety of Norwegian fjords to threaten shipping lanes to Britain and
    north Russia. It was probably very lucky for us that the expected
    enemy foray never materialized.</p>
  <p class="western">During this period in late 1941 and carrying
    through 1942 we alternated and with other U.S. and British cruisers
    in monitoring the patrol in and north of the Denmark Straits against
    such threatened sorties by heavy units of the German navy. After
    all, this was the route previously taken by Bismarck and Prinz
    Eugen. Submarines were always active in the area, contacts by
    accompanying destroyers were frequent, and the ocean was never
    quiet, but no surface activity was encountered.</p>
  <p class="western">Norway-based long-range German reconnaissance
    planes were also a constant threat. I&rsquo;ll never forget
    Thanksgiving Day (27 Nov 1941), when we spent the entire day
    responding to and securing from anti-aircraft stations. (These
    stations differed from &ldquo;General Quarters&rdquo; battle
    stations in that the main battery 8&quot; turrets were not involved,
    the ostensible target of our 5&quot; and 20- and 40-mm batteries
    being either enemy aircraft or submarines.) I remember we sat down
    to a turkey dinner at least half-dozen times and never once got to
    take bite number one. (We finally ended up eating cold turkey
    sandwiches at anti-aircraft stations.) A rather comic if potentially
    lethal aside here was our gunnery control disarray. I can remember
    (being sealed in the engineering spaces well below the waterline)
    taking great comfort in hearing our guns open up on the assumed
    airplanes, only to hear the gunnery dudes guffawing over wardroom
    coffee afterward how they totally screwed up, firing harmlessly into
    the water out of an anti-submarine set-up rather than shifting into
    an anti-aircraft set-up. Really make you feel secure &ndash; <i>like
      hell!</i></p>
  <p class="western">It was also during this period that I acquired my
    <i>Bluenose</i> certificate attesting to my first crossing of the
    Arctic Circle on 22 Aug 1942. Actually we made eight crossings in
    October, 18 in November, and more in December. It was a damn cold
    winter. On the positive side, there were the in-port visits to the
    wardrooms of our British cousins at &ldquo;tea&rdquo; time, where
    one could down several warming gin-and-lime-juices. Limes, of
    course, had long been a seafarer&rsquo;s staple &ndash; for scurvy,
    you know &ndash; and &ldquo;the gin was added merely to make it
    palatable.&rdquo; In any event, this practice sure beat hell out of
    the dull, dry wardrooms of the U.S. units. This should also explain
    why the Britishers are sometimes called &ldquo;limeys.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">On 7 Dec 1941, some 360 Japanese planes, from six
    carriers which had departed the Japanese home islands on 22 Nov,
    shattered the Sabbath silence in a surprise attack on 86 ships
    anchored in sunny Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Tuscaloosa was at that
    historic instant resisting the dragging of its anchor during a
    wind-swirling snow storm at Hvalfjordur, Iceland. We were &ldquo;out
    in the cold&rdquo; in every way as Pearl Harbor was finding things
    very hot, indeed. It was already dark when we got the first word on
    returning from the evening movie in the hangar. (Daylight at that
    latitude that time of year is scarcely six hours long.) We had
    noticed a steady trek of communication-shack personnel to the C.O.
    in the front row throughout the movie. In fact, the C.O. and his
    heads of department left the hangar long before the movie was over.
    When we hit the wardroom, the reason was plain to see. A new
    bulletin board had already been installed. Its first message was a
    real shocker:</p>
  <p class="western" align="center">AIR RAID, PEARL HARBOR &ndash;
    THIS IS NO DRILL!</p>
  <p class="western">A short time later this was added:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">First estimates indicate Arizona and
    Oklahoma sunk, possible severe damage to Nevada, California, and
    West Virginia. Considerable damage to several cruisers, destroyers,
    repair ships and amphibious craft!</p>
  <p class="western">There were no details, AND these critically
    significant statistics were sent &ldquo;in the clear&rdquo;! This
    fact alone gives a tell-tale indication of the real degree of chaos
    already reigning on that faraway scene &ndash; <i>seven important
      capital ships out of commission within the first hour of
      hostilities!</i></p>
  <p class="western">The new bulletin board turned out to be a
    superfluous gesture. An information blackout (at first self-imposed
    aboard Tuscaloosa) descended almost immediately thereafter. This
    startling Pearl Harbor SOS turned out to be the <i>first</i>, <i>last</i>
    and <i>only</i> information about what was really going on with
    which we were to be favored during the entire course of the war.
    Thereafter, we participated in many wartime events, but we never had
    any idea what was going on or what we were involved in until we read
    about it long after the war was over. It was as reported in an
    earlier war by British historian Alexander Kinglake:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Each separate gathering of English soldiery
    went on fighting its own little battle in happy and advantageous
    ignorance that any great conflict was raging.</p>
  <p class="western">Perhaps now you&rsquo;ll pardon my occasional
    lengthy digression into minute details. You have to understand that
    this very narration represents my first realization and clear
    understanding of what I was actually doing during those years! Only
    much later would we know that 2,403 Americans were killed in Hawaii
    that Sunday morning, while another 1,178 Americans were wounded, at
    a cost to the Japanese of only five torpedo bombers, one dive
    bomber, and three Zeros from the first of the two waves. The second
    wave lost an additional 14 dive bombers and six Zeros &ndash; still
    an amazingly <i>cheap shot</i>. It is edifying in the light of this
    tragic situation to note that of 300&ndash;400 bed patients in the
    Naval Hospital that day, virtually every patient able to walk had
    voluntarily left to return to his ship prior to the serving of
    evening supper! Meanwhile, Tuscaloosa fueled at midnight in a
    blinding snowstorm and then sat aimlessly in harbor until a
    &ldquo;refresher cruise&rdquo; was ordered on 6 Jan 1942. Thus, the
    net effect of an actual state of war as regards Tuscaloosa was
    initially a considerably more tranquil existence.</p>
  <p class="western">Before leaving this passing reference to events
    transpiring almost on the other side of the world, it might not be
    out of place to sum up the lessons of history on this &ldquo;day
    that will live in infamy&rdquo; (which, incidentally, it really
    never did become). I&rsquo;ve read a very great deal of literature
    on the subject, including the &ldquo;Monday-morning analyses&rdquo;
    of some formidable so-called military minds. Nevertheless, the two
    most penetrating analyses of the tragedy have, to my mind, been the
    work of two civilian authors. The first is Gordon Prange, late
    professor of history at the University of Maryland, whose
    posthumously published 738-page treatise, &ldquo;At Dawn We Slept,&rdquo;
    is generally conceded to be the definitive account of Pearl Harbor.
    He concludes, &ldquo;We cannot stress too strongly that all the
    American failures and shortcomings which contributed to the Japanese
    victory at Pearl Harbor stemmed from the root disbelief that the
    Japanese would undertake the risky venture&hellip; This fundamental
    disbelief is the root of the whole tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">There can be no question about this.
    Nevertheless, I believe this evaluation might better be termed the
    proximate cause of the disaster. There is, I believe, a much more
    subtle underlying cause which one-time columnist Joseph Alsop
    elucidates most effectively: &ldquo;What had gone wrong? The answer
    is beyond question. All Americans, markedly including officers of
    the armed services, were only too aware of the political limitations
    on the President&rsquo;s freedom of action. Thus they made the
    cardinal error of supposing that the Japanese would see their own
    problems as those problems were seen by American eyes.&rdquo; Amen!</p>
  <p class="western">Even as the Japanese Supreme War Council adopted
    a war plan on 6 Sep 1941 which provided for first, prior to a
    declaration of war, destruction of the U.S. Pacific Fleet,&rdquo;
    Alsop continues, &ldquo;the officers who prepared our 11 Sep 1941
    estimate for the Joint Intelligence Board, and the service chiefs
    who signed it, and Roosevelt himself who received it, all gloomily
    foresaw that the President would probably be unable to respond
    except with gestures if the Japanese seized the rich prizes to be
    had in Southeast Asia and the Dutch East Indies. Hence they fully
    expected the Japanese to do what they were obviously able to do with
    near impunity. But they <i>never</i> expected the Japanese to make
    the militarily classic move of removing the American threats to
    their exposed Pacific flank, for <i>they did not regard these
      threats as real because of the political limitations on the
      President</i>&rdquo; (my emphasis added). It is fascinating to
    observe that these political limitations still pertain as I write in
    late 1983. Consider the non-retaliation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the
    downing of the Korean Flight 007, and the <i>Sunday</i> massacre of
    the Marines in Beirut. (Note that day, again: Hitler&rsquo;s
    invasion of Poland, Hitler&rsquo;s invasion of Russia, the Japanese
    destruction of Pearl Harbor, the communist invasion of South Korea,
    the Beirut massacre &ndash; ALL occurred on a SUNDAY MORNING, local
    time!) Surely, these events all underscore <i>the supreme lesson of
      Pearl Harbor</i> &ndash; which Americans must <i>never</i> forget:
    the <i>unexpected</i> can and does happen! OFTEN! But, we digress.</p>
  <p class="western">While Tuscaloosa swung around the hook in Iceland
    &ndash; cooling it, you might say (I sure won&rsquo;t) &ndash;
    things really got hot in the U.S. The draft was immediately
    modified. Henceforth, going military would be an &ldquo;all-hands
    rate.&rdquo; There would be no more college deferments. All men
    between the ages of 18 and 45 (!) were called up for &ldquo;the
    duration (of the war) plus six months.&rdquo; By war&rsquo;s end,
    there would be fifteen million Americans in military uniform. And
    not only was the bugle sounding from coast to coast as we entered
    1942, the clanging of General Quarters, Submarine or Anti-Aircraft
    Defense became a too-familiar daily refrain throughout the Atlantic
    and Pacific. This was to be the year of the convoy and the Battle of
    the Atlantic. Some 1,664 ships were lost in 1942, 1,160 of them from
    submarines that infested the waters in which we plied our trade in
    Tuscaloosa. (The USS Jacob Jones was sunk in actual sight of the
    good folks at Cape May, New Jersey.) That one year, 1942, we lost no
    less than 8 million tons of allied shipping of all varieties.
    Clearly, the natural elements were no longer the only or even the
    major enemy of seafaring men. You said your prayers every night.</p>
  <p class="western">The reality of the war, though, still hadn&rsquo;t
    touched me personally in that January of 1942. I was still thinking
    of and expecting a future when I applied for postgraduate training
    in engineering that month. I was, of course, rejected, being much
    too junior. I frankly don&rsquo;t recall any nuance of ducking out
    of the war being involved. It was more a case of availing myself of
    any opportunity to enhance my civilian salability. And I was making
    professional progress. In early April, I became the Senior Assistant
    Engineer Officer, even as I only made Lt.(jg) on the 15th of April!</p>
  <p class="western">Already the need to siphon off both junior and
    senior lieutenants to man new-construction vessels was being felt
    among forces afloat and was accelerating promotions. As Morison
    remarks, &ldquo;The first four months of 1942 were the grimmest
    period of the war for the Allies, everywhere.&rdquo; But as with the
    Great Depression, you couldn&rsquo;t tell it by me. Thus, I was able
    in February to hitch a hop in one of our own SOCs (&ldquo;Same Old
    Curtiss&rdquo; pontooned biplanes) from a Norfolk overhaul to
    Annapolis. My pilot was shipmate Lt. &ldquo;Spinner&rdquo; McGee, on
    a routine training flight, in which he and Lt. Mike Massad spent the
    entire trip side-slipping close and below each other to reverse
    positions in a very tight formation en route to Annapolis. There I
    caught a Greyhound bus for a short, quick leave at home and with
    Kathleen. The war would go on, but it would have to wait for me.</p>

	&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Garnett</span></p>
  <p class="western">Manila had fallen on 2 Jan 1942, and by 11 March,
    MacArthur had departed RPI by motor torpedo boat for Australia, not
    to execute his &ldquo;I shall return&rdquo; until 20 Oct 1944 &ndash;
    a tough 2-1/2 years later! Following a Navy Yard overhaul, we joined
    a Task Force under RAdm. J. W. Wilcox and proceeded to barrage
    balloon&ndash;umbrella-ed Scapa Flow, arriving 4 April. We there
    came under the operational control of the Commander-in-Chief,
    British Home Fleet, and a British liaison unit forthwith joined our
    ship&rsquo;s company. One bizarre feature of this adventure was that
    a man-overboard muster turned up the fact that it was Adm. Wilcox
    himself who was lost at sea during heavy weather. (The Task Force
    didn&rsquo;t so much as pause in its journey.) He was thereupon
    succeeded by our own Adm. Giffen. From April to September 1942,
    Tuscaloosa, as an element of the Home Fleet, participated in several
    convoy-screening operations along the northern route to Russia, then
    under heavy German air, submarine, and surface pressure.</p>
  <p class="western">Halfway across the world, on 18 Apr 1942 (a mere
    132 days after the infamous and devastating Japanese strike on Pearl
    Harbor!), Doolittle&rsquo;s daring raid on Tokyo occurred. His 16
    B-25s, each carrying one 500# bomb, took off from &ldquo;Shangri-La&rdquo;
    (in Roosevelt&rsquo;s great phrase, which confounded the Japanese as
    to their source until after the war). Actually, they lifted off the
    U.S. carrier Hornet &ndash; some 688 miles off the coast of Japan &ndash;
    overflew Tokyo, and then proceeded another 1100 miles to friendly
    Chinese airfields. The surprise of the Japanese matched that of the
    Americans at Pearl Harbor, and not one B-25 was lost over Japan,
    although two pilots who splashed off the coast were caught and
    executed &ndash; an ugly practice in the Pacific theater which
    augured for the hanging of responsible officials following the war.</p>
  <p class="western">And, as if this imaginative venture did not in
    itself presage the ascendancy of aircraft-augmented vessels over
    mere surface craft, the battle of Coral Sea followed on 7&ndash;8
    May 1942. This was the battle that effectively saved Australia (and
    MacArthur) from the advancing Japanese hordes, and marked the first
    naval conflict in which the opposing seagoing forces in fact never
    actually sighted each other. Clearly, the air age had arrived. Yet,
    as recently as December 1983, and despite the success of the Exocet
    missile in the 1982 Falkland Islands fracas (not to mention Japanese
    kamikazes of WWII as an attractive option for fanatic Middle East
    terrorists), the U.S. battleship New Jersey patrolled the coast of
    Lebanon. Apparently the lessons of military experience are most
    difficult to learn.</p>
  <p class="western">Next came the pivotal battle of Midway on 3&ndash;6
    June 1942. It should be noted in passing that Japan was goaded in
    part to this critical over-extension by the Doolittle raid. It
    should further be noted that the American success is attributable in
    part to critical foreknowledge accruing from fortuitous
    code-breaking by American intelligence personnel. Nevertheless, a
    major share of credit for this crucial American victory must still
    go to the planning of Admiral Nimitz, and calm, competent execution
    by Admiral Spruance (who had just replaced the hospitalized Admiral
    Halsey &ndash; whose choleric temperament might well have engendered
    a less fortunate outcome).</p>
  <p class="western">In the brief span of a mere six minutes, the tide
    of the Pacific war turned once and for all in favor of American
    forces, which thenceforth assumed the offensive. What a prophetic
    name for this famous turning point &ndash; Midway. This aerial
    victory wiped out the entire fast Japanese four-carrier task group,
    some 250 planes and most of their pilots, and about 2200 officers
    and men. The 2403 Americans lost at Pearl Harbor had been avenged.
    The price was some 60 American pilots, who might well be compared to
    the flying heroes of the Battle of Britain, and equally worthy of
    the paean: &ldquo;Never have so many owed so much to so few.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">And even as those courageous airmen turned the
    tide in the Pacific, the tide had turned too on the American home
    front by that June of 1942. Already our industrial might was turning
    out destroyers in four months rather than the pre-war 12 months, and
    carriers were being completed in a mere 15 months rather than the
    earlier-required 35 months. But, you might well ask, &ldquo;What was
    I doing about this time, and how were things going in the Atlantic?&rdquo;
    The shortest (and perhaps the best) answer would be to reply: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    ask!&rdquo; Maybe you&rsquo;ve already heard of PQ-17, this being
    merely one of the murderous convoy runs to Murmansk (one of only two
    absolutely ice-free ports in northern Russia). Author Robert
    Sherwood has remarked that &ldquo;this was by all odds the most
    terrible of the whole war, subject as it was to attack not only by
    U-boats, but by surface raiders darting from Norwegian fjords and
    bombing planes from Norwegian air bases.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">He might well have added the danger of submersion
    in arctic waters, where potential survivors of sinking ships almost
    immediately lost all four limbs from instant frostbite (becoming,
    literally, basket cases) &ndash; if not actually freezing to death.
    Over a span of only two months in mid-1942, U-boats sank some 132
    ships &ndash; sometimes getting close enough to American shores to
    see the glow that arose from Broadway! Eventually, a &ldquo;brown-out&rdquo;
    of the coastal &ldquo;neon glow&rdquo; was effected from Atlantic
    City to Miami amid anguished cries from merchants that &ldquo;the
    tourist season will be ruined.&rdquo; Morison remarks that this
    success of the U-boats in 1942 &ldquo;was as much a national
    disaster as if saboteurs had destroyed half a dozen of our biggest
    war plants.&rdquo; We lost 400,000 tons from 7&ndash;14 July 1942 &ndash;
    &ldquo;a rate unexampled in this war or the last,&rdquo; according
    to Churchill. Clearly, this wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;pacific&rdquo;
    ocean.</p>
  <p class="western">This, then, was the background against which we
    sortied as a unit of PQ-17. In order to bait a trap for the Tirpitz,
    Anglo-American naval operations were mounted in an attempt to draw
    the German battleship out of her snowy Norwegian lair. Convoy PQ-17
    was one such attempt, and it ended in disaster, even though an
    operational star for the area ribbon was later awarded all
    participants. The 34 ships comprising the convoy departed Iceland on
    27 June and were spotted by German air reconnaissance on 1 July
    somewhat east and north of Jan Mayen Island. It was transporting
    157,000 tons of vitally needed Lend-Lease war materiel.</p>
  <p class="western">In the late afternoon of 2 July, the battleship
    Tirpitz and heavy cruiser Hipper left Trondheim with 4 destroyers
    and 2 torpedo boats, and the next night the pocket battleships Sheer
    and Lutzow plus 6 more destroyers departed Narvik. Fog-reduced
    visibility and a treacherous following current soon resulted in the
    grounding of Lutzow and 3 of the destroyers &ndash; an inauspicious
    beginning for any operation, though the German forces were willfully
    braving the known hazards of a route through the fjords to avoid
    detection by enemy aircraft. Meanwhile British air reconnaissance
    had revealed the empty berths at Trondheim on the afternoon of 3
    July, sounding the alarm for a possible attack on PQ-17 by heavy
    ships.</p>
  <p class="western">At this point, miscalculation took over. The
    Germans lost track of the British Home Fleet&rsquo;s heavy covering
    forces and refused to venture out of the fjords. However, this
    development was represented, until very recently, as being unknown
    to the Admiralty, which accordingly expected the heavy German ships
    to momentarily pounce on PQ-17, or worse yet, use that threat as a
    shield for springing its pocket battleships into the Atlantic, there
    to wreak havoc on less-well-protected merchantmen. Admittedly, the
    Admiralty was also reluctant to expose its combatant ships unduly to
    land-based Ju-88 dive-bombers unless assured of a chance to engage
    Tirpitz. In all events, the Admiralty chickened out at 2111 on 4
    July with the following order: &ldquo;Most immediate. Cruiser force
    withdraw to westward at high speed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">This sealed PQ-17&rsquo;s fate. Shortly
    thereafter, orders were issued to the convoy to disperse and proceed
    separately to Russian ports. Meanwhile the feared German ships
    languished in Alten Fjord (the northernmost port from which they
    might launch an attack on the convoy) like chained dogs, taking to
    sea only the next morning upon news of the allied withdrawal and
    dispersal actions. In short order they sent 23 of 34 ships to the
    bottom and littered the floor of the Barents Sea east of Bear Island
    with thousands of vehicles, tanks and aircraft that comprised their
    priceless cargo. Once more Mahan&rsquo;s dictum anent the strategic
    value of a fleet in being was roundly substantiated. So was
    bureaucratic bumbling, as we in Tuscaloosa were awarded a battle
    star on our European theatre emblem for our non-part in this sorry
    affair.</p>
  <p class="western">Tuscaloosa, like too many of the merchant ships
    she abandoned, never did make it to Russia with PQ-17, but she did
    survive to complete successfully a Russian run the following month,
    August 1942.<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote27anc" href="#sdendnote27sym"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
  <p class="western">There can be no doubt &ndash; these were
    frightening times in the Atlantic as well as in the Pacific. An
    exchange of letters with my parents during July 1942 is indicative
    of the tenor of the times as assessed by an on-site participant.
    Charles Lindbergh sums up my sentiments best in his observation to
    the effect that war underscores values of life and death like
    nothing else. &ldquo;The uncertainty caused an intensity of life, a
    deepened awareness. One truly had a greater appreciation of the
    moment because one sensed that each might be one&rsquo;s last.&rdquo;
    It was in this threatened frame of mind that I wrote &ldquo;Dear Mom
    and Pop&rdquo; on Saturday, 18 July 1942:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Every man likes to feel that he is
    individualistic &ndash; that he is different. At the same time,
    another common belief is that man, having a free will, does just as
    he pleases &ndash; and thus each man represents everything that he
    personally wants to be. Now there are no doubt many people who go
    through their entire lives believing just such things, but I hope
    I&rsquo;m not one of them &ndash; I&rsquo;ll certainly try not to
    be.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">There are no individuals in this world, and
    I can prove it. An individual is a person singularly independent of
    all other persons &ndash; a physical entity. Now, I&rsquo;ve never
    had a son, but I am myself a son, so I can grasp, even from this
    opposite scale position, some of the fundamental truths of life.
    Thus I perceive three aspects of life &ndash; physical, mental, and
    spiritual. It is a known fact that many, if not all, physical traits
    are hereditary &ndash; the color of the eyes, the hair, etc. To be
    sure, I am the very substance of my parents and, though I exist as
    an individual, it is only a paradox. Every time I become sick or
    injured, I know my parents suffer equally with me. And I know that
    they share my pains, for their absorbing sympathy has eased so many
    of them. So &ndash; I can&rsquo;t possibly consider myself a
    physical individual.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">My mental capacity is likewise a most
    unsingular thing. When I was a child, my mind was molded by you! You
    taught me infinitely more than the three R&rsquo;s. And even today,
    my formal schooling completed, I still learn something every day
    from you. It&rsquo;s a trite rule, but a true one &ndash; experience
    is the best teacher; and you have always shared your experience with
    me. To be sure, I&rsquo;m free to make my own decisions, but there
    are few of them that aren&rsquo;t considered in the light of the
    principles you have taught me. Public education is a luxury;
    domestic education is essential, and the influence of the latter is,
    in any case, the greater.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">We are especially not spiritual
    individuals, because at baptism the Holy Spirit inherited my soul as
    surely as He has an option on yours. God is everywhere, and He is
    One; and He is in us all! Of all the things I treasure, my religion
    is certainly foremost &ndash; and because of your faith it was
    virtually a matter of birthright.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The only conclusion I can draw from the
    propositions so far presented is that I&rsquo;m your son, and as
    such I owe you a debt of gratitude, respect, and love that is as yet
    a little beyond my means. I have so often heard people speak of
    their late parents &ldquo;They were swell! I wish I had done a
    little something to repay them.&rdquo; It struck me that after one&rsquo;s
    parents are gone, it is a little late to be expressing thanks, so I
    thought I&rsquo;d thank you now.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I must admit that I was at first confused.
    There is so little apparent means of showing gratitude. Anything of
    a material nature in the way of thanks would be insulting, so I
    couldn&rsquo;t just give you something and call it all &ldquo;square.&rdquo;
    I thought of praying for you, and though that is a means of thanking
    you, we know very well that my prayers for you will be equally
    effective, when some direct form of thanks no longer would be. After
    all, the souls in purgatory have millions of laborers, and those in
    heaven need none. Also, a mental picture of thanks in my mind
    certainly won&rsquo;t automatically indicate or reflect gratitude in
    yours. There is something I can do, though, and that is why I&rsquo;ve
    written this letter.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">First, I wish to thank you now for all the
    suffering, sacrificing, and all manner of enumerable hardships that
    you have undertaken in my behalf. I have told you that I am
    grateful; now I tell you I will attempt to prove it! I shall always
    attempt, with the grace of God, to live honestly and faithfully by
    the principles you have inculcated in me; and I promise always to
    try to conduct myself so that I shall forever be a credit to you,
    and to the God you introduced me to at birth.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Knowing this, I feel you cannot ever
    believe you have not lived successfully &ndash; whatever setbacks
    you yet have to face in this world. You have shown Margaret and Tom
    and myself the way, and now it is simply up to us. Thanks to your
    minute care, and your patience with drudging details, we have a
    correct map of life for which we all thank God every day of our
    lives.</p>
  <p class="western">My mother replied on Sunday, 23 August 1942.
    (Only the day before I was receiving my Blue Nose certificate for
    having crossed the Arctic Circle.) I offer only the initial portion
    responding directly to my earlier letter (as she then went on with
    six additional pages of purely family/neighborhood news). She wrote:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Received your nice letter of July 18th on
    August 18th &ndash; just a month old. And I want you to know Pop and
    I sure appreciate all those kind words of thanks you passed along so
    generously. It made us feel that our years of life together had not
    been spent in vain. There are many hardships in bringing up a family
    and there are times when there are so many problems involved it is
    hard to know which way to turn to solve them. I only know that I
    have prayed a lot for guidance to do the best at all times and
    sacrifice didn&rsquo;t mean a thing to me &ndash; especially in my
    younger days &ndash; my only thought being in trying to please God
    and in doing what I thought was my duty. I do not feel that you owe
    me a thing &ndash; all that I want is a little love and respect in
    return. Also, I must say I feel amply repaid by bringing up three
    good kids for the honor and glory of God. I think I have three
    exceptional children (not because they are mine) but from accounts
    from all who know them, and I think I have just cause to be proud of
    them and I am especially proud of their religious fervor in regard
    to duties. I only hope and trust the three of you will always remain
    as you are now and never stray from the path upon which I started
    you. Of course we all have our faults &ndash; no one of us is
    perfect, but we can strive to do better ourselves and lend a helping
    hand to others who are still struggling. There have been lots of
    times I have felt that I was a failure and have not done enough, but
    I must admit I did find lots of consolation in your letter and feel
    that maybe I have been of some use after all.</p>
  <p class="western">Pop replied five days later on Friday, 28 Aug
    1942, thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">It was a great pleasure for your mother and
    me to receive your letter of 18 July. It is in the nature of things
    that parents should spend themselves and their resources in trying
    to fit their children to fight the battle of life and their greatest
    reward is to find that their efforts have not been in vain.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">You would be wrong in saying that there are
    no individuals in this world. Everyone is different from everyone
    else. No two persons are precisely alike, even identical twins. But
    you are right in what I believe you meant by that phrase, namely,
    that man is a social animal and normally (that is, unless for high
    spiritual motives he lives the life of an eremite) requires the aid
    and association with other men.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">You are right in saying there are three
    sides to life (physical, mental and spiritual), but you would be
    wrong if you were to assert that the individual plays no part in the
    development of those three sides. It is true that from your parents&rsquo;
    physical bodies, through the mystery of the creative act of God, you
    receive in your body certain aptitudes or potentialities for
    physical perfections or defects, but the realization of these
    potentialities depends on a number of factors exclusive to the
    individual, such as food, environment, exercise and the like;
    otherwise the children of the same parents, being treated alike and
    from a common origin, would develop the same (which they do not).
    Blind parents would have blind children; perfect physical specimens
    would have perfect physical offspring. What you mean is probably
    that children, because they spring from the flesh and blood of their
    parents, have a special social tie, and empathy that identifies to a
    certain extent their mutual sufferings.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">With regard to the mental element, of
    course the cast of a child&rsquo;s thinking is molded in large
    measure by the influence of home. But here again this is not the
    entire picture. At school and at play and in all the social contacts
    outside the home, there are influences which at times support and at
    times frustrate the influence of the home. Perhaps you would say
    that the experience outside the home is but the application of
    principles learned inside the home. This is quite true to a certain
    extent, but here again you hit the nail on the head without
    apparently realizing its full import, when you said that you are
    free to make your own decisions. Herein is the importance of the
    individual himself. Otherwise there would be no bad children of good
    parents. Of course, as you say, the influence of the home is
    greater, especially in the early formative years, and more lasting,
    especially where the lessons of home have been well learned.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">With regard to the spiritual element, you
    are right in saying that at baptism the Holy Spirit inherited your
    soul and that because your parents happened to be Catholics it was
    virtually a matter of birthright. But the retention of that
    birthright after you reach maturity rests entirely upon you.
    Otherwise how do you account for defections and apostasies of
    children of Catholic parents?</p>
  <p class="quote-western">So while we appreciate your feeling a debt
    of gratitude, respect and love, this is merely for giving you the
    start in the right direction to the best of our ability. We owe you
    reciprocally gratitude and love because you have grasped the torch
    which we handed you and are carrying it forward in the right
    direction. While we are naturally delighted to have you express such
    feeling toward us now, you may rest assured that our greatest
    delight will come from your always conducting yourself to all men as
    befits your knowledge of the purpose of creation. I remember once
    talking to Mr. Barnum, who had done innumerable favors for me, and I
    asked him how could I ever repay him for all he had done. He replied
    that the best way I could show my appreciation to him was to pass
    the spirit of his favors on to others. I have never forgotten what
    he said. It made an indelible impression on me. So I pass this same
    thought on to you. In this connection, I hope you will read The
    Catholic Pattern by Thomas F. Woodlock, the book which Kathleen has
    sent you. The first half sums up in a hundred pages in a very able
    fashion your philosophy of life and mine. The second half
    demonstrates how this pattern offers an explanation for the mess we
    are in in the world and what is necessary to correct it. In the
    latter the individual plays but an infinitesimal part, but remember
    how the Lilliputians were able to tie down the huge Gulliver and you
    will not feel hopeless in doing what you can and in inducing others
    to participate. And in your relations with others, I do not mean
    that you should be superior and condescending or argumentative just
    for the sake of argument, much less bigoted, like some Catholics we
    know who are more Catholic than the Pope and display such
    intolerance as would put one to shame, but act in the realization
    that to be Catholic one must be catholic, intolerant of error but
    tolerant of those in error who through some chance have not had the
    good fortune and blessing of the faith. My own reading of Woodlock&rsquo;s
    book has induced me to start reading Father Walter Farrell&rsquo;s
    Companion to the Summa. It will be in four volumes, three of which
    have already appeared. I am reading the first volume now, about
    fifteen pages every night. If you like Woodlock and would like to
    read Farrell, let me know and Kathleen and I between us will see
    that they reach you.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Of course all this is like carrying coals
    to Newcastle, especially after reading your letter, but I wanted you
    to know how pleased we were to receive it. Your mother prays for you
    (as well as Margaret and Tom) constantly. In my Mass petitions is
    one special one for the three of you that you may select a life work
    and a life mate consistent with the maximum happiness in this world
    and salvation in the next. You do not hear often from me, but you
    must know that I read all the letters your mother writes and
    frequently suggest items for her to include. May God bless you and
    watch over you and keep you to do what is in His holy plan! May all
    good things be yours!</p>
  <p class="western">I confess a great serenity descended upon and
    enveloped me after this exchange of letters. I experienced the peace
    that comes with the feeling of having &ldquo;closed the gap&rdquo;
    or having &ldquo;completed the circuit.&rdquo; I felt totally
    comfortable knowing that my folks forever after would know precisely
    how I felt about them, come what may. And things weren&rsquo;t long
    in &ldquo;coming.&rdquo; Even as the foregoing letters were winging
    back and forth, U.S. Marines struck Guadalcanal on 7 August &ndash;
    an event which, I&rsquo;m sure, sent many Americans to the book
    stores in search of an atlas. Where was Guadalcanal, for chrissakes?
    On 12 August we lost the three sister ships of the Tuscaloosa at the
    battle of Savo Island, which I have alluded to earlier. Meanwhile
    Tuscaloosa herself was off again to Russia through sub-infested
    waters about 15 Aug 1942.</p>
  <p class="western">The first day out, and after almost immediate
    sighting by a German long-range aircraft, we were fortunately forced
    to turn back due to the outbreak of a case with the symptoms of
    spinal meningitis. The entire crew was canvassed for symptoms, the
    sick man was put ashore, and we were soon once again departing
    Seidisfjord, Iceland, for the Kola Gulf on 19 Aug 1942. We were
    transporting aerial torpedoes, ammunition, medical equipment, and
    large supplies of other critical stores and Allied personnel.
    Tuscaloosa was screened by destroyers Rodman and Emmons, with this
    small American contingent augmented by HMS Onslaught. This time we
    were favored by terrible visibility and thus remained undetected by
    German air patrols.</p>
  <p class="western">In the evening of the 22nd we rendezvoused with
    HMS Marne and HMS Martin, which thereupon joined the task group. On
    the afternoon of the 23rd, a Russian destroyer met and escorted the
    group into Kola Inlet, where Tuscaloosa secured alongside a dock at
    2000. (We thus became one of the very few U.S. ships to merit a
    Pacific-area campaign ribbon by having entered the area by heading
    east! There, and within 25 miles of a German air base, all deck
    hands turned to furiously unloading stores. The black gang was just
    as eagerly engaged in refueling. Some interesting sidelights were
    the sailors passing off brightly packaged soap as candy bars in
    exchange for souvenir rubles, and Russian officers directing their
    refueling crews with drawn pistols. Just prior to departure,
    Tuscaloosa embarked 243 passengers, most of whom were survivors of
    ships attached to previous north Russian convoys which hadn&rsquo;t
    fared so well. The passenger manifest even included a number who had
    endured the peculiar tribulations and special agony of PQ-17. There
    were 35 &ldquo;basket cases,&rdquo; which were berthed in the
    airplane hangar. I sadly confess I couldn&rsquo;t even bring myself
    to pass through the hangar en route back to Iceland lest I have to
    confront these pitiful youngsters. We departed Kola Gulf on 24 Aug
    after an all-night, around-the-clock workout.</p>
  <p class="western">In the afternoon of the 25th, acting on Admiralty
    advice received while still east of Bear Island, HMS Onslaught,
    Marne, and Martin were detached from the group to make a sweep of
    that island, while the main body of the group continued on to the
    northward. The British destroyers discovered a German submarine
    supply vessel, ULM, and after a brief engagement sank it by gunfire,
    recovering numerous prisoners. As a result of radio reports by the
    ULM and sighting by German reconnaissance aircraft, a formation of
    enemy planes appeared in search of Allied ships. Due to the
    prevailing low visibility, both groups of ships happily eluded them.
    Tuscaloosa was sighted and shadowed by enemy long-range seaplanes
    through the morning and during part of the afternoon of the 26th,
    but only the first plane&rsquo;s probable relief appeared. The
    latter was lost to sight shortly after Emmons fired on it, placing
    bursts very close. HMS Onslaught, Marne, and Martin rejoined later
    that afternoon and the entire task group arrived at Seidisfjord on
    the 28th without further incident.</p>
  <p class="western">After a brief stop at the mouth of the River
    Clyde to disembark our British contingent, we were detached from the
    Home Fleet, at last, and proceeded via Hvalfjordur, Iceland, to a
    routine overhaul at Boston Naval Shipyard, thus completing our
    arduous Atlantic patrols.</p>
  <p class="western">We were still at war, of course, and were even in
    process of negotiating the perilous north Atlantic, but my heart and
    mind were now almost exclusively with Kathleen back in D.C. In this
    interim I had become eligible according to naval regulations to get
    married. I well remember coming off watch (out of the depths of the
    torrid engineering spaces) in the dark of night and proceeding
    topside for a brief moment of cooling refreshment. I&rsquo;d look up
    at the golden moon and reflect how somewhere over the horizon at
    that very moment Kathleen could be beholding the same scene, and so
    the moon was indeed a proper symbol for linking lovers. (Later, in
    the so-called Pacific, I&rsquo;d behold the same moon linking me to
    my stateside family, and then consider how beyond the horizon to the
    west even then danger was lurking in the form of Japanese fanatics
    who sought nothing else than our utter destruction. Yet the moon
    sped on through peaceful cloud-etched skies. But, enough dreaming.)</p>
  <p class="western">En route to Boston my boss, the Chief Engineer,
    Cdr. Slavin, got ashore briefly at Argentia. It was long enough for
    him to arrange air passage for me via the Air Force to Boston, there
    to entrain for Washington. I also had him send a telegram to my
    father, asking that he contact Kathleen and ask her to set a fast
    marriage in motion.</p>
  <p class="western">To say that my sending this caveat via my father
    rather than directly to Kathleen didn&rsquo;t precipitate at least a
    mild fit of pique would be somewhat inaccurate. She was put out, but
    only momentarily. Naturally, I had my reasons. To begin with,
    although our engagement had at long last been published in the Post
    on 8 May 1942, I had never spoken of marriage to her folks.
    Furthermore, I still (rightly or wrongly) regarded her mother as
    formidably proper if not somewhat hostile. As to her father, I
    regarded him as so absorbed in church work as to seemingly be more
    or less oblivious to me and (certainly relative to Mrs. Kirk)
    unaware of the doings within his own family. Hence I assumed all
    decision in the matter would reside in Mrs. Kirk, and I didn&rsquo;t
    want Kathleen to have to take on any potential pleas for delay
    alone.</p>
  <p class="western">Further, I felt my father was perhaps the most
    persuasive adult I knew and, in the event of any difficulties with
    my proposition <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Mr. or Mrs. Kirk, or
    necessity for circumventing civil or ecclesiastical red tape, I
    wanted him on hand from the outset. Keep in mind that the Kirks not
    only (and correctly, of course) regarded marriage as a most critical
    life event, there was the consideration of the added complexities
    attending wartime marriages. Remember, too, I had been away a rather
    long time, and exposed to danger. So, sorry, Kathleen, I still think
    I proceeded in the most intelligent manner possible under the
    circumstances.</p>
  <p class="western">In any event, I arrived in Washington on a
    Thursday evening, barely more than 24 working hours before the
    marriage set for 10 AM, Monday, 14 Sep 1942. Once over her initial
    fit of pique, Kathleen confesses,</p>
  <p class="western">From then on I was just sort of floating &ndash;
    overwhelmed with delight that we were getting married at last. It
    seemed that everyone else (my parents and yours) made all the
    decisions, but I didn&rsquo;t care &ndash; went along with all their
    ideas and suggestions. First, your Pop went with me to get the
    license and blood test &ndash; I don&rsquo;t remember what you did
    about a blood test [nor do I!]. Then mother and I went to Garfinkels
    &ndash; the only time I have ever shopped like a rich person. We
    explained the situation and they took us to a very fancy fitting
    room and brought everything to us &ndash; suits, dresses, underwear,
    blouses, even shoes and luggage. The only thing we had to leave the
    room for was to order the announcements.</p>

    Last picture as a <i>single</i> man</h3>
  <p class="western">Of course, the very first thing I did was call
    work [the Federal Public Housing Authority where she labored as a
    CAF-7, Junior Fiscal Accountant, for $2000 per year] and tell them
    to put me on indefinite leave. Then there was the procedure
    (dispensation from the waiting period) which had to be arranged at
    church. At this time St. Anthony&rsquo;s church was in the process
    of renovation and was full of scaffolding, so we (someone, probably
    your Pop) arranged for us to be married at St. Martin&rsquo;s.
    Because of the time element all guests had to be invited by phone,
    but I have no idea who did all this. I was amazed that so many
    people did come on such short notice, and on a workday Monday
    morning at that! Also Mother arranged for the reception at the
    then-very-chic Wardman Park Hotel just off Connecticut Avenue. I
    vaguely remember going there with her, likewise arranging for a
    limousine and a photographer.</p>

    It&rsquo;s all over now! 14 Sep 1942</h3>
  <p class="western">Now that I think of it, all this must have been
    quite an expense for my folks, but at the time I never gave it a
    thought. (We started our 40th wedding anniversary party, you may
    remember, by belatedly thanking my father for our &ldquo;first&rdquo;
    reception.) Our nuptial mass was celebrated by Fr. James P. Grace,
    then assistant pastor of St. Anthony&rsquo;s and later pastor, until
    his death, at St. Camillus in White Oak. The choir of St. Paul&rsquo;s
    College provided the music &ndash; Gregorian Chant, from the proper
    for the Blessed Virgin Mary. The papers reported that I wore a suit
    of blue chiffon velvet (which several of our daughters have since
    worn) with dubonnet accessories and a corsage of white orchids.
    [Your author, of course, wore the uniform of a Lieutenant, j.g.,
    U.S. Navy.] My sister, Lucille, was maid of honor and Uncle Tom was
    best man. My cousin, Kirk Krutsch [whom we now visit in Largo,
    Florida], Uncle Jimmy, and a mutual high school classmate, Tom
    Walsh, were the ushers. Newspaper accounts report that I&rsquo;d be
    living temporarily with my parents after my husband rejoined his
    ship on 9 October 1942.</p>

    Flanked by Kirk Krutsch and Tom Walsh</h3>
  <p class="western">So we were married at last &ndash; on a
    beautifully bright and warm early fall day, much like the one Pat
    and George got married on in Boston many years later. I personally
    have only one recollection of the hectic period between my arrival
    in town on Thursday evening and the wedding on Monday morning. I
    still recall my frustration and impatience over my father insisting
    that I interrupt my shaving the night before the wedding to listen
    to some radio comedy show he was enjoying. Naturally my mind was
    otherwise preoccupied, and I finally begged off &ndash; to his
    evident hurt. He had only wanted to share enjoyment. As to the
    wedding itself, I have not one single memory. I first &ldquo;came
    to&rdquo; in a private parlor in the Wardman Park Hotel, which had
    been reserved for Kathleen and my private sausage and biscuit
    breakfast (between the wedding and the reception). It was our first
    moment alone as husband and wife, and our act would have earned
    something between a PG and R rating. As to the reception, I couldn&rsquo;t
    have cared less. All I wanted to do was catch our plane and be off
    to our brief New York honeymoon. I kept insisting from the start
    that we had stayed long enough, and in fact we finally did leave,
    I&rsquo;m sure, much too early.</p>

    Leaving Wardman Park reception for NYC honeymoon</h3>
  <p class="western">Our trip to New York was in a DC-3, out of Hoover
    Airfield (Washington National didn&rsquo;t exist then) at the
    western end of the old 14th Street bridge. The only event worth
    mentioning was our mutual delight at the hostess being the first
    person to address Kathleen as &ldquo;Mrs. Wright.&rdquo; Our
    reception in New York was at best a mini-disaster. I&rsquo;d
    neglected to make any reservation, and rooms were mighty hard to
    come by during the war. We ended up with a bathroomless broom closet
    in the Hotel Taft. Luckily, my buddy, John McCarthy, who missed the
    wedding in virtue of the Army&rsquo;s prior claim on his services
    elsewhere, sent a congratulatory telegram to us at the Taft. Thus,
    the next morning, the hotel management was almost apoplectic with
    apology, and forthwith they moved us to a suite (large bedroom,
    sitting room and kitchenette) at the nearby and substantially more
    ritzy Hotel Warwick &ndash; for FREE. We immediately stocked meals
    from the world-famous 8th Avenue Delis. Believe me, soldiers and
    sailors &ndash; especially those on fleeting honeymoon respites &ndash;
    really knew the meaning of RHIP (rank has its privileges) in wartime
    NYC! Thus, too, when we went to dinner at the Hotel New Yorker the
    next night to dance to Johnny Long (of <i>Shanty in Old Shantytown</i>
    fame) and watch the Ice Capades, we were ushered around a long line
    to a ringside seat, and (because, as I remember, Kathleen was still
    sporting her corsage) got a newlywed salute from the band.</p>
  <p class="western">Another night we covered the jazz spots on 52nd
    Street. There, within 50 steps of each other were John Kirby at the
    Onyx Club, Woody Herman at the Hickory House, and Count Basie (still
    featuring Lester Young) at The Famous Door. Immediately across the
    street were Jimmy McPartland at Jimmy Ryan&rsquo;s Bar and the King
    Cole Trio plus Billie Holiday at Kelly&rsquo;s Stable. Still another
    night, we joined several couples of shipmates at the Cafe Society
    Uptown to check out Hazel Scott at the organ and the Golden Gate
    Quartet (then featuring <i>Stalin Wasn&rsquo;t Stalling</i>). Bing
    Crosby (without toupee) was in a group at the next table. We got so
    wild they almost threw us out. We took the bunch back to our Warwick
    Hotel &ldquo;drawing room&rdquo; for a snack and nightcap. They were
    amazed that we could afford such luxury. (We never told them how.)</p>
  <p class="western">Still another night, Kathleen and I literally
    &ldquo;took the A-train&rdquo; to 125th street and then strolled
    after dark through Harlem to the Cotton Club, where we shared a
    table with another couple (black). We watched Cab Calloway and a
    featured ex-gospel singer, Sister Rosetta Tharp, whose wailing of a
    song called <i>And It Made Him Mad<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote28anc" href="#sdendnote28sym"><sup>28</sup></a></i>
    entranced me so much that I tried unsuccessfully for years afterward
    to find a recording.</p>
  <p class="western">We even stopped by the Savoy Ballroom where Chick
    Webb alternated with Al Cooper&rsquo;s &ldquo;Savoy Sultans.&rdquo;
    Finally we took in the zany Olsen and Johnson madhouse stage show
    <i>Hellzapoppin!</i> (They had stunts where audience participants
    received live chickens and 10-pound blocks of naked ice as awards,
    and doused the lights and dropped &ldquo;snakes&rdquo; from the
    ceiling. Also, when a baby started crying in the rear, Olsen begged
    someone to rock it to sleep, even as Johnson wound up and heaved
    something toward a cringing audience while announcing, &ldquo;And
    here&rsquo;s a rock!&rdquo; Quite some show.) Quite some honeymoon!</p>
  <p class="western">Then it was back to the war. On 1 Oct 1942 I made
    full Lieutenant. On 23 Oct 1942 we sortied from Norfolk, thence to
    rendezvous off Bermuda. The next morning we awoke to the most
    stirring sight I was ever to witness &ndash; we were stark in the
    middle of 800 horizon-to-horizon ships! Awesome! (Some 1400 ships
    would later assault Sicily, and 5000 were employed on D-Day.) We
    were a unit of Operation Torch &ndash; the Allied landing in Africa.
    Some 107 &ldquo;sail&rdquo; comprised our force, which ultimately
    split off for the northwestern coast of Africa from Mehedia to Safi.
    This, in what then was French Morocco, constituted the first
    ship-to-shore continent-to-continent landing in history, and came,
    it should be noted, exactly eleven months after the disaster at
    Pearl Harbor. The Western segment of Torch (which comprised wholly
    U.S. forces) involved northern, central and southern units, and
    included some 25,000 troops under Major General George Patton.
    (Eisenhower was Commander-in-Chief of Allied forces.) Tuscaloosa was
    an element of the central force under Admiral Ike Giffen, which
    included the battleship Massachusetts and heavy cruiser Wichita.</p>
  <p class="western">At 0700 on 8 Nov 1942 (on the so typical American
    code phrase of &ldquo;Play Ball!&rdquo;) we opened up on the four
    8-inch coast defense guns of El Hank Battery near the Casablanca
    lighthouse, which were augmented by the 15-inch gun of the French
    battleship Jean Bart, immobilized in the harbor. Morison reports
    that the American gunfire was faster, heavier, and more accurate.
    You couldn&rsquo;t prove it by me. I was again battened-up below
    decks, but this time I was at least above the waterline. To improve
    the probability of a qualified survivor, the Chief Engineer kept
    station at main engine control in the forward engine room. The Asst.
    Chief Engineer (me) accordingly kept station at Engineering Repair
    (which was Repair 5 in Tuscaloosa) with my specific location being
    in the Oil King&rsquo;s shack amidships on the outboard starboard
    side of the second deck &ndash; which put me above both the
    waterline and the armored deck. There I sat out the battle with
    Chief Watertender Red Hanrahan, and the main propulsion maneuvering
    phone circuit talker.</p>
  <p class="western">Hanrahan was an extremely savvy Oil King. In
    battle, his main function was to assure a continuous supply of good
    (undiluted by sea water) fuel out to the steaming boilers, all eight
    of which were on line at GQ. Otherwise his function was to maintain
    fuel and fresh feed water inventory, assure full tanks were always
    on suction to steaming boilers, and transfer oil and flood empty
    tanks with salt water to maintain an even keel and preclude any
    quick or drastic list should an unballasted tank suddenly be opened
    to the sea by a gun-hit, mine or torpedo. He was also the most
    involved and responsible person in fueling ship, in harbor or at
    sea. It&rsquo;s safe to say that the Oil King was customarily the
    smartest enlisted rating in the black gang<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote29anc" href="#sdendnote29sym"><sup>29</sup></a>.
    Hanrahan was certainly no exception.</p>
  <p class="western">I can still remember our exchange of white-faced
    stares when our topside smoke watch exclaimed over the 1JV phone
    (maneuvering circuit), &ldquo;Jesus! A 15-inch shell from Jean Bart
    just pierced the colors just forward of #1 stack!&rdquo; Also,
    Tuscaloosa &ldquo;was forced to maneuver to avoid a torpedo fired by
    a French submarine near the beach, which swept down the port side
    not over fifteen feet away.&rdquo; So reads the bland official
    history of Tuscaloosa. I can assure you &ndash; it&rsquo;s something
    else to actually hear the warning cry, &ldquo;Torpedoes approaching,
    port side!&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re buttoned up below decks. I can
    remember sinking to the floor on my rump and hoisting my legs from
    the deck by grasping my knees. Battle reports were replete with data
    on broken ankles of those caught standing when torpedoes struck.
    Still Wichita took the only hit, from El Hank, which wounded 14 men.</p>

    Newspaper article about the naval battle off Casablanca, November 8,
    1942<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote30anc" href="#sdendnote30sym"><sup>30</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">Eventually we sank most of the French fleet while
    planes from Ranger (&ldquo;Teaspoon&rdquo;) rocked enemy tanks
    ashore. We broke off the action at 1145. Patton&rsquo;s troops
    encountered little resistance ashore, and a ceasefire was issued
    from Marshal Petain at Vichy on 11 November. Herman Wouk says of
    this fray: &ldquo;&hellip; Perhaps never before had oceans borne
    such a force: aircraft, battleships, cruisers, troop transports, and
    newfangled landing craft crammed full of small craft, tanks, trucks,
    and mobile guns; also destroyers, minecraft, submarines, and
    assorted supply vessels; from several directions, in far-flung
    formations, these warships of frowning shapes and many sizes,
    painted gray or in gaudy camouflage colors, were crawling the watery
    curve of the planet&hellip; It was the largest, most difficult, most
    successful long-distance sea-borne invasion in history.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Well, at least I was there. But, by 26 November,
    Kathleen and I were once again ensconced together, this time in a
    room at the Bellevue-Stratford atop Boston&rsquo;s Beacon Hill. We
    celebrated the evening of 27 November in the lower-floor Melody
    Lounge of the Coconut Grove night club, which featured jazzy black
    singer-pianist Rose &ldquo;Chi-Chi&rdquo; Murphy. I raved about her
    all the next day to my two shipboard roommates, Marine Lt. Walt
    Goodpasture (married to Mary Daly two days) and reserve Ensign
    Barney Ireland. All three perished the next night, 28 Nov 1942, in
    the historic Coconut Grove fire, which claimed 491 lives! We were
    alerted to the tragedy when our ship conducted a phoned bed-check to
    the Bellevue-Stratford around midnight.</p>
  <p class="western">Think of it. Casablanca 0: Coconut Grove 3! The
    tragedy occurred on the Saturday night of the day on which Holy
    Cross upset Boston College 55-12. The Boston College team
    accordingly canceled its reservation for a victory dinner
    celebration at the Coconut Grove. Talk about providential
    intervention! The fire started at 1008, and the first fire engines
    arrived (from another nearby fire scene) by 1012. Nevertheless, by
    1020, in the span of a devastating 12-minute holocaust, 491 lives
    were snuffed out and an additional 200 were injured. Among the
    latter was cowboy movie star Buck Jones, in town for a war bond
    rally, who died 2 days later.</p>
  <p class="western">The first victims arrived at the nearest hospital
    by 1035. There another providential intervention was reflected in
    the availability of the full staff &ndash; thanks to all hands being
    present for a Thanksgiving party. Most deaths occurred due to
    inhalation of smoke and super-heated air. It was all over by 1110,
    when first re-entry was effected a mere one hour and 10 minutes
    later. The main reason for the incredible carnage was that the ONLY
    free exit was a revolving door, which was rendered inoperative by
    panic-driven celebrators simultaneously charging both sides of the
    door. Bodies were piled three and four deep there, and on the single
    narrow stairway leading up from the Melody Lounge where we had been
    the night before. Post-fire inspection revealed all other exits to
    be double-locked, and one was even welded shut.</p>
  <p class="western">The next day, it was almost impossible to find a
    public place to eat. Every restaurant and club had been shut down by
    a citywide ordinance to enable checking of compliance with safety
    regulations. In fact, new regulations were immediately introduced.
    Henceforth there had to be emergency power supply to exit signs, all
    exit doors had to open outward and revolving doors had to be fitted
    with collapsible hinges in the opposite direction, all decorations
    had to be fire-proofed, etc. So, once again the barn was locked
    after the escape of the horse. Still, you can bet that anybody who
    was associated as closely with the Coconut Grove disaster as we were
    still checks the exits immediately upon settling in any public area
    even to this day!</p>
  <p class="western">Again, life and the war went on. On 2 Dec 1942,
    the first successful atomic chain reaction was accomplished at
    Chicago. On 2 Feb 1943, the Germans were finally stopped short at
    Stalingrad, marking the turn of the tide of the war in Europe. By 9
    Feb 1943, the uphill struggle begun on Guadalcanal on 7 Aug 1942 was
    completed as the island was swept clean of Japanese, thereby
    signaling that the allies were in the far Pacific to stay.
    Meanwhile, I was still looking ahead. On 12 Feb 1943, I submitted my
    second request for postgraduate training. This application was
    buttressed considerably by the personal action of my then Commanding
    Officer, Captain Norman C. Gillette. First of all, Captain Gillette
    endorsed my request for PG school as follows:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">1. Forwarded, <i>strongly</i> recommending
    approval.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">2. Lt. Wright&rsquo;s reports of fitness
    amply prove him qualified for postgraduate instruction. His low
    class standing (traditionally you had to be in the top 25% of your
    class, and I was in the bottom 3.7%) is considered no criterion of
    his intelligence, application, and ability.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Lt. Wright is an <i>outstanding</i>
    officer. Although only having 2 and 1/2 years of commissioned
    service, the entire time has been in the Engineering Department of
    this vessel where he has performed his duties in an <i>outstanding</i>
    manner and for the past 10 months has most ably filled the billet of
    Assistant Engineer Officer, an assignment which would normally be
    filled by a much more senior officer. <i>I would be especially
      desirous of having him serve under me in wartime.</i></p>
  <p class="western">In addition to this, Captain Gillette appended a
    handwritten postscript to my typed fitness report covering the
    period 1 Jan to 20 Apr 1943. My immediate boss and the author of
    this fitness report, the Chief Engineer, stated merely, &ldquo;Took
    part in engagement with French Naval Forces and shore batteries at
    Casablanca, Morocco, on 8 November 1942. Conducted himself in
    accordance with best tradition of Naval Service.&rdquo; To this
    Captain Gillette hand-scrawled, &ldquo;Same for several Murmansk
    convoys. Excellent personal and military character. As Senior
    Assistant Engineer Officer he has performed his duties in an
    excellent manner which is especially noteworthy considering his age
    and experience. Recommended for promotion.&rdquo; These credentials
    apparently carried the day, for I was indeed selected for PG
    training, and thus landed 1-1/2 years shore duty with my new wife
    less than 40 miles from our parents&rsquo; homes at the very height
    of the war. How did I feel about such a chicken development? Simply
    great!</p>

  <p class="western">But I wasn&rsquo;t out of it yet. As Morison has
    said, &ldquo;The battle of the Atlantic came to a head in 1943. The
    Germans concentrated under Doenitz on producing more and better
    U-boats and new types which could submerge for long periods. The
    number operating in the Atlantic more than doubled, and their
    effectiveness was increased by sending supply subs &ndash; &lsquo;milch
    cows&rsquo; &ndash; enabling replenishment without returning to
    France. Few outside the two navies (British and American) and
    merchant marines realized how serious the situation had become in
    Mar 1943. The U-boats &hellip; sank 108 ships that month, totaling
    627,000 tons&hellip; So many U-boats were at sea (an average of 116
    operating daily in the North Atlantic) that evasive action was
    futile&hellip;&rdquo; The big question in mid-1943 was whether
    existing U-boat types could be mastered in time to enable America to
    get enough men and weapons across to beat Germany before the new
    U-boats got into production.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">All was saved by a dramatic reverse of fortune in
    the anti-submarine war in Apr and May. By Dec 1942 some 260 new DEs
    were in commission, and by Mar 1943 the first CVE<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote32anc" href="#sdendnote32sym"><sup>32</sup></a>
    (capable of operating 24 planes) was in service. Nor was that the
    whole story. A book review in the 19 Jun 1978 Newsweek pinpoints the
    <i>coup de grace</i> thus: &ldquo;Suddenly the U-boats became
    Germany&rsquo;s last hope of survival. What extinguished it is one
    of history&rsquo;s choice ironies: a staggering 85% of the Wehrmacht
    submarine fleet succumbed to the Allies&rsquo; new radar,
    reconnaissance and targeting mechanisms because the exodus of talent
    from Hitler&rsquo;s regime had brought German technological
    development to a standstill. To the submarine crews, these new
    Allied technologies were mystifying. &lsquo;It was as though the sea
    was suddenly of glass,&rsquo; writes German historian Michael
    Salewski.&rdquo; Tough rockos, Adolph!</p>

    Crew reaction &ndash; Made DC Sunday paper</h3>
  <p class="western">So the tide turned. Much of this time Tuscaloosa
    operated off the east coast on training exercises, at the same time
    serving as an element of a fast, mobile striking force ready for any
    eventuality &ndash; as, for example, a breakthrough by a German
    surface raider. In late May Tuscaloosa escorted RMS Queen Mary,
    which bore Prime Minister Churchill to a New York meeting with FDR.
    The only other contribution I made during this period (and one I
    continue to this day) was incident to the pay-as-you-go income taxes
    initiated by the withholding law of 10 Jun 1942.</p>

    1943. This was as it should be. Morison attests, &ldquo;There is no
    denying that the submarine was the greatest threat to Allied victory
    over the Axis.&rdquo; He then adds, &ldquo;The graph of Allied and
    neutral merchant ship losses was overtaken by that of new
    construction in Jul 1943, and the two never converged again.&rdquo;
    Clearly, my job in the Atlantic was completed. I now looked forward
    to a stint ashore (ostensibly to study engineering in depth,
    actually to start begetting a family in earnest). Even so, I also
    looked back fondly to Tuscaloosa and her splendid crew.</p>
  <p class="western">Tuscaloosa was to go on to pound the beaches at
    Normandy on D-Day, 6 Jun 1944; to bombard the Bitter Rock better
    known as Iwo Jima in Feb of 1945; and to splash two kamikazes at
    Okinawa on Palm Sunday, 25 Mar 1945. She rightfully claimed &ldquo;a
    charmed life&rdquo; throughout WWII, and on Thursday, 29 Nov 1945,
    she crossed the International Date Line, homeward bound as part of
    the &ldquo;Magic Carpet&rdquo; returning veterans to the States. She
    thus finally enjoyed two Thanksgivings (advanced a week in
    1939&ndash;40&ndash;41 by FDR to aid Christmas sales) in a row,
    thereby atoning at last for the miserable one we suffered on 20 Nov
    1941. She made yet another run to Noumea, New Caledonia, via
    Guadalcanal in the Solomons on 14 Dec, thereby crossing the equator
    and converting polliwogs to shellbacks, the one sea-going ritual in
    which I never got to participate. She entered the reserve fleet at
    Philadelphia on 13 Feb 1946, was struck from the Navy list on 1 Mar
    1959, and was sold for scrap to a Baltimore salvage company on 15
    Jun 1959. She remains my favorite ship.</p>

      XI. FAMILY</h2>
  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western">Raising children has throughout
    history been the most consistent way that people have found of
    bringing riches and meaning to life.<span style="font-style: normal">
	&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Fallows</span></p>
  <p class="western">As has now long since become evident, my life has
    always been a study in stark parallels with or contrast to the
    nature and tempo of prevailing world conditions. It should therefore
    not be too surprising that by the very height of the war years &ndash;
    the last half of 1943 and all of 1944 &ndash; my seafaring life went
    into a 1-1/2-year hiatus as I began postgraduate instruction in
    Machinery Design at West Annapolis, Maryland. There were only 24 in
    my class, with numerous representatives from the classes of 1939 and
    1941, and a few Reserves. I was the only fugitive from the class of
    1940. So, once again, I was totally out of phase with my classmates.
    The strangeness of my situation didn&rsquo;t stop there. Even as my
    peers were fighting and dying around the world, I was setting up the
    first shoreside home of my very own, striving furiously to get a
    family of my own underway.<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote34anc" href="#sdendnote34sym"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
  <p class="western">This is not to say that I neglected my school
    work. In fact, I studied very hard and long. Yet, I must confess I
    was now in deeper over my head at PG school than I had been at USNA.
    One of my PG classmates went on to be a top assistant to become
    Chairman of the Board of National Cash Register, NCR. This was fast
    company indeed. Figures were never forthcoming, but I can easily
    imagine that I stood 24 in the class of 24. My record shows one A
    (Outstanding, in Thermodynamics), twelve B&rsquo;s (Excellent), five
    C&rsquo;s (Very Good), and one D (Passing, in Mechanical
    Engineering). Now, I&rsquo;m not proud of that. It&rsquo;s just a
    fact, and I can assure you I did my best. Anyway, that doesn&rsquo;t
    tell the whole story. My entire professional career is living proof
    of an increasingly common belief that school grades are not
    necessarily any true indication of a person&rsquo;s intelligence or
    worth. The fitness report occasioned by my detachment from
    Tuscaloosa further testifies to a contrasting evaluation, thus:
    &ldquo;This officer has demonstrated administrative and planning
    ability well beyond that expected for his length of service. He has
    initiative and is energetic and industrious. His personal and
    military character are of the highest.&rdquo; To all that I can only
    add, &ldquo;Oh, hell yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">From this it could be easy for all my children to
    see why I&rsquo;ve always preached to them to always give their work
    efforts their very best shot. I know this is the road to success.
    Perhaps the main reason this is true is that such a large majority
    of people take so little pride in their work and so goof off and do
    everything in half-assed fashion. As Dr. Charles Malik, former
    President of the U.N. General Assembly, has said, &ldquo;That a man
    (or woman) should seek individual, personal, human excellence &hellip;
    is exceedingly rare.&rdquo; In such a milieu (which, I think, has
    become even more prevalent today than in my day) any genuine worker
    who pursues excellence is bound to stick out like a &ldquo;stripper&rdquo;
    in a Carmelite monastery.</p>
  <p class="western">In any event, PG school actually began for me on
    2 Aug 1943. Prior to that, Kathleen had managed to procure us both
    an automobile and a place to live. Now these two accomplishments
    represent a considerably more amazing achievement than might be
    appreciated. All new car production had long since ceased, along
    with the production of replacement parts and vital appurtenances
    such as tires. In a phrase, getting any kind of a car was a
    formidable project. Kathleen came up with a car model that had
    ceased production even before the shutdown occasioned by the war.
    Our first family auto was &ndash; are you ready for this &ndash; a
    Graham! (What do you mean, you never heard of them?) The neatest
    thing about this deal was that, precisely because they had been out
    of business for so long, they had plenty of replacement parts. All
    you had to do was to write to their warehouse in St. Louis.</p>
  <p class="western">This was the car, incidentally (and the time and
    the place), where Kathleen taught me to drive. I&rsquo;ll never
    forget my driver&rsquo;s test. The streets were a mixture of ice and
    snow, for starters. To make it even tougher, I had to parallel park
    (my very first such effort!) between 2 parking markers on a hill on
    a circle (Church Circle in Annapolis)! That ain&rsquo;t easy, folks,
    but I did it. The check rider OK&rsquo;d my slip and told me to take
    it back to DMV for my license. He then got out of the car to take on
    the next testee. I then proceeded to return to DMV &ndash; knocking
    over the parking marker as I left! I didn&rsquo;t stop to look back.</p>
  <p class="western">The house we got was something special, too. It
    had formerly been a summer cottage, comprising upstairs and
    downstairs apartments. It was therefore furnished with minimal
    summer-type wicker furniture and no insulation. I don&rsquo;t
    remember what (if anything beyond electric plug-ins) had been added
    for heating. I remember the fun we had converting an ancient bathtub
    into a combination shower by the judicious use of coat hangers, sail
    cloth, rubber tubing and a garden hose spray nozzle. There just
    wasn&rsquo;t any custom hardware available during the war. You
    couldn&rsquo;t buy any appliances, either. We salvaged a broken
    portable washing machine from somebody&rsquo;s junk heap, took down
    nameplate data to order spare parts from some Midwestern
    manufacturer, and actually got it to work. We installed it in our
    walk-in pantry, and it sure came in handy for doing diapers after
    George was born.</p>

    PG school home &ndash; 44, George&rsquo;s birthplace</h3>
  <p class="western">The place had two bedrooms, one of which became
    my study until George arrived and took over (and did he take over!)
    Water was supplied from a well via a not-so-automatic pump, which
    always seemed to fail during cold winter morning shaves.
    Fortunately, our downstairs neighbor (who had preceded us on the
    premises) assumed it was his prerogative to brave the outside
    elements to restore it to operating order. (His piercing &ldquo;God
    damn it!&rdquo; often first alerted me that we had a problem, and
    that still rings in my ears.) The grass was mowed by a grazing
    work-horse who was moved along by a black tenant farmer known to us
    only as Thomas.</p>
  <p class="western">What we lived on was an old, virtually unworked
    farm, complete with a private dock (on Weems Creek) and high diving
    board. Kathleen and I each went off it twice, so we could say,
    &ldquo;Sure! We&rsquo;ve done it more than once.&rdquo; Ours was one
    of four side-by-side summer cottages, and then there was the big
    white clapboard master&rsquo;s house. The area was called Solmson
    Heights, and was within a 10-minute walk to the PG school gate of
    the Naval Academy grounds. It was not only a perfect set up for us,
    it also served as the locale for our annual class picnics. Everyone
    gathered to dive, boat, and swim off of our dock, hold a softball
    game in our front yard, and then steam fresh-caught crabs in our
    kitchen. (At that time I didn&rsquo;t even eat crabs myself, but I
    was told over and over that they were succulent!)</p>
  <p class="western">Kathleen decorated and even furnished the place
    through her own dexterity. She made curtains for all the windows,
    slip covers for the summer furniture, and even fashioned end tables
    by garbing actual orange crates in stylish custom-made (by her)
    cloth coverings. I still remember how, after cleaning up the place,
    we drove into town to stock our larder and complete our equipment
    for housekeeping. We really loaded up the car and were sure we had
    everything, but we had to make a return trip for a broom and a trash
    can! Thereupon we sat down to Kathleen&rsquo;s first home-cooked
    meal (which turned out to be her second, third, nth!): something
    plus boiled potatoes and sliced tomatoes. Midway through our second
    week I suggested to her that there were other ways to fix potatoes,
    and other vegetables besides tomatoes. Still, we were very, very
    happy.</p>
  <p class="western">It was hard, too, for us to believe that the
    world was still at war. There were shortages and rationing, but that
    hardly bothered us. We were together at last. The Battle of Salerno
    came and went. We missed it. Then FDR went to Teheran to meet with
    Stalin and Churchill. It seems weird that we must leave it to Stalin
    to pinpoint the single most important key to allied success in WWII.
    This he did in a memorable toast to FDR at Teheran:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I want to tell you, from the Russian point
    of view, what the President of the United States has done to win the
    war. The most important things in this war are machines. The United
    States has proven that it can turn out from eight thousand to ten
    thousand airplanes per month. Russia can turn out, at most, three
    thousand airplanes per month. England turns out three thousand to
    thirty-five hundred, which are principally heavy bombers. The United
    States, therefore, is a country of machines. Without these machines,
    <i>through Lend-Lease</i> [my emphasis added)], we would lose the
    war.</p>
  <p class="western">Amen! There can be no doubt in the mind of any
    American who has ever viewed the tremendous quantities of heavy
    equipment simply abandoned at war&rsquo;s end on Pacific atolls, or
    our huge moth-balled fleets, or the vast arrays of planes lined up
    in Arizona deserts, that we simply machined the enemy to death.
    (This also suggests the basis of the seeming paranoia of the USSR
    even today with the numbers of weapons aligned against them on
    European soil.) At the same time, reading wartime military leaders&rsquo;
    memoirs will equally well assure one and all that military
    leadership or genius had virtually no part in our victory, even as
    augmented by phenomenal intelligence breakthroughs. Our unthreatened
    home industry won WWII.</p>
  <p class="western">The year 1944 started with the Anzio landing.
    Kathleen and I were enjoying Saturday night Steak Nights at the
    Naval Academy Officers&rsquo; Club. Then came the retaking of Saipan
    and Guam in the Pacific, even as Overlord was launched on 6 Jun 1944
    in Europe. (Tuscaloosa did herself proud. Morison reports, &ldquo;A
    powerful factor in breaking down German resistance at Utah was
    abundant and accurate naval gunfire support &hellip; directed by
    RAdm. Morton Deyo in heavy cruiser Tuscaloosa.&rdquo; Morison goes
    on, &ldquo;When General Gerow set up headquarters on the beach, his
    first message to General Bradley, still aboard Augusta, was: &lsquo;Thank
    God for the U.S. Navy!&rsquo;&rdquo;) Of course I heard about the
    invasion on the radio while having breakfast, prior to just another
    day at PG school. I must confess, this was the one time during the
    war that I did really feel guilty about my having it so good.</p>
  <p class="western">On June 12&ndash;13 the first V 1 cruise missile
    buzz-bombs started zinging into London neighborhoods, and these were
    followed on 8 Sep 1944 by the first V 2 rockets raining on London.
    MacArthur himself splashed ashore at long last on the Philippine
    shore on 20 October. The battle of the Philippine Sea was already
    history (19&ndash;21 Jun) and the battle of Leyte Gulf was in
    progress. My greatest hardship throughout this entire period was to
    affix my signature on 17 Apr 1944 to an agreement to serve in the
    U.S. Navy at least three years after the conclusion of my PG
    training. And, oh yes, there was another sinister development in the
    war. The first kamikaze suicide pilots showed up in October of 1944,
    and were to continue to harass the Pacific Fleet with devastating
    results until 22 Jun 1945. I find it extremely difficult to so much
    as hint that I&rsquo;m sorry that I just barely missed all this. I
    wasn&rsquo;t running away, but neither am I stupid. I thank God for
    all my blessings, and most especially this first year-and-a-half of
    shoreside married life.</p>
  <p class="western">Speaking of blessings, 18 Nov 1944 marked a truly
    blessed event &ndash; the birth of our first child, our son, George
    &ndash; a mere six days after the sinking of our old nemesis, the
    Tirpitz. He arrived on a Saturday afternoon, between halves of the
    Navy&ndash;Notre Dame game. I had delivered Kathleen to the hospital
    earlier and was listening to the game on the radio while awaiting
    developments. The hospital called just about halftime, and told me
    the great news. I responded that I&rsquo;d be over as soon as the
    game was over. (Do you suppose that&rsquo;s why George has no
    disposition for sports to this day?) Aw, come on! Did you really
    believe that? What they told me was to give her an hour or so to
    rest up before barging in on her.</p>
  <p class="western">I confess, for my part, I don&rsquo;t remember
    ever returning to the game. I have no idea who even won, let alone
    the score. My mind was completely transformed. I felt different &ndash;
    like I felt being a father must show so much that it was like I&rsquo;d
    even glow in the dark. It was just a tremendous feeling. Perhaps
    George Bernard Shaw has summed it up best: &ldquo;Life is a flame
    that is always burning itself out, but it catches fire again every
    time a child is born.&rdquo; And I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with
    hard-nosed economist Paul Samuelson&rsquo;s confession that, &ldquo;I
    think having children is the biggest kick in life.&rdquo; It was a
    time for praising God and giving thanks.</p>
  <p class="western">Soon I was off to the hospital, and there, over
    the course of the next few days, Kathleen had some very interesting
    stories to tell. Her main worry had been that nobody would be
    available to help with the delivery when George finally made his
    move. It seems they parked her, all alone and well off the beaten
    track, in some remote dark corner of the hospital to wait out her
    labor. She was afraid they might have forgotten she was there or
    where she was. She further recalls that she couldn&rsquo;t dwell on
    this concern too much, however, because some fellow laborer in some
    other remote corner kept screaming, &ldquo;Charlie! Get off!&rdquo;
    It seems this greatly amused hospital personnel, since the young
    lady&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s name was Dave.</p>
  <p class="western">Kathleen&rsquo;s final recollection is even more
    bizarre. Shortly after George was born, she was visited in her
    hospital room by a very young girl who strangely questioned her
    about her baby&rsquo;s sex. Upon being told it was a boy, the little
    girl shrieked with delight. It seems that the girl suffered from
    severe facial burns from some accident and, every time a new male
    was circumcised, the little girl received another healing skin
    graft. The circumcised flesh was especially valuable for this facial
    surgery since it is virtually the only male skin that is totally
    hairless. Live and learn.</p>
  <p class="western">Nothing in life really prepares you for the shock
    of taking your first offspring home, and suddenly finding yourselves
    there alone with total responsibility for its enduring welfare. And,
    let&rsquo;s face it! You can&rsquo;t learn parenting by reading a
    book anymore than you can learn to swim. You&rsquo;ve got to jump in
    the water! It is downright scary. I can still remember our first
    night with George. One or the other of us was popping up all night
    long to check on him &ndash; first because he was making noise, then
    because he wasn&rsquo;t. Somehow, he survived. After all, as some
    wag as remarked, &ldquo;To heir is human.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Certainly it has to be the most incomparable of
    all human experiences. As hundreds of parents must have said since
    Henry Ward Beecher, &ldquo;We never know the love of the parent till
    we become parents ourselves. So it is that parental love soon
    overcomes parental ignorance. The loved child doesn&rsquo;t merely
    endure, it thrives.&rdquo; So it was with George. One of the very
    first rules we made was to maintain our normal environment. Thus, we
    never spoke in whispers or tiptoed around the house, and we kept our
    radio (which was almost always tuned to good music) at its normal
    volume setting. We agreed he would have to adjust to our natural
    ambiance, we weren&rsquo;t going to adapt to his whims. It seemed to
    work out OK. In fact, who can say George&rsquo;s love for music
    didn&rsquo;t actually start while he was still in the crib?</p>
  <p class="western">This happy little sojourn was to be short-lived.
    The Battle of the Bulge burst the allied front in Europe on 16
    December. Patton arrived to bail out Bastogne on 26 December, and
    the Germans&rsquo; final advance was stopped once and for all on 28
    December. It was on 23 December that I was detached from the PG
    school with orders to report by 22 Jan 1945 as Assistant Engineer
    Officer to the brand new light cruiser, USS Amsterdam, then fitting
    out in Norfolk, Virginia. Hey, that sounded like a good deal, right?
    I&rsquo;d be enjoying 30 days leave over Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s.
    Wrong! On Christmas day I got Western Union orders to report to
    Philadelphia, 31 Dec to 20 Jan, to attend Damage Control School.
    Perhaps this will help Mary to understand why I counsel &ldquo;Never
    count on anything in the military!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">It&rsquo;s also why I counsel (with Lt. LaForce),
    &ldquo;Take all the leave you can, <i>whenever</i> you can.&rdquo;
    (You&rsquo;ll still lose unused leave in the end, and there are no
    quid quo pro contractual promises for sacrificing leave
    opportunities in the military.) Needless to say, though, this really
    enraged me, even though I had to admit it made sense. The ship must
    have figured, &ldquo;Hell! He&rsquo;s been on shore duty for 18
    months, and we&rsquo;re getting ready to face kamikazes in the
    Pacific.&rdquo; Regardless of what they thought, or what I thought,
    I went to Philadelphia. I still managed to wangle weekend leaves
    while I was there, and even inveigled my way out of the big
    final-day damage-control exercise in which they set fire to and
    actually flooded a full-scale ship model for practice purposes.
    Despite all this copping out, I managed a 3.5 and stood #3 in a
    class of 36 (which perhaps proves that the less I&rsquo;m around,
    the better impression I make).</p>
  <p class="western">This seems the proper time to splice into this
    more or less chronological saga with a substantial accounting of our
    family life. After all, the most significant events of the period
    just related were the establishment of our very first home, and the
    birth of our very first child. Meanwhile George, as a phrase I&rsquo;ve
    read somewhere (Lk 2:40) goes, grew in size and strength, filled
    with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. As some of you will
    recall, Kathleen and I subscribed fully to the dictum variously
    attributed to Rudyard Kipling or as a Jesuit saying, but perhaps
    best enunciated by St. Francis Xavier, &ldquo;Give me a child for
    the first seven years, and you may do what you like with him
    afterward.&rdquo; (Jesuits are commonly reported as saying, &ldquo;Give
    me your son from one to six and you can have the man.&rdquo; But a
    specific Jesuit, Joseph Kurismmootil, really captures the thought
    when he notes, &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s fate, his nobility and all his
    degradation are molded by decisions he has already made by the age
    of five&rdquo;! All parents, hear, hear!)</p>
  <p class="western">Maybe this wisdom isn&rsquo;t as well known as it
    should be. Consider a 6 Mar 1984 news clipping: In an eight-year,
    $485,000 study, a research team directed by Dr. Francis A. J. Ianni,
    a professor at Teachers College of Columbia University, found that
    while urban, suburban, and rural teenagers all enjoy the fashions of
    the youth culture, most rely on their parents to interpret life.
    Well (expletive deleted)! The article then goes on to elaborate how
    300 teenagers, 15 anthropologists, sociologists and mental health
    professionals discovered that children learned values from parents,
    not from their peers. In the immortal words of Amos and Andy, &ldquo;Oh,
    Wow!&rdquo; Hey, there&rsquo;s more! Harvard political scientist
    James Q. Wilson is quoted as saying, &ldquo;Good parents are needed
    to raise good kids&rdquo;! Really makes you think, doesn&rsquo;t it?
    And you, my dear children, thought your old foggy folks were really
    out of it. Shame!</p>
  <p class="western">We were also committed to the notion that if you
    give your #1 offspring your best shot, then all subsequent children
    will follow suit. Perhaps our third and final major principle was
    one that we just fell into naturally, without ever having formalized
    it, and it was that mother would represent mercy, and father would
    represent justice, but that in all events one would always support
    the commitments of the other. And just one more thing, for sure. We
    were dedicated to our home being a home built upon love &ndash; one
    our children would always want to come back to visit. Visions of my
    own parents were still very vivid. My Mom and Dad were OK when they
    were apart! But together? They were like two scorpions in a bottle.
    No! They were more like the two gladiators of old, each with one
    hand tied to the other, leaving each with one hand swinging free as
    a weapon. The only difference was my Pop didn&rsquo;t hit back. As
    with Monty Python, our resolve was to do something completely
    different.</p>
  <p class="western">Moving beyond basic principles, we strove
    mightily to translate them into practical habits. After all,
    principles are inanimate ideas, whereas life is real-time action. As
    a corollary to setting up habit patterns, we tried to integrate them
    as naturally as possible into the regular rhythm of life, rather
    than impose them as some extraneous appendage to conduct. For
    example, to try to instill a constant awareness of God as the
    pre-eminent force in their lives, we made sure there was a crucifix
    in each room, we installed holy water fonts at each outside door to
    remind the children (as well as ourselves) that we go and come by
    God&rsquo;s grace. Then, too, we installed a striking clock, and
    provided the example of shouting our &ldquo;Glory be to God!&rdquo;
    as each half-hour was sounded. We made sure that religious reading
    material appropriate to the varying ages of the children was always
    not only at hand but in plain sight.</p>
  <p class="western">At Christmas each child was given one inside toy
    or game, one outside toy or game, and one religion-oriented gift.
    Also, we put on Christmas plays, making our own props, and never
    taught the myth of Santa Claus. Similarly, we celebrated
    name-day/feast-days rather than birthdays. We tried every way we
    could think of to make religion &ndash; consciousness of God&rsquo;s
    presence in all our lives &ndash; part and parcel of the daily
    living routine. Admittedly, the jury is still out on the enduring
    efficacy of all of this. We just knew no better way to translate our
    ideas of life priorities into day-to day praxis. No doubt, we made
    mistakes. (Reality often skewers intentions, as witness how often
    prostitutes seemingly are the daughters of ministers.)</p>
  <p class="western">We also placed great emphasis on doing things as
    a family, and tried to develop a series of happy traditions. Thus we
    arranged fairly regular forays to Hains Point, to climb in the
    trees, and to Rock Creek Park to walk on (or more often fall off of)
    the rocks strewing the streams there. We&rsquo;d go to parks,
    museums, memorials, and other public places of interest. As the
    children grew older, we instituted regular summer trips to Mayo
    Beach (encountering numerous multi-colored darbs en route), with
    inner-tubes for all, and sand-augmented peanut butter sandwiches.
    Will anyone ever forget the day Big-Winner-Moni was run off the slot
    machines for being underage, or our first on-site enjoyment of a
    real live rock band?</p>
  <p class="western">This tradition soon gave way to annual forays to
    Ocean City. First there was the Shoreham (and our separate tables at
    Melvin&rsquo;s), then Mr. Steinmetz, then across the street to the
    Seacrest. Will anyone ever forget the nightly lynchings of poor
    John&rsquo;s vulture? Then we graduated for a few years to the
    Stowaway with a pool! Finally we advanced to the Quality Inn at 17th
    Street. Will anybody deny we haven&rsquo;t had some great family
    vacations? Hey! We&rsquo;ve had people join us from as far away as
    Texas and even California, and sometimes the crowd has even required
    adjoining connecting apartments.</p>
  <p class="western">Our children, of course, bring a somewhat
    different perspective to family childhood memories. Chesterton
    provides a possibly explanatory insight: &ldquo;Children are
    innocent and love justice, while most adults are wicked and prefer
    mercy.&rdquo; First they recall the alarm clock on the dinner table.
    If vegetables weren&rsquo;t disposed of by the time it rang, such
    culprits got no dessert. This fiendish regimen provoked a series of
    disappearing peas stratagems. (Peas were a particularly despised
    vegetable because, as KT could so graphically demonstrate,
    swallowing them makes your head move.) So we had the old
    hide-the-peas-under-the-rim-of-the-plate trick, the
    stuff-the-peas-into-the-mashed-potatoes trick (since one didn&rsquo;t
    have to consume all starches), or the
    peas-in-the-bottom-of-the-milk-glass trick. No doubt there were many
    more which are still classified information. Anne was especially
    marked by the alarm clock routine, thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I was just learning the difference between
    the color gold and the color silver. (If you think this is
    unrelated, for God&rsquo;s sake be patient.) As you may remember,
    those are the toughest to get straight because they were unwittingly
    left out of Roy G. Biv. One night I was sitting at the dinner table
    expanding my consciousness with the startling discovery that I would
    never again confuse gold and silver. I had just discovered that
    silver was by an incredible coincidence the color of silverware. So
    gold must be the other one. What an amazing discovery! As I was
    silently congratulating myself for embarking on a career of
    marvelous creative thought, the aforementioned alarm clock went off.
    Imagine the immense psychological damage!</p>
  <p class="western">The predilection of children for justice alluded
    to above is borne out by another of Anne&rsquo;s recollections:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I remember that you (your author) used to
    inspect the bathroom after we would take a bath, and you would buy a
    toy for the person who did the best job of cleaning. There is a very
    early memory of a 3&times;5 card on the inside of the upstairs
    bathroom at Dallas Avenue. (This is one even your author had
    forgotten.) Apparently you would keep a running (weekly?) score, and
    the prize went to the best composite. If you can date this barbaric
    practice, you will probably have some appreciation of how much it
    marked some of us. Now, everybody has sad stories of being compared
    to older siblings by elementary school teachers and unfeeling
    parents. Especially anybody with an older sibling like George. But
    imagine the problems it has created for me to have one of my first
    conscious memories of my big brother being awarded a plastic boat as
    a bath toy for passing inspection better than I. I bet I was all of
    two years old. I was so crushed that I marvel that I ever made it to
    three years old (or did I skip three years? I&rsquo;m sure George
    must have skipped several years.)</p>
  <p class="western">Of course George had his traumas, too. These
    three must date from circa 1951, because Martha was still a
    vegetable. We had a summer cabin near Deep Creek Lake at New
    Germany, Maryland, way out in the western panhandle. One day George
    ventured out into the surrounding woods alone and then came roaring
    back into the cabin because he had stumbled upon and was being
    chased by a snake. Now I, for one, didn&rsquo;t take this lightly,
    because it was only a day or so later that he and I ventured up a
    nearby mountain together, only to suddenly race each other madly
    down the hill before what we considered to be a stampeding herd of
    wild mountain goats. (We were definitely not outdoor types at that
    point in time, and I never made the conversion.)</p>
  <p class="western">Finally there was the ultimate trauma for George
    as we made ready to depart this pastoral paradise. Holy Moses! He
    couldn&rsquo;t find his pet stuffed elephant. This was tantamount to
    Linus losing his blanket. We won&rsquo;t even mention the plethora
    of lesser crises of our first and last venture into the primitive
    life, such as George turning over steppingstone slabs to frighten
    Anne by revealing the host of creeping, crawling uglies thereunder;
    or trampling Anne to death in a dash up into the loft upon our
    arrival to commandeer the best bunk; or the nightly sounds of the
    mouse patrol attacking our foodstuffs, which ultimately had to be
    stored in the oven to preclude penetration. Lastly, amidst the great
    multiplicity of Be Careful of Forest Fire signs, I don&rsquo;t
    remember Pioneer Papa ever managing to get a fire going in the
    fireplace.</p>
  <p class="western">The main memory of our junior family (Mary
    through Herbie) about our senior family (George through John) seems
    to be George&rsquo;s shooting of Anne with a home-made zip gun.
    This, as I recollect, he fashioned after a design found in a library
    book!<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote35anc" href="#sdendnote35sym"><sup>35</sup></a>
    (And they ban Tom Sawyer in some places!) Thank God he never
    discovered a book I once found in the library that detailed
    primitive underground-resistance weapons such as do-it-yourself
    derailing devices and Molotov cocktails. (PLEASE, don&rsquo;t anyone
    tell me if he did!) I guess none of the kids were old enough to
    remember George pressing a blazing automobile cigar lighter to
    Anne&rsquo;s cheek in the moment it took me to dash into a store to
    pick up a newspaper. (George, I think you&rsquo;ll agree that Anne
    owes you a few.) And Anne wasn&rsquo;t the only one to suffer
    because of George. Moni still blisters at the recollection of having
    to run all the way home from Judy Ericson&rsquo;s just to say
    goodbye when he was leaving for the Naval Academy. Lucky for George,
    though, Charlie came along and took off some of the heat. Well, not
    really, I mean did anyone inherit Kathleen&rsquo;s temper to the
    extent that son Charlie did? You say you don&rsquo;t remember
    Charlie&rsquo;s temper? Who taught you to ride a bike?</p>
  <p class="western">Here&rsquo;s a string of short memories for you:
    Kathleen packing ice cube trays in newspapers for the trips to Mayo
    before they invented Styrofoam; Dad inflating 6 to 8 inner-tubes at
    the Texaco station just short of Mayo; Anne dropping one of Dad&rsquo;s
    lead weights on Charlie&rsquo;s foot; Moni demolishing John&rsquo;s
    ego by besting him in street foot races; John getting through a
    whole session of lights-out hide-and-seek by hiding on top of the
    braces under the dining room table; KT breaking the big BVM statue
    one night when she was playing with it instead of sleeping; Mo just
    always being little; Snork stories; Moni being afraid of the dark;
    multi-colored darbs [Charlie recalls these as multi-<i>crudded</i>
    darbs, for what it&rsquo;s worth]; being sent to bed before dark on
    summer evenings if caught running through a sprinkler with your
    clothes on; Mary having to race from steps to street and back so Dad
    could see if her feet turned out; being sprinkled with a hose with
    your clothes on, by Dad on hot nights when he didn&rsquo;t want to
    have to sweat over giving baths; later, older kids giving younger
    kids baths; Dad turning his watch over on his wrist en route to Mayo
    so Maureen (who was not allowed to ask, How much longer?) couldn&rsquo;t
    see it; sleeping on the floor under the pull-down seats of the
    DeSoto on the way back from Mayo; Dad distributing the little guest
    soaps he brought home from trips; eating bugs and dirt by just
    riding in the DeSoto convertible;</p>

  <p class="text-first-western">breakfast at a restaurant alone with
    Mom and Dad on First Communion Day; Monica&rsquo;s so-becoming red
    eyeglasses; that supreme mortal sin &ndash; <i>spilling milk at the
      table</i> - and the consequent total silence promenade to the
    inevitable hand slap; being splashed with Bronze Tan at Mayo or
    Ocean City but then having to wait an hour after eating before going
    into the water; KT rushing home from school to play teacher but
    (what a drag!) having to hold it down once Dad showed up; Charlie
    tapping at the table until Dad yelled; Charlie and John shouting
    into their pillows at night until drawing a &lsquo;Knock it off or
    I&rsquo;ll flatten you!&rsquo;; Mary thumping through the house on
    her very favorite red-shoes shoe board; Kathleen&rsquo;s
    pre-hospital lists for everything (like the one for operating the
    washer and drier which was so detailed that it began with, &lsquo;Turn
    on the light in the furnace room,&rsquo; but one of which neglected
    to warn Anne to pour off the grease before mixing in the meat with
    the spaghetti sauce!); and ambulances for taking Kathleen to the
    hospital. (It was a family status symbol. Nobody else in the
    neighborhood got such service, certainly not on such a regular
    basis!)</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">Ready? Who built
    the Karnack at Thebes? Who discovered Baffin Bay? Who was
    Champollion? Now there&rsquo;s a list of Wright authenticators to
    equal &lsquo;What happened to the man with the fur coat?&rsquo;! Or
    perhaps you remember, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t examine it!&rdquo; (What
    was it, a phone?) Anne, remember Kathleen&rsquo;s final crucial
    instruction before leaving for the hospital: Don&rsquo;t ever run
    out of milk when Charlie is expected home! Anne recalls she got the
    feeling that it was sort of on a par (in terms of dire consequences)
    with the admonition to Lot: &ldquo;Don t look back!&rdquo; On the
    other hand, others recall that when Kathleen went to the hospital
    was the only time that the clothes hamper was completely emptied and
    the stove got a complete cleaning, as the great organizer, Dad, took
    over. Oh, and remember the chores: carry-out, rinse and load, pans,
    kid-to-bed, sweep, and the inevitable trade-offs? And could you ever
    forget what drag it was when the guy at the sink had to give way to
    Grandma to wet her rag to wipe down the table which had already just
    been wiped down by the carry-out guy! Memories.</p>
  <p class="western">To be sure, some memories were at once a little
    more complex and little more personal. Martha recalls how I would
    sit alone in the living room sipping bourbon whenever Kathleen was
    out for an evening (she said it was to Sodality!?!), and &ldquo;You
    would sometimes let your hair down.&rdquo; She especially recalls my
    revealing how I once discussed sex with my Dad after my honeymoon,
    and how I assured one and all they could always come to me about
    anything. She confesses that she was deeply touched. On a similar
    occasion she recalls how I once discoursed on how bad off Kathleen
    was at Herbie&rsquo;s birth, and how I disclosed that the Doctor had
    then indicated to me that another pregnancy could end in death and
    that something akin to abstinence was indicated, but that this had
    strangely brought Kathleen and I more close together. Martha again
    was touched, but at the same time she was incensed at a Church she
    felt was kicking us when we were down. (How disparate the perception
    of age and youth.) There is a point to be made here, however, one
    shouldn&rsquo;t (in Graham Greene&rsquo;s great phrase) go through
    life clutching dogmas as though passports to heaven.</p>
  <p class="western">Monica recalls accidentally breaking the switch
    on my living room reading lamp, and then frightenedly lurking out of
    sight in a nearby room until I discovered it. She remembers the
    fear, too, with which she responded to my yell of, &ldquo;Who did
    it?&rdquo; She slunk slowly into the room, expecting the worst, and
    confessed. She was shocked, she recalls, when I didn&rsquo;t say a
    thing, but quietly went upstairs only to return a minute later with
    a handful of small change which I silently presented to her. She
    remembers well the reward accruing to the virtue of truth. Maureen
    recalls a somewhat similar surprise. Charlie had been teaching her
    to ride a bicycle (which, as anybody who knows Charlie realizes, is
    a euphemism for turning you loose with the thundering command:
    RIDE!!!) It seems she immediately spun-in and badly skinned a knee,
    embedding sand and gravel in the wound. You can imagine her dismay
    when I then angrily confronted her at the front door. It really
    hurt, as her tearful explanation made clear. Imagine her surprise
    (and appreciation) then, when instead of lighting into her, I took
    off rather after Charlie and chewed him out. Apparently, I sometimes
    (even if accidentally) did the right thing.</p>
  <p class="western">It is nevertheless fascinating how the concept of
    justice seems to be the overriding concern of youth. (This,
    certainly, is something all new parents would be well advised to
    keep in mind.) For example, Mary still pouts at the recollection of
    how she once got clobbered when it was Charlie and John who were
    lighting matches against all orders about playing with matches. To
    prove her innocence, Mary will demonstrate how she herself can&rsquo;t
    even light a match to this very day. In like vein, Anne is still
    nursing the wounds of a chastisement for prematurely opening a
    Ginny-doll Christmas present while still not-so-secretly cached in
    the furnace room. She still luxuriates in a vivid Technicolor image
    of George constructing a fiendish frame-up. It&rsquo;s not too
    preposterous to suspect that upon completion of her legal studies
    she may yet haul him into court for defamation of character.
    (Kathleen always suspected Charlie or Johnny.<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote37anc" href="#sdendnote37sym"><sup>37</sup></a>)</p>
  <p class="western">In the second place, beyond justice, a dominant
    concern of our offspring was apparently fear. Especially among the
    younger girls this is a frequently recurring refrain. This fear
    centered on what they uniformly sum up as the chair. It seems that
    when I really wanted to lower the boom, they were invited to a spot
    beside my desk, and told to draw up a chair and sit facing me
    without moving. Sometimes we&rsquo;d talk. Sometimes I&rsquo;d talk.
    Sometimes I&rsquo;d just turn aside to work at my desk and they&rsquo;d
    just sit there, immobile, for what seemed like hours. Any whimper or
    movement would bring a devastating look from me. Maureen has the
    memory of getting the chair for being caught riding her bicycle on
    University Blvd. during rush hour. So, it seems I invoked the chair
    when the children needlessly hazarded life threatening situations.
    Maureen (and no doubt Mary, too, about which more later) also
    remembers Mary getting the chair upon revelation of her pregnancy.
    (Well, clearly, some discussion was indicated.)</p>
  <p class="western">It is ridiculous to go on, I suppose, everyone
    has their favorite best and worst memories, and what I&rsquo;m
    attempting here is to hint at the flavor of the personality that I
    evidently appeared to be to my children. I&rsquo;m the
    not-so-innocent bystander in this situation. Everything I&rsquo;ve
    presented on this point is necessarily hearsay. But, I think a
    picture does emerge. My children were alternately proud and
    embarrassed by me. <i>E.g.</i>: Good grief, my Dad played the drums
    while other kids&rsquo; Dads were Lutheran Ministers. I screamed
    hate into my pillow, then bragged to my friends. We never really
    bickered, tattled, or held any grudges. We even got to vote on a
    name for the child. I picked Jerome, but it turned out to be a girl.
    I not only had to wipe up every ounce of the broken jam jar, I was
    called back to rinse out the rag. I discovered I liked potato salad.
    (What Dad fixed, you ate!) I was awed when I heard you say Sir on
    the phone to Balboa Hospital, and I was so touched when you cried at
    Herbie&rsquo;s funeral. I was really impressed when I asked if I
    could smoke and you said you&rsquo;d stop if I wouldn&rsquo;t start
    and you did! I loved cuddling up to you to watch TV like I later on
    was delighted to see you doing with Laurie. I was so relieved when
    you consoled me on the way home from the Police Station for that car
    sleep-out by saying, &ldquo;Hey! I went through this with all the
    rest.&rdquo; I loved those family chats over luncheon at Leonie&rsquo;s.
    I was appalled when a nun phoned about my school attitude and you
    gave me a long lecture on the virtues of &ldquo;brown-nosing.&rdquo;
    I was so thrilled by your telling a nun your mouth had been open
    while in the first communion line because you were &ldquo;catching
    flies.&rdquo; That made you my #1 role model.</p>
  <p class="western">All the foregoing is just generalized background.
    Perhaps a few personal notes are in order at this point. Allowance
    must be made for a failing parental memory in this respect, but it
    has been augmented to some extent by many marvelous letters which
    our children have volunteered to us over the years. We&rsquo;ve
    already covered George&rsquo;s origin in some detail. No doubt he&rsquo;ll
    be thrilled to learn he shares the same birth date as movie star,
    Marcello Mastrioanni. Perhaps this accounts for his savoir faire,
    his suaveness. Certainly he didn&rsquo;t inherit that from me. In
    fact, George relied on me for very little. In contrast to the debt I
    owed my father for his tremendous assistance in gaining my
    admittance to the Naval Academy, George arranged virtually
    everything himself. Indeed, I was unaware of any such disposition
    toward the Academy until he had actually begun formal preparations,
    as through passing an unofficial preliminary vision exam as
    conducted at the U.S. Naval Dispensary in the old Main Navy Building
    where I then worked on Constitution Avenue. This he did on 21 Mar
    1961.</p>
  <p class="western">The very idea of George going Navy struck me as a
    complete surprise. I certainly never pushed it, in fact, I don&rsquo;t
    even remember ever talking much about the Navy, positively or
    otherwise. Nor do I remember him ever actually voicing any such
    interest prior to his overt preparation. He passed an official
    preliminary (but complete) USNA physical exam at the Bethesda Naval
    Medical Center<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote38anc" href="#sdendnote38sym"><sup>38</sup></a>
    on 20 Jun 1961, to which he returned from Balboa Naval Hospital on 1
    Dec 1968. So it might be legitimately stated that George&rsquo;s
    naval career both began and ended at Bethesda. Similarly, it could
    be said his married life began there, since that is where he met his
    future wife, Navy nurse, Lt. Pat Brady. (The real Bethesda,
    interestingly enough, is a spring-fed pool in the North quarter of
    old Jerusalem, made famous by Christ&rsquo;s curing of a paralytic.
    Our new Bethesda certainly helped heal George.)</p>
  <p class="western">I think our family has always regarded George as
    our resident genius. He had qualified scholastically for USNA
    admission by the end of his junior year in high school. Also, he
    took his college boards as a junior, and stood in the top 2% of all
    seniors who took the exams that year. Clearly, he did take after his
    Dad in the academic realm. Oh yeez! He wasn&rsquo;t bad in the
    athletic realm either (though his sons may never believe it) having
    been a member of the city-wide CYO champion football team while
    still in the 7th grade. This promising career was cut short by the
    onset of Osgood-Schlatter&rsquo;s disease. Gotcha? That&rsquo;s
    degeneration of a natural protuberance on the knee-end of the tibia,
    the long bone of the lower leg, you fool. (Let&rsquo;s hope George
    had it only in the leg bone since shed at Bethesda!)</p>
  <p class="western">George also placed second in an area-wide
    spelling bee as a 6th grader. Everyone is familiar with his feats of
    teaching himself to type, and to read music, and learning to play
    every musical instrument in the guitar, saxophone, and clarinet
    families, not to mention the flute. I said, don&rsquo;t mention the
    flute! But it&rsquo;s too late as son Matthew (and his cousin,
    Terri) are already into the flute. Then, too, son Bobby is already
    into the guitar (and bass), and son Michael has already had a bout
    with the alto sax. So, the beat goes on! If I failed to incorporate
    any childhood memories by George himself, it&rsquo;s merely because
    George never really was a child. He was born an adult.</p>
  <p class="western">You don&rsquo;t believe that? Well, just draw up
    a chair and read an excerpt from his letter, written 22 Apr 1964 as
    a USNA third-classman (sophomore!), to Martha on the occasion of her
    winning a scholarship. Prescinding from his egregious error of
    extolling her at the outset as having done something none of your
    family or even your relations have done, (and of course we now know
    that super-Dad also attended high school on scholarship, and
    super-Mom won a two-year scholarship to Dunbarton College) George
    displayed wisdom beyond his chronological age. He wrote:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">If you&rsquo;ll permit me to offer some
    sage advice based upon long years of astute observation and
    first-hand experience: pay special attention to your religion
    courses. There is a terrible tendency for many young people to get
    an exaggerated sense of their own importance. This leads them to an
    agnosticism in which they presume to pronounce on any philosophy or
    religion (even though they may be getting D&rsquo;s and F&rsquo;s in
    math, history, etc.). The only cure for such an attitude is a
    religious faith. Unfortunately, such people always adopt a sneering
    attitude that such childish beliefs are ridiculous. Although such
    agnostic over-self-confidence is probably more widespread among
    boys, it becomes truly obnoxious in girls.</p>
  <p class="western">Hear! Hear! I wish I had said that. I might also
    add that I&rsquo;m afraid this tendency to place an inflationary
    value on one&rsquo;s own youthfully evolved opinions is perhaps even
    more highly prevalent today. Today it is fashionable to the point of
    chic to belittle and ridicule religion a la Monty Python&rsquo;s
    <i>Holy Grail</i> and <i>Life of Brian</i> shticks. (Thus, some
    young parents of today consider it enlightened not to give their
    offspring any religious indoctrination, lest they taint the kids&rsquo;
    free choice. They might as well let a kid take out his or her own
    appendix.)</p>
  <p class="western">George wrote another memorable letter betraying
    trenchant maturity, but that might be expected of one who has the
    same birthday as Thomist philosopher-theologian, Jacques Maritain.
    This letter, written 5 Feb 1966, is addressed, Dear Dad. Once again
    I take issue only with his opening observation. He wrote:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I remember thinking once when I was in high
    school of you: the man certainly has his faults but he has an
    extraordinary capacity for distinguishing importance from
    inconsequentials, for thinking straight. Evidently you recognized
    and expected thoughts such as these, for you warned me that it was
    common for young men to over-estimate their fathers.</p>
  <p class="western">What George failed to mention, of course, is that
    I must have added, present company excepted. All kidding aside, I
    confess that I was always impressed by St. Thomas Aquinas&rsquo;
    method in which he began his response to every issue with <i>Distinguo</i>
    &ndash; I distinguish! And in line with George&rsquo;s proposition
    that I have an extraordinary capacity to distinguish importance, I
    must state right here that the balance of this letter (recounting an
    extended cruise in a nuclear atom-bomb-armed submarine) warrants
    incorporation in full at this point, without further inane editorial
    comments from me, thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">It is very sobering for a twenty-year-old
    young man, this particular one at least, to be so completely
    isolated in the manner I was this summer. For seventy-two days I was
    in my own little four-hundred-and-twenty-foot world, and it had its
    effect in more ways than one. I think it took a little while before
    the significance of our strategic employment and the sixteen
    missiles sunk in. We had periodic weapons system readiness tests, to
    keep us on our toes, I guess. About twice a month we would get an
    alert message from ComSubLant and only the radiomen and the OOD
    would know if it were real or not. I hope the melodrama of all this
    doesn&rsquo;t completely obscure what I&rsquo;m trying to say.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Once I was overpowered by the fear that
    this might not be a drill. But it was, of course, and how easily
    that &ldquo;of course&rdquo; comes now. I was still unable to go to
    sleep, and for the next six hours I just lay in the truly absolute
    privacy of my curtained-off rack in the cool, dark PO&rsquo;s
    quarters in the truly absolute privacy of my own thoughts. Well let
    me tell you those few hours eliminated any faith I might have had in
    deductive reasoning, for thoughts without facts to guide them can
    really run wild. Wasn&rsquo;t it Descartes who pointed out that
    clear and concise reasoning is by no means correct reasoning on its
    own strength? But again, I digress; I must have learned it from you
    (your author).</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I thought about the possible significance
    that a real alert would have. It was &ndash; well &ndash; it was
    just an exhausting, draining thought to realize that a missile shoot
    would mean you and any other acquaintances of mine outside our inch
    of HY80 steel would be dead. Please don&rsquo;t suspect that I was
    just over-excited by the prospect of real guns and realistic war
    games. I learned a better respect for war and peace then than the
    average pacifist with an introduction-to-philosophy course under his
    belt, I can assure you.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">But, to try again, more than anything else
    I felt remorse. Remorse for never having said things and done things
    I would have liked to have said and done had the alert been real. It
    should be pleasing to you, I guess, to read that most of all I felt
    sorry that I had never thanked you and Mom. No! That&rsquo;s not
    true. Most of all I regretted never having really tried to thank you
    and Mom. And I shall not try to enumerate anything in support of my
    contention that I owe you both many thanks; I will just say that if
    you have any confidence in my ability to judge objectively, and in
    my sense of values, you will respect the fact that to me (and I say
    &lsquo;to me&rsquo; just to limit my statement to things I know
    something about, i.e., construe &lsquo;to me&rsquo; to mean as far
    as your relations with me alone) to me, you and Mom have been better
    parents than any of my contemporaries&rsquo; parents have been to
    them.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">That is to say, while you and Mom are not
    faultless, you have less to wish had been otherwise than any other
    father and mother I know. If that is true or not I don&rsquo;t
    really know. I only know that it seems that way to me, and for that
    I thank you. I thank you because it inspires me. Not that I will
    narrowly try to emulate you, I just feel inspired, that&rsquo;s all;
    and for that I thank you. This page, needless to say, I consider
    important. I hope the fact that I didn&rsquo;t mention it until I
    had finished it didn&rsquo;t cause you to minimize it. I had
    intended to write more introduction. There were many things I wanted
    to say first, I suspect mainly because I thought they looked very
    profound when I wrote them to Mom. But they were so much
    introduction anyway and not really important. I just wanted to write
    as fast as my mind moved lest I omit something.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">But that last paragraph, while probably the
    most important one, isn&rsquo;t the only thing I want to say now.
    First a little build-up: Right now I&rsquo;m a first-classman at the
    United States Naval Academy who has just finished exams but has not
    yet felt the drag of the last semester&rsquo;s academics. As such, I
    have an unusual and unfamiliar amount of blue and gold mixed with
    the rose-colored tint in my glasses, but I think there is really
    more to it than that and that is why I want to make the following
    request.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I would like to use your sword. Not because
    it belongs to my father, the proud naval officer who etc., etc., but
    not either because it belongs to my father the government worker who
    has a good family, a good home etc., etc.; not because it will ever
    be a family tradition or heirloom. You know as well as I that it
    will log in as much attic time with me as it has with you. (It was
    in fact stolen from George&rsquo;s room at Miramar after his crash!)
    I just want to use it because it belongs to my father, who in spite
    of what faults were his, gave me not a model to be emulated but an
    ideal to strive for in spite of my own faults. Well, that&rsquo;s
    the other important part, and that&rsquo;s all too. (Thanks son!)</p>
  <p class="western">As a matter of fact, that&rsquo;s not all. Not
    only are there nine other children yet to consider, it&rsquo;s not
    even all for George. We&rsquo;ll meet him again in this story.
    However, now it&rsquo;s Anne&rsquo;s turn. She is our only other
    child born outside of the greater metropolitan area of Washington,
    DC. Oh, she was born in Washington all right, but it was Washington
    State. As her expected arrival approached we were living in another
    summer cottage, this time on the banks of the Hood Canal at Sunset
    Beach, Union, Washington, near Bremerton and Seattle, and in the
    shadow of majestic Mount Hood. I had joined Kathleen and George
    there after Grandma and Grandpa Kirk had driven them there in our
    1936 Buick from our home on Santa Paula Way in Vallejo, California.
    However, our west coast family saga really should begin with mention
    of our 1931 Buick.</p>
  <p class="western">First, you must recall that in reviewing our
    family we have dispensed at this point with the chronological order
    of our overall story, which is on hold circa January 1945. This
    helps put the chronological age of our cars in better perspective.
    You will remember that I left PG school at the end of 1944 to join
    the light cruiser Amsterdam in Norfolk on 22 Jan 1945. We transited
    the Panama Canal in late Apr, shortly after we buried my father who
    had died of a heart attack on 12 Apr 1945, within an hour or two of
    FDR&rsquo;s death. On 8 May, V E Day, we crossed the international
    dateline as I was initiated into the order of the Golden Dragons. By
    early July I was fully involved in the Pacific war against Japan.</p>

    1931 Buick<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote39anc" href="#sdendnote39sym"><sup>39</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">Meanwhile, life on the home front went on. For
    about 2 months after my father&rsquo;s death in April of 1945,
    Kathleen and George lived with my mother in my parents&rsquo; home
    at 13th and Varnum streets, in northeast Washington. Then, sometime
    in the summer of 1945, Kathleen and George moved in to share a
    two-bedroom apartment with Aunt Louie and little Joe Woods located
    in Queenstown, Mt. Rainier, Md. Apartments were then very hard to
    get, but Kathleen and Louie had some kind of priority, since they
    were families of servicemen. (They didn&rsquo;t, however, have
    enough priority to get a telephone, which were then even more scarce
    than rental property.) They were there for about four or five
    months, when Joe Woods returned from the Pacific, at which point the
    Woods family relocated to North Carolina, and Kathleen and George
    settled in with the Kirks at 14th and Otis streets. They remained
    there until Dec of 1946, at which point George got to join in
    Kathleen&rsquo;s first cross country flying adventure, to join me
    for Christmas in Long Beach, California.</p>
  <p class="western">I had already procured a neat little house in a
    wartime housing project for servicemen, called Lexington Gardens.
    (Our backyard contained one of those ubiquitous southern California
    oil well pumps. We were almost afraid to let George dig in the
    yard.) I also secured our fabulous 1931 Buick, and believe me, cars
    were harder to come by than telephones. It had a high, straight-back
    (Model-A-Ford-like) profile, running boards, and a spare mounted on
    the back (which was so rust-frozen in place that we had to jack it
    off to fix a spare en route later from Bakersfield to Richmond,
    California &ndash; a trip on which we consumed 40 quarts of oil,
    which we actually ran out of and had to hike for once). It also had
    a fabric-coated roof to which I applied a full coat of paraffin wax
    to stop leaks. It had two redeeming graces: it didn&rsquo;t use much
    gas, and it always started. In fact, a neighbor with a relatively
    new car often had to borrow it for Sunday Mass when his plush
    convertible wouldn&rsquo;t start.</p>

    Jack with Geo, Lexington Park California</h3>
  <p class="western">Well, I was supposed to meet Kathleen and
    George&rsquo;s flight, and we were planning a happy Christmas
    reunion together while our ship underwent overhaul at Terminal
    Island Naval Shipyard (long since phased out, as the entire island
    was sinking several inches per year). We all forgot just one thing
    (Mary, please note!): we were part of the military establishment.
    Hence it happened that less than 24 hours before their flight was
    due, and while one-third of our crew had already been granted leave,
    our Terminal Island overhaul was shifted to Pearl Harbor! So it was
    that Kathleen and George were met by my shipmate, Assistant Engineer
    Officer Ace Foster, and his wife, Bernice. This is the same Ace
    Foster who would years later visit George in the Balboa Naval
    Hospital and then give us phoned reports of his condition. This is
    also the same couple which we diverted course to visit at Borrego
    Springs, Arizona, on our cross-country auto trip of 1979.</p>
  <p class="western">The Fosters met the plane in our Buick, and it
    seems Kathleen had visions of a much fancier car. Sorry, Kathleen!
    Anyhow when they arrived, George was starving, so the Fosters
    stopped at a roadside stand and George opted for a string of fresh
    bananas (something we hadn&rsquo;t had on the East coast for years
    because all ships were being used to carry war supplies). While he
    was feasting on monkey food, I was en route to Hawaii, suffering
    through a steady diet of Les Brown&rsquo;s Sentimental Journey (with
    Doris Day vocal) via the ship&rsquo;s PA system. I still get a lump
    in my throat and tears in my eyes at the sound of that tune. After
    all, this was the second family Christmas that military vagaries had
    devastated.</p>

    Lexington Park California (Long Beach)</h3>
  <p class="western">Life, and the war, went on, and while in the San
    Francisco area (of which Richmond is a Silver Spring&ndash;like
    northern suburb, on the Oakland side of the bay), we swapped the &rsquo;31
    for a &rsquo;36 Buick. Now, there was a car! It was long, low, and
    sleek, with chromium sheathed spares sunk in forward fender wells on
    both sides, and with full leg room and a pull-down,
    back-of-the-front-seat bar compartment in the rear. It would have
    done a bootlegger of the &rsquo;20s proud! It still ranks with our
    <a href="#corvairpic">Corvair</a> station wagon as my all-time
    favorite car. Once, commuting from our new quarters on Saipan Road
    (which is still on the map!) in Midway Village (at the foot of the
    San Bruno mountains in the Bayshore area) to our ship at the San
    Francisco Naval Shipyard (at Hunter&rsquo;s Point), it was smashed
    in the rear port quarter (well, actually it was smashed at 3rd and
    Army streets) by a truck, demolishing the fender and tire. We didn&rsquo;t
    have a jack. My fellow commuter, shipmate, and neighbor, Machinist
    Joe Botti, immediately fashioned a workable levering system from two
    wooden beams from the truck&rsquo;s load. Engineering magic!</p>

    1936 Buick<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote40anc" href="#sdendnote40sym"><sup>40</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">Later I was to renew the water pump on the car
    with a mechanical proficiency long since gone with the wind. I even
    personally remedied a transmission that wouldn&rsquo;t go into
    reverse. A garage had offered repairs at several hundred dollars. I
    removed the stick shift and top retaining plate and replaced a
    broken 35 cent detent spring. Again, engineering magic! (Many years
    later I learned that this should never be attempted except by a pro,
    as the slightest movement of the nipple to which the stick attaches,
    while the plate is removed, can bollix up the meshing of the gears
    forever! Luckily I didn&rsquo;t know that then, and so saved a
    couple hundred dollars!) Another thing we were to learn later, after
    Grandpa and Grandma Kirk had accompanied Kathleen and George on
    their relocation (in my absence) from Vallejo to Sunset Beach in the
    Seattle area, was that they had driven the whole 700-plus miles with
    a cracked rear axle &ndash; the ultimate consequence of the 3rd and
    Army street car crash! The repaired car finally went to a shipmate,
    Machinist Williams, when we returned east for the last time. That
    transaction earned us $25!</p>
  <p class="western">So it was that Anne, still lurking snugly within
    Kathleen, came to be pre-positioned in Washington State. Shortly
    before she was due to be born, my ship returned from the far Pacific
    for an overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. We really got the red
    carpet treatment. After all, I was returning to Bremerton,
    Washington, in the USS Bremerton (CA130)! We were all adopted sons
    of the city. But this son&rsquo;s wife was expecting a child, which
    turned out to be our first daughter. Well, it behooved us to move
    from rented quarters in the beautiful but remote boondocks, into
    government housing more within hailing distance of the Naval
    Hospital.</p>
  <p class="western">So it was that we spent all of Friday, 7 Mar
    1947, going back and forth between the two places, moving all our
    earthly possessions. We finally holed up at Sunset Beach that night,
    with only one trip to go the next morning to complete the job. We
    did finish up the job with a trip the next morning, but it was a
    hurry-up journey to the hospital, where Anne was born on a Saturday
    morning, attended by the same O.B., a Dr. Peterson, who had attended
    George in Annapolis some 2-and-1/2 years before! As usual,
    Kathleen&rsquo;s water broke early in the a.m., and we were off with
    a bang. I hurriedly threw some diapers (with which I had mopped up
    the bloody floor) into the bathtub as we departed with George, who I
    then had to take with me to the ship. Later the wife of the ship&rsquo;s
    Dr. Jacobs looked after George until we got Kathleen back home. (Dr.
    Jacobs was later killed in a tragic auto accident.)</p>
  <p class="western">George and I had breakfast in the wardroom, and
    he then accompanied me on my rounds of the engineering spaces, to
    the delight of all my snipes who enjoyed taking him off my hands and
    showing off for him. Chief Machinist Mate Maciolek dubbed him Chief
    Dugan (everything was Dugan this or Dugan that in those days, even
    as Mo was later to be dubbed Dugan Dog). Kathleen and I had lined up
    a live-in lady aid to assist on her first few days home alone, but
    we decided that we&rsquo;d rather be alone, so we canceled her. I
    took as much liberty as I could, leave being out of the question
    with all my machinery undergoing overhaul. The night before Kathleen
    returned home, my assistant, Lt. Ivan Rich (a mustang [&ldquo;mustang&rdquo;
    is an enlisted person who is promoted to the rank of Warrant
    Officer] like Ace Foster), came over for an evening&rsquo;s
    celebration during which we killed a bottle of bourbon (the Lamaze
    method of my day). Upon leaving, Ivan rammed the back of his car
    into a low retaining wall, stalling it, and it wouldn&rsquo;t
    restart. He had to taxi back to the ship. Next day we found where he
    had jarred the battery cable loose, an easy failure that I&rsquo;ve
    quickly spotted many times since. Live and learn. Which reminds me,
    never leave bloody messes in your bathtub. When I finally returned
    to Sunset Beach some days later, I was stunned by the stench and
    sight of crawling critters in the tub. Oh Wow! Yes, I remember
    Anne&rsquo;s birth.</p>
  <p class="western">Some twenty years later we got a succinct letter
    from Anne (6 Jun 1967) testifying to the value of the intervening
    years:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Mom and Dad, I have just reached a time in
    my life between the time I thought my parents were way off base and
    the time I realize too late (?) that they were right all along. I
    want to thank you for everything you&rsquo;ve done for me.</p>
  <p class="western">To be sure, we must have done lots of neat things
    for her, but I&rsquo;m not about to undertake a recital that might
    just provoke another mock comparison tirade from Martha like her &lsquo;I
    was the only one whose kindergarten picture Mom wouldn&rsquo;t buy.&rsquo;
    Anyhow, Anne&rsquo;s birthday was a Saturday, and you know what the
    anonymous rhyme says: Saturday&rsquo;s child has to work for a
    living! (Sorry about that George, Anne, Martha and Mary, but not to
    worry, Herbie!) Maybe as an aspiring lawyer, it might help Anne to
    know that Oliver Wendell Holmes had the same birthday. (It is
    likewise the birthday of dancer Cyd Charisse and actress Claire
    Trevor. It is also a holiday celebrated as International Woman&rsquo;s
    Day in the USSR.) I&rsquo;ll leave it to Anne to evaluate the
    ultimate cosmic significance of all these priceless data. Anyhow, it
    strikes me that Anne has always displayed the inquisitive mind so
    typical of lawyers penetrating to the ultimate reality of things.</p>
  <p class="western">Let me just cite three examples. Driving down
    16th Street one Sunday for a family afternoon at Hains Point
    (followed by a bag of 10 hamburgers for a dollar from the Little
    Tavern), we passed the Greek Orthodox church of Sts. Constantine and
    Helen. As was our custom whenever we passed our church, Anne sang
    out, Glory be to God! I unctuously intoned, that&rsquo;s not a
    Catholic church, honey. She immediately demolished me with this
    plaint, it&rsquo;s the same God, isn&rsquo;t it? Wow! Maybe I&rsquo;d
    better let one of Anne&rsquo;s letters (15 Feb 1978) tell another
    story:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">To give you an idea that things around here
    are not nearly as bleak as this letter may sound, the other day I
    was stuck behind some cars on a winding mountain road. My friend
    Sally was visiting from Washington and we drove together up into the
    mountains for a few days. I was explaining to her that when I was a
    kid we used to get stuck behind such slow drivers on the way to the
    bay beaches. I told her my father had called them darbs. Suddenly,
    at the ripe old age of 31 I knew that darb was an acronym. What an
    amazing discovery. All these years I thought we had an invented
    family nonsense word, and I realized it means Dumb Ass Road Block.
    It has to. Right? That is just too much of a coincidence not to be
    true. You adults smugly allowed your innocent kids to bandy about a
    semi-obscenity. Amazing! Doug couldn&rsquo;t believe it when I told
    him. Sally couldn&rsquo;t figure out why I thought it was so funny.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, what can I say? Strange to believe, I
    almost hate to confess that darb was just a nonsense word to me.
    Rather, it was part of a nonsense phrase, multi-colored darbs!
    Still, it&rsquo;s a great example of Anne&rsquo;s penetrating mind
    at work. And so to the final example of Anne&rsquo;s penetrating
    mind, this time in an introspective mode, with an excerpt from a
    letter of thanks following her Christmas homecoming in 1978:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">You have always treated all of your
    children with a sense of acceptance. Never using your love as a
    weapon to enforce our behavior to conform to your beliefs. Love is
    not conditional in your house. I have taken that so much for granted
    that I am still and always will be amazed to discover that this
    isn&rsquo;t so for most of the people I know. You have let us all
    know that during bad times you are there to offer support or advice
    when requested. I have recognized the wisdom of this approach when I
    saw it operate with Mary and Maureen, but to feel the glow of that
    acceptance myself is something I hadn&rsquo;t realized I wanted so
    much until I took it home with me on the plane to San Diego.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I wish I could express what it meant for me
    to come home at Christmas, after making such a radical change in my
    life, and know I wouldn&rsquo;t have to face any questions, make any
    excuses or even talk about any part of it unless I wanted to. This
    was a pretty bad year for me. I spent the entire time at home in
    Maryland soaking up the love and building up my strength like a
    recuperating patient just home from the war. Just sitting in your
    bedroom that one night and watching TV and not talking about
    anything in particular was such a comforting feeling.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Dressing in the dark on Christmas morning
    to go to early Mass, riding to Rockville with Mom to get the onion
    rye bread, sitting up late in the kitchen with Kate and drinking
    coffee, driving down the same old streets, seeing my brothers and
    sisters and their kids and friends&hellip; The night we arrived
    after everybody was in bed I went downstairs and just walked around
    touching things. You see it all again like new, and you are amazed
    to find that home is a beautiful place to come back to&hellip;
    Christmas healed the big hurt and unrest I had about being able to
    love again and to recognize and appreciate it when I saw it&hellip;
    And in a few hectic days, without ever really directly touching all
    that hurt, I felt at peace again. Now I am ready to look outside my
    own soul again. I have been living inside myself since June. It&rsquo;s
    good to see the sun shine again.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">It&rsquo;s no joke that I could return to
    my own home with such solace, so renewed and healed. Your passive
    support system saved my sanity if not my life. So aside from a thank
    you for the hospitality, the parties, the entertainment, the
    babysitting, etc., thanks also for that, for the unspoken,
    unspecified support and encouragement. Just because you didn&rsquo;t
    take me aside and pat my head (which would probably have been too
    painful just yet) doesn&rsquo;t mean that I didn&rsquo;t recognize
    and appreciate the love I felt. I have the neatest family, my
    brothers and sisters and my parents. Prolonged sigh. Deep breath.
    Thanks, family. I love you.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, that is quite a large testament, and I rest
    my case re Anne&rsquo;s penetrating mind. The truth is, however, I
    could add so much more about each and every one of our children, but
    you have to remember that ostensibly this is an autobiography. Hence
    I must try to limit progeny prose to that which reveals child-parent
    relationships and interaction. This isn&rsquo;t easy, so please
    don&rsquo;t be too critical.</p>
  <p class="western">Recall, as well, that I can only work with the
    written testaments actually available to me. In this connection (and
    thereby passing over Charlie for the moment), Martha remains a
    fascinating enigma. Alone and distinct from all of our children, I
    believe, she has always been uniquely independent, a very tightly
    held private person. One is almost tempted to ask, Will the real
    Martha Wright Toth please stand up! This is particularly interesting
    when you consider that she has, unlike any of her siblings, spent
    all of her married life (13 years as I write) well removed from the
    area of the parental domicile. We&rsquo;ve gotten many a long letter
    from Utah, the Philippines, Alabama, Detroit and Florida. All are
    most revelatory of Martha herself, but you&rsquo;ll find nary a clue
    as to feelings or reaction <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Mom and Dad.</p>
  <p class="western">Martha has always seemed serenely
    self-sufficient. This is not to suggest that she is cold or even
    indifferent, it&rsquo;s just that her quiet self-assurance has
    (wittingly or otherwise) served as a sort of shield against personal
    disclosure. It&rsquo;s perhaps significant that even George (in his
    letter congratulating her on her high school scholarship) remarked
    on Martha&rsquo;s low-key temperament, thus: &ldquo;You are an
    outstandingly intelligent kid. Now don&rsquo;t go getting a swelled
    head. (One of your best qualities is that you are quiet, you can
    keep to yourself).&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">One might be easily tempted to conjecture that
    perhaps the reason for Martha&rsquo;s detachment stems from the fact
    that she shall always remain our very first child of the TV age! In
    fact (and this, too, may be more revelatory of me than even I
    suspect), my sole recollection of Martha&rsquo;s birth is that I
    stopped in the Woodmoor Shopping Center on the way from greeting
    Martha&rsquo;s arrival at the hospital and bought our very first TV
    set, a 12&quot; table model Westinghouse. It was black and white, of
    course. So, we might fantasize that Martha passed the formative
    first six years of her life propped up in front of the TV set,
    rather than luxuriating in the minute-by-minute doting of fully
    attentive parents. TV does breed a certain detachment, even among a
    tight little community of watchers.</p>
  <p class="western">In any event, Martha was in fact born on 29 Jul
    1950. Like George and Anne before her, and Mary and Herbie after
    her, she was born on a Saturday. For some strange reason, we had no
    child born on a Thursday or Friday, so (according to the poem) none
    of our children have far to go or are loving and giving. (Well, the
    second part of that prophecy is certainly suspect!) Martha is our
    only child whose birthday is also her feast day, since 29 July is
    also the feast of St. Martha. It is also the anniversary date of
    Drake&rsquo;s defeat of the Spanish Armada (1588), the birth of
    Mussolini (1883), the birth of UN Secretary General Dag
    Hammarskjold, and authors Booth Tarkington and Alexis de
    Tocqueville. Martha, clearly, remains the outstanding event of 29
    Jul even though spawned in the community detachment and general
    amnesia heralded by the coincident advent of the so-called golden
    age of TV.</p>
  <p class="western">But, like the lady in Hamlet, perhaps I, too,
    protest too much. After all, we do know how Martha feels about her
    folks. Even her latest letter (Jan 1984 as I write) speaks volumes
    regarding our interaction. It may not always be explicit, but a
    wealth of heart-warming information may be safely inferred. Thus,
    out of a total of 5-1/2 pages, fully 3-1/2 pages are a paean to her
    children, her husband, and to old-fashioned, stay-at-home
    motherhood. Her very lifestyle is the highest sort of endorsement
    for our example, as is her adherence to the one-man-in-your-life
    principle. We could hardly ask for more, but there is more. &ldquo;We
    all <i>really</i> (her emphasis!) enjoy your visits, which are
    getting to be a nice Fourth of July tradition. As long as you can
    stand the trip, please do come!&rdquo; Then she concludes: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    almost as sad for Mary (re her recent separation) as I am happy for
    KT (in her pregnancy). KT is in one of the most naturally happy
    periods of life I can imagine. And I suppose Mary must be just as
    down. Damn it! They&rsquo;re supposed to live happily ever after! I
    suppose you feel it even more than I. Well, if it&rsquo;s any
    consolation <i>I am</i> (Martha&rsquo;s emphasis) living happily
    ever after. You can scratch at least one kid from your worry list.&rdquo;
    (Where did I ever get the idea that we didn&rsquo;t know how Martha
    felt about us?)</p>
  <p class="western">Now, you&rsquo;ll recall that we momentarily
    skipped Charles. That is really symbolic. It has almost Freudian
    significance. We&rsquo;ve always skipped Charlie! That&rsquo;s just
    the way it is with children who have the misfortune to be born
    within 3 days of Christmas! Little wonder that he registered a
    protest against the Wrights by being our first left-hander. He was
    entitled, but he certainly has never demonstrated it, if ever he
    carried any grudge. In fact, I&rsquo;d have to say Charlie is our
    foremost representative of stability. It&rsquo;s so appropriate that
    he sprang up in the age of Mad magazine and the &lsquo;What, me
    worry?&rsquo; kid. If he had been born in the days of kings he might
    well have been labeled Charlie, the Unflappable. Ralph Waldo Emerson
    must have had Charlie for his prototype when he coined the famous
    phrase, Stay cool! This isn&rsquo;t to say that he doesn&rsquo;t
    have a helluva temper, but this is my story, so let&rsquo;s leave
    his mother&rsquo;s influence out of this. Well, we can&rsquo;t very
    well do that, can we, and with Charlie, least of all. Both Maureen
    and Herbie had traumatic births. Herbie died within 3 hours, and a
    birth can hardly have a more traumatic result than that. And, even
    though Maureen came 2 months early (weighing in at 3-and-1/2
    pounds), there was little doubt that she hadn&rsquo;t come to stay.</p>
  <p class="western">It was different with Charlie. His arrival kept
    us all on pins and needles all the way. More than that, his
    touch-and-go arrival was another of those events in my life (the
    death of my father was the first) to evoke a trance-like mode in
    which one experiences a dream-world suspension of time and reality.
    The best simile for trying to explicate this condition that comes to
    mind is that, if life is indeed a story, then this event was like
    when the author lays the pen down and goes to lunch, and the
    characters are then on hold until he returns. For several hours on
    the afternoon and evening on which Charlie was being born, the
    Author of Life was out on a long lunch indeed. We waited with bated
    breath for Him to return and pick up the thread of the action. (As
    an aside, this mode returned on the news of George&rsquo;s crash,
    and upon my awakening in the intensive care unit following heart
    surgery. It&rsquo;s a truly magic time. I expect the hour of death
    will be similar.) I can&rsquo;t remember the exact details of the
    problem, but I sure can remember the nature of it.</p>
  <p class="western">It all came down to this. A somber Dr. Holden
    approached me late in the evening, in the appropriately threatening
    gloom of twilight. He indicated that the situation had developed
    into the classic question of whether Charlie or Kathleen would make
    it, and Dr. Holden sought my input on the matter. I was so spaced
    out that I addressed him as a priest. Are you a Catholic, Father? I
    asked. Yes, he replied simply. Do you know what the Church teaches
    regarding such situations? I asked. Again, a simple, Yes. Then, I
    said, Proceed according to the Church&rsquo;s teaching. My receding
    memory still projects a picture of relief on his face, as though I
    may have relieved some unspoken burden. I myself can confess to a
    surging serenity. The matter had safely been placed in the hands of
    the Author of Life. I was no longer worried about the outcome.</p>
  <p class="western">A search of the archives reveals that Charlie has
    also been an author, the case in point being a Father&rsquo;s Day
    note presented to me in Jun of 1983. Thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">For so many years I&rsquo;ve been wanting
    to somehow let you know how you have affected my life. You worked
    for so many years, you and Mom, trying to raise nine of us the best
    way you knew how. Many times trying to teach us how to live, and
    many times teaching by example without realizing it. Over the years,
    as you watched us all grow up, it must have been so difficult to
    watch us make our own individual mistakes. Must have been so hard
    when things seemed to be going exactly against your hopes and
    prayers. Well, it didn&rsquo;t all go bad. The really good things
    are quiet things like a love for your parents and a desire to have a
    family as happy and as optimistic as the one you and Mom made for
    us. Over the years you wonder whether the effort you put out was
    worth it &hellip; wonder if anyone ever heard any of the things you
    said. Well, I did and I know I&rsquo;m NOT alone. We have lots of
    parties in our family but I find that for my part, I rarely talk
    about things like love. I suppose one trait I share with you is my
    difficulty in talking feelings. But, again like you, I can write
    them. So I&rsquo;m taking this opportunity this Father&rsquo;s Day
    to let you know that I love you. I&rsquo;m taking this opportunity
    to say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; for all the years of being my Dad.
    Thank you for all those things which just can&rsquo;t be described
    like my values, my attitude in life like&hellip; I truly hope that I
    am able to be for my kids as good a Dad as you have been for me.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, I can&rsquo;t possibly top that! A letter
    like that is quite a present indeed, and I guess that&rsquo;s the
    best way to look at Charlie himself. He was and remains a present &ndash;
    a Christmas present to our whole family. Some people may remember 22
    Dec as the birthday of famed Italian composer, Giacomo Puccini.
    Others might celebrate it as Ladybird Johnson&rsquo;s birthday. That
    date is also remembered as the day they opened the Lincoln Tunnel in
    New York City (1937), the day Wake Island fell to the Japs in WWII
    (1941), or the day General McAuliffe told the Germans &ldquo;Nuts!&rdquo;
    (1944). In fact, if you wish, you may celebrate 22 Dec as the feast
    day of Mother Cabrini. Actually, I&rsquo;m afraid, we&rsquo;ll all
    mostly continue to think of it as &ldquo;only three more shopping
    days &rsquo;til Christmas!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s really too bad. Let&rsquo;s
    hope that the foregoing crazy recital of trivia will help us all to
    remember that Charlie was born on a Wednesday that was 22 Dec 1948,
    and that he&rsquo;ll never be forgotten again in the Christmas rush.
    I&rsquo;ll never forget him! Being our only child born between Navy
    benefits and Blue Cross coverage, he&rsquo;s our only child that was
    bought and paid for!</p>
  <p class="western">And so we come to John-Boy. He was a Sunday
    arrival, just like Kathleen and I, and our only child to be born on
    that day. So, as the poem promises, we can expect him to be &ldquo;fair
    and wise and good, but (Thank God) he&rsquo;s not &ldquo;gay&rdquo;!
    John&rsquo;s birthday, the 24th of Aug, is also the feast day of St.
    Bartholomew the forgotten apostle. (His name is found on the list of
    the apostles but he&rsquo;s mentioned nowhere else in the entire New
    Testament.) John is hardly likely to ever become a forgotten man,
    however, as he is more in the image of his patron saint, St. John
    Vianney (4 Aug), one of the best known modern saints, a.k.a. the
    Cure of Ars. John enjoyed a rather unremarkable birth, which is
    highly appropriate, since he&rsquo;s been so remarkable ever since.
    (For example, how many of his siblings can claim to have pole
    vaulted over 15 feet?) Kathleen&rsquo;s only recollection anent the
    advent of John into this vale of tears is that, &ldquo;He seemed to
    be telling a joke as he came on the scene, but as usual I didn&rsquo;t
    get the point.&rdquo; So it goes, and John has been the family joker
    ever since.</p>
  <p class="western">JJ hasn&rsquo;t always had a lot to joke about,
    however, and his encounter with rocks and shoals in the sea of
    matrimony evoked some very serious moments. In fact, John probably
    didn&rsquo;t get all the support that he needed early on when his
    matrimonial ship went aground. He remains, even under the most
    trying circumstances, such a bon vivant, such a great pretender,
    that it is difficult to believe that his outwardly cheerful
    disposition might only be skin deep at times. He kids about
    everything so much that it is too often impossible to take him
    seriously. So, let the word go forth, here and now: we realize,
    John, that you often hid a bleeding heart behind a widely grinning
    face, and we sure admire your fortitude, and we do love you, so we
    also often bled silently with you! The same goes in this respect for
    Anne and Mary.</p>
  <p class="western">John, of course, always knew that. As with the
    other progeny reviewed thus far, Johnny is also &ldquo;on the
    record.&rdquo; An undated letter, circa 24 May 1983, comes to hand.
    With characteristic ruffles and flourishes John establishes the date
    only as: &ldquo;Sunday night, about 8:15 pm, the calm of dusk.&rdquo;
    That&rsquo;s John! Everything he does, he does with style. As Flip
    Wilson might put it, John is swave (suave). So it is that he also
    closed the referenced letter with typical style, thus: &ldquo;With
    true love, from your youngest living son.&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s nice to
    note his remembrance of Herbie, even in the very midst of his own
    traumatic tribulations. Way to go, John!) But it&rsquo;s time to let
    John himself testify to our relationship. (That&rsquo;s what these
    kiddy-capsules are all about remember!?! &ndash; an attempt to
    portray, however briefly, the interaction of parents and progeny.)
    So, speak, John!</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Your letter of last week re my personal
    crosses was very comforting and well received. I respond now mainly
    because it&rsquo;s very important to me that I&rsquo;ve <i>never</i>
    [the emphasis is John&rsquo;s] had the slightest doubts about your
    love, concern, and willingness to help me or anyone else in the
    family for that matter. I do understand your commitment to never
    &ldquo;fail to speak up&rdquo; again. I too carry certain regrets
    about my de facto seeming indifference to other family concerns such
    as Mary&rsquo;s teenage problem. So, where am I now? Wounded, yes!
    But not mortally so. The trauma has helped me to grow. In spite of
    the pain of transition, I&rsquo;m not blind to the fact that I still
    am so very well off. I&rsquo;ve so much to be thankful for that
    self-pity rarely lingers long. Number one on my list of good
    fortunes are parents who care.</p>
  <p class="western">John reminds me of my father. Neither wrote
    often, but when they did write they managed to say it all! And,
    curse that it may be, I suspect that John might well also be the son
    most like me, which is kind of appropriate since we both share the
    same first name. Anyhow, like me, he can only get serious via a
    letter. In person we both are prone to parry every overture to
    serious conversation with a joke. A letter from KT (19 Dec 1977) is
    relevant:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Mom has always been so easy to love. I
    think nothing of telling her I love her. We&rsquo;d always go up and
    hug and kiss her. That&rsquo;s Mom, she&rsquo;s very affectionate.
    And that was (and still is) nice. But you [your author] were
    different. You weren&rsquo;t as verbal with your thoughts. You
    tended to joke around rather than come right out and say to me, &ldquo;KT,
    I love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">That&rsquo;s me, all right, and, I believe,
    that&rsquo;s John, too! We strive mightily to hide our real feelings
    behind a mask of devil-may-care levity. There&rsquo;s probably a
    very good reason for this. Personally, I attribute it to a keen
    sense of vulnerability. I dare not risk letting anyone peek too
    deeply into the secret garden of my soul, since I live in constant
    fear that they might trample the fragile flowers they&rsquo;d find
    there. I never could stand ridicule. Outright physical pain was, for
    me, much to be preferred. I don&rsquo;t know why this is so. Surely,
    it&rsquo;s pride, but whence such tremendous pride? Again, in my
    case, I suspect that it&rsquo;s a direct hangover from my mother&rsquo;s
    all-consuming inferiority complex. Perhaps I passed these genes on
    to John. Sorry about that!</p>
  <p class="western">But there remains this further similarity between
    John and me. Even as my birth occurred on the anniversary of the
    advent of the world&rsquo;s biggest gun ever &ndash; the Germans&rsquo;
    WWI &ldquo;Big Bertha,&rdquo; John&rsquo;s birth is also marked by
    the anniversary of a singular super-event: it marked the day the
    British burned our nation&rsquo;s capital city to the ground in
    1814. Both of our birthdays were days historically signaled by
    outstanding fireworks displays. John will no doubt agree with me
    this is simply as it should be.</p>
  <p class="western">And then came the 6th little Indian, Mary. I&rsquo;ve
    been good-naturedly accused of regarding her as my favorite child, a
    self-contradiction if ever there was one. Still, I&rsquo;ll admit to
    the charge to the extent that a slightly special relationship was
    experienced on my part, stemming from my belief that she was our
    only child whose features favored me more than my devoted spouse.
    Mary&rsquo;s arrival in this world was also &ldquo;slightly
    special.&rdquo; There were no big fireworks that I can recall, but
    she did arrive on the day, 20 Feb, that was to become the
    anniversary (in 1962) of John Glenn&rsquo;s pioneering American
    earth orbiting. (Hers is also the birthday of Gloria Vanderbilt,
    Sidney Poitier, Sandy Duncan, Patty Hearst Shaw, and the late
    Premier Kosygin.) Like George, Anne, and Martha before her, and
    Herbie after her, Mary was born on a Saturday morning, precisely at
    11:40 am. What made her arrival &ldquo;slightly special&rdquo; was
    that Mary remains our only child whose birth was induced. It seems
    that she and Kathleen had gone full term, and Mary was reluctant to
    come forth. How characteristic of Mary. She never did become a
    joiner, and she even started life by hesitating to join the human
    race. As the German soldier used to say on Laugh In, &ldquo;Vee-rry
    in-tuh-rres-ting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">The fact might well have been, of course, that
    Mary was struggling all the while to be born. She certainly has been
    struggling since. For sure, she is one Saturday&rsquo;s child who
    has had to &ldquo;work for a living&rdquo;! And the entire family is
    mighty proud of her. Of course, here once again I must confess to a
    slightly special warmth. Mary is, after all, the only daughter to
    opt for a stint in our military service. I have to admire that, but
    not because I&rsquo;m a hawk or gung-ho military fanatic. If you&rsquo;ve
    read thus far, then you&rsquo;re already familiar with my residual
    evaluation of the services. No, I admire this course on her part
    precisely because I&rsquo;m so intimately aware of the tremendous
    sacrifices it entails. In this perspective, to my mind at least,
    Mary has exhibited uncommon character and courage. &ldquo;Well Done,
    Mary!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">You may now well ask but what about Mary? How
    does she feel? You may not believe this, but, yes, we have yet
    another letter to introduce into evidence. Let&rsquo;s let Mary
    speak for herself (24 Apr 1981):</p>
  <p class="quote-western">This letter should have been written many
    years ago, but in truth, you don&rsquo;t appreciate what you have
    until it&rsquo;s gone. In this case, until I was gone. The reality
    of what I have done has finally sunk in and it&rsquo;s really shaken
    me. In Texas I had no time to think about anything or anybody, until
    the last 2&ndash;3 weeks. Then I was really homesick. I&rsquo;m not
    so busy here in Denver, and the enormity of what I&rsquo;ve done has
    finally hit me.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I never realized what home meant until I
    visited these alien parts. The sight of a green tree or a blooming
    azalea brings tears to my eyes now. How good to be back home at
    Easter; how bitter to have to leave again. The knowledge is that
    much more bitter when I realize that my life, from now on, will be a
    series of partings. A poet once wrote, &ldquo;Parting is all we know
    of heaven, and all we need of hell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I feel I must take time now to square old
    accounts. How long has it been since I told you both how much I love
    you? Have I ever thanked you for loving me? I feel like I&rsquo;ve
    redeemed myself now for past mistakes, by doing some difficult and
    challenging things. I&rsquo;ve certainly proved a thing or two to
    myself. But I never could have accomplished anything without your
    love and support. Since Laurie was born and I crossed over into the
    realm of parenthood, many things became clear to me. But I&rsquo;ve
    always had difficulty talking to the people I love. You know, Dad,
    I&rsquo;m my father&rsquo;s child. (Now, how can I resist that!?!)
    So everyone came to San Antonio, and I was touched beyond words. God
    what a handicap to be unable to put feelings into words. I wanted to
    hold each of my brothers and sisters close to me, and I wanted to
    really talk to them about themselves.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Yet somehow I seem to miss connections
    verbally. I look at my family, and my siblings are good people,
    every one of them. How proud it must make you feel to look at your
    children, and you have every reason to be proud. Yet at the same
    time I know how your hearts must be breaking over Anne and John.
    (And later, of course, over Mary herself.) What parent doesn&rsquo;t
    want to spare his children pain? It&rsquo;s one of the curses of
    parenthood that you must let each child live and learn; for their
    own sake you cannot and must not shield them from life&rsquo;s
    unhappiness. They have to grow up on their own. All we can really do
    is try to provide guidance.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">So here we are. This letter is to thank you
    for the guidance you provide me, and the more important guidance you
    provide Laurie. I don&rsquo;t have to tell you that she is more
    precious to me than life itself. You are parents, so you&rsquo;ll
    understand that. Thank you for Texas. Thank you for loving me. Thank
    you for everything. I hope I&rsquo;ve made you proud of me.</p>
  <p class="western">You say, &ldquo;But we still don&rsquo;t know how
    Mary <i>really</i> feels about her parents!&rdquo; Oh ye of little
    faith! I guess we had best include at this point a postscript from
    Mary&rsquo;s letter to Kathleen on her 65th birthday (6 Jan 1983):</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Happy Birthday, Mother! I don&rsquo;t know
    that I ever thanked you for all that you&rsquo;ve done for me.
    Sometimes it takes a long time for children to truly appreciate
    their parents. I&rsquo;m reminded of the climactic scene between
    Sidney Poitier and his father in Guess Who&rsquo;s Coming to Dinner?
    The one where he screams at his father that as a parent he owed his
    child everything, because he voluntarily accepted the
    responsibilities of parenthood, while Sidney (on the other hand)
    owed his father nothing. I suppose that&rsquo;s technically correct,
    but morally it&rsquo;s pretty hard to swallow.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">So here goes. Thank you for never yelling
    at me when I wet the bed until I was 10 or 12. Thank you for taking
    care of me when I was sick. Thank you for teaching me to sew. For
    setting a good example. For acting as the peacemaker. For always
    doing your best and encouraging us to do likewise. For having a
    happy marriage. For giving me the religious education that came to
    mean so much when I grew up. For loving me no matter what I did. For
    always standing by me. For being a mother to Laurie when I was at
    work, and gone in the Air Force. For teaching me right from wrong,
    and showing how strong love can be. Thank you for being my mother.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Always know that I love you, and Dad too,
    and I&rsquo;m thankful for everything you&rsquo;ve done for me. All
    I am today is because of you. I pray for you both every day, and I
    wish I could be near you. I guess in my heart I&rsquo;m always with
    you.</p>
  <p class="western">And so, at last, the spirit of our Air Force
    representative zooms off into the wild blue yonder, leaving us to
    focus on Maureen. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; I hear someone scream.
    Shouldn&rsquo;t it be KT? Tough bunny cakes! Here&rsquo;s the deal.
    I went through WWII and a total of 38 years of government service
    with the name W&#8209;R&#8209;I&#8209;G&#8209;H&#8209;T. This means
    I spent a lot of time standing in a lot of lines, <i>always</i> at
    the end. And now here&rsquo;s Maureen. As long as she lives she will
    <i>always</i> be our youngest living child. She&rsquo;ll <i>always</i>
    bring up the rear. Well, Mo, I can sympathize with that. So, let
    this record speak for itself. This is<i> one time Mo doesn&rsquo;t
      come in last</i>. Okay, everybody? This is appropriate in another
    way: Mo almost didn&rsquo;t come in at all! She arrived on 3 Aug
    1959, even as her godfather-to-be (Gene Sheehan) and I sat across
    the street from Columbia Hospital in Melona&rsquo;s Bar and Grill
    sipping martinis. (Gene&rsquo;s wife gave birth to a daughter almost
    simultaneously with Maureen&rsquo;s birth. I think her name became
    Eileen. Hope you two meet someday, Mo. It might be interesting.) Mo,
    of course, is our only child born on a Monday. Thus she is
    undoubtedly &ldquo;fair of face&rdquo;! (So, why did we dub her
    &ldquo;Dugan Dog&rdquo;?<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote41anc" href="#sdendnote41sym"><sup>41</sup></a>)
    [A hangover from the Chief Machinist Mate who dubbed toddler George
    Chief Dugan when &ldquo;everything was Dugan this or Dugan that in
    those days&rdquo;?]</p>
  <p class="western">In all events, Mo came early for the party. Being
    only 7 months into term, she weighed in at a mere 3-and-1/2 pounds!
    She knew how to get a head start on a trim figure. Of course, she
    immediately went into an incubator, complete with respiratory
    apparatus. It being 3 Aug and beyond, we came to liken her private,
    climate-controlled cubicle to an apartment on the Riviera, and I&rsquo;d
    drop by for a brief visit with her every day on my way from work to
    home (which wasn&rsquo;t to be air-conditioned for another six
    years). Once there, everyone would greet me eagerly with the double
    query: &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Maureen? When&rsquo;s she coming home?&rdquo;
    And I&rsquo;d make my routine reply, beginning with the immortal
    words of Jackie Gleason, &ldquo;She was just lying there. She wasn&rsquo;t
    doing nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo; And, &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t say,
    yet, when she can come home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">This was all really a very new and strange
    business for us as well as for Mo. Kathleen&rsquo;s return home with
    new babe in arms was now a well-established tradition. Usually I&rsquo;d
    carry the baby in, and place it in the arms of the senior kid
    present, and then I&rsquo;d return to the car and carry Kathleen in,
    because she was to avoid all steps for a week or so. Then all
    present would sit on the couch, and the children would take turns
    holding the baby while I&rsquo;d snap pictures for the family
    archives. This time no baby accompanied Kathleen&rsquo;s homecoming,
    and the whole business seemed a little weird, as though we were
    missing the main character in the whole play. I think we all felt
    just a little cheated. As near as we could tell, Mo didn&rsquo;t
    seem to mind. She just lay there like a lump &ldquo;on the Riviera.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">It was something like 4-to-6 weeks later that Mo
    was finally welcomed home. As I recall, Kathleen and I drove down to
    get her, and then Kathleen stayed in the car while I lugged the
    little lump out of the hospital. From thereon, we acted out our
    usual homecoming tableau &ndash; it was all just a month or so late.
    Our little family was all together again. Of course, we didn&rsquo;t
    realize it then, but this was to be the final performance of this
    wonderful little scenario. Herbie never made it to his earthly home,
    opting instead to go directly to his eternal home. And Herbie
    ventured into the world via the Caesarian route, a fact which
    (together no doubt with a consideration of Kathleen&rsquo;s age)
    prompted our good Dr. Holden (who delivered everyone from Charlie to
    Herbie) to say, &ldquo;No more.&rdquo; Forthwith we were forced to
    confront birth control, or rather birth avoidance, for the first
    time. We used the temperature charting method of determining periods
    of &ldquo;safe&rdquo; sexual activity from then on through
    Kathleen&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;change of life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">But let&rsquo;s get back to Mo&rsquo;s &ldquo;change
    of life,&rdquo; her descent from the Riviera to our humble if hot
    little home. It&rsquo;s really unfortunate that we don&rsquo;t have
    the precise date for this homecoming. Earlier I merely speculated
    that Mo had remained &ldquo;on the Riviera&rdquo; for perhaps 4-to-6
    weeks. Upon analyzing the records which we do have, I now can
    confirm this more positively. A review of the baptismal records of
    John, Mary, Katie, and Monica disclosed that they were baptized
    respectively 7, 8, 11, and 12 days after their births. This suggests
    they were uniformly baptized the first Sunday following their return
    home about 3 days after birth. Maureen, on the other hand, was
    baptized <i>41 days after her birth.</i> This strongly suggests that
    Mo may well have spent on the order of 29 days in the hospital.</p>
  <p class="western">I also have a lingering memory of getting pretty
    tired of having to divert and delay my trip homeward, suggesting
    that this practice went on for quite a while. I have a similar
    lingering memory of the growing exasperation of family members at
    the nightly announcement that there was still no word on when Mo
    would be released. It could be that Mo had an inkling of the good
    deal she was enjoying and wasn&rsquo;t too excited about giving up
    her position as Queen Bee to become the last in a line of nine
    living offspring.</p>
  <p class="western">In any event, there&rsquo;s no question about
    Mo&rsquo;s 3 Aug birth. Her advent into the world shares billing
    with such other illustrious events occurring on 3 Aug as Columbus&rsquo;
    departure to discover the so-called New World, and the Jules
    Verne&ndash;like atomic submarine Nautilus traversing under the
    North Pole. Yes, folks! Mo&rsquo;s birth ranks right up there with
    these historic events. Singer Tony Bennett also belted out his very
    first song on 3 August (1926), and Mary may well turn pea-green with
    envy to learn that Mo, rather than herself, shares her birthday with
    the redoubtable Dolores del Rio! Naturally the question arises, &ldquo;Has
    all this celebrity turned Mo&rsquo;s pretty little head?&rdquo;
    Hardly. She may be frugal with her words, but she&rsquo;s always to
    the point. Thus, on Christmas 1975 she wrote:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I really do appreciate all the things you
    (Mom and Dad) have done for me. I know I&rsquo;m a spoiled brat, and
    I hope to get over it (which, if ever it was true, she surely long
    since has). No matter whether I&rsquo;m the biggest brat in the
    world or the shyest little girl in town, I will love you always.</p>
  <p class="western">Again, on the occasion of my near complete heart
    failure in November of 1979, Mo wrote:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">It&rsquo;s sad that someone has to get sick
    before you realize how much you really care for them, but I&rsquo;m
    guilty and I&rsquo;m sorry. I know you know I love you very much,
    but I had to say it again.</p>
  <p class="western">Now, that&rsquo;s truly a ton of love from a
    former 3-and-1/2 pounder, and on that happy note we&rsquo;d best
    move on. I guess our review might as well proceed in reverse order,
    back up the list, and so we now turn the spotlight on Monica. She is
    our only Tuesday&rsquo;s child, and so the poem goes, she must be
    &ldquo;full of grace.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s also fair of face, and
    often reminds me of comely Shirley MacLaine. Her Birthday, 28 May,
    is also Puerto Rico&rsquo;s Independence Day, and the anniversary of
    the Charleston, South Carolina, earthquake of 1866, which remains
    the biggest earthquake <i>ever</i>, east of the Mississippi. She
    also shares her birthday with William Pitt, St. Thomas More, and the
    Dionne quintuplets (1934). Monica became our first child born from
    our Kinross Avenue home. I guess this really proves that eight is
    enough when it comes to 3-bedroom homes like the one we left on
    Dallas Avenue.</p>
  <p class="western">I must say I&rsquo;ll never forget the night of 3
    Aug 1957. I had just switched jobs in the Navy Department, joining
    the Navy Management Office on the Easter Monday of 21 Apr 1957. The
    guy who had opened the door for that promotion was a fellow I had
    formerly worked with in the Bureau of Ships, Jack Smith (whose son
    Jim was later briefly to live in the apartment above Katie and Greg
    in Hyattsville). It was only natural, therefore, that Jack came over
    to Kinross Avenue that evening to help me celebrate. We drank
    everything we had in the house &ndash; not a lot of anything,
    really, just a little of this and a little of that. I still remember
    that it finally came down to where all we had left was some vermouth
    available simply for making martinis with long-gone gin. So we ended
    up drinking straight vermouth. What with all the other junk that had
    preceded it, we both ended up &ndash; not drunk, there hadn&rsquo;t
    been enough of anything &ndash; but sick as dogs. This, then, was
    the only time I might have been said to have had labor pains of my
    own.</p>
  <p class="western">I wonder what Monica might have thought of all
    this! Luckily, she wasn&rsquo;t home yet. And even when she came
    home, and all the while she was there, she never really said very
    much. But she definitely had a mind of her own. For example: when
    she was barely 5 years old we discovered her left eye was not
    focusing properly, so the doctor said she must wear a patch over the
    right eye to force the lazy left eye to work more. Well, Moni didn&rsquo;t
    care for this at all, but she dutifully put the patch on every
    morning, only to discard it on the way to school! This was
    discovered by the other children who found the discarded patches
    littering the route to school. And from then on she wore glasses.
    You might say, Monica just couldn&rsquo;t <i>see</i> eye-patches (I
    certainly won&rsquo;t).</p>
  <p class="western">Monica could sure see the value of letter
    writing, however, especially when you wanted to really pour out what
    was in your heart. We found this out shortly after she left home for
    what turned out to be forever. She had just moved into a little
    house all by herself in Tallahassee to complete her master&rsquo;s
    degree at Florida State University. Thus, she wrote on 3 Sep 1975:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">You&rsquo;ll never know how thankful I am.
    You might wonder thankful about what or whom? I&rsquo;m thankful my
    utmost for you two. I&rsquo;m thankful to you two for everything
    you&rsquo;ve given me (and are still giving me), but more important
    everything you&rsquo;ve made me. Dad, you&rsquo;ve said how you and
    Mom weren&rsquo;t perfect (and your author is so glad that here Moni
    put that statement in the past tense), but you&rsquo;ll never be
    able to realize what perfect examples you&rsquo;ve been to me, or, I
    should say to us, because I&rsquo;m sure the rest of the family
    would agree. I, too (like you&rsquo;ve said about your father, Dad),
    have an apprehension about being able to live up to two such
    wonderful examples. It&rsquo;s not only me who admires you, but when
    I was talking to Mrs. Blakely, before I left, she too mentioned how
    the neighbors hold you two in great respect. This is something I&rsquo;ve
    always wanted to be able to say face-to-face, but I (like you, Mom)
    get too emotional. Being away gives me a chance to see how much you
    (Mom and Dad) and everyone else really mean to me. It gives me a
    medium (letters!) through which I can finally communicate what I&rsquo;ve
    felt all along. I love you! (Thanks, Monica! We love you, too.)</p>
  <p class="western">So at last we come to KT. It&rsquo;s ironically
    appropriate that she should be reviewed last, since she was the one
    to suggest this project in the first place. KT is also,
    incidentally, the last child to be born in our first family home on
    Dallas Avenue. It&rsquo;s rather remarkable, I think, that all of
    our children grew up in one or both of our two family homes,
    situated within a short two blocks of each other, and that all of
    them completed their entire elementary education in the same school,
    St. Bernadette&rsquo;s. I expect such stability is a very rare
    experience among their peer group. But, this is the way it was.</p>
  <p class="western">KT shares her birthday with Arthur Godfrey,
    Frederick March, and famous educator Maria Montessori. Her birthday
    also marks the anniversary of the start of Lewis and Clark&rsquo;s
    trek to the northwest, and the date Thomas Edison patented the
    modern motion picture projector. (No doubt these little forays into
    historical trivia have amused my progeny, but I think all will agree
    that stooping to such detail not only is revelatory of the author&rsquo;s
    penchant for detail, but it lends a certain uniqueness to each one&rsquo;s
    birthday. Anyhow, I herewith promise no further such digressions. Of
    course there will be other kinds of digressions!) KT left a rather
    large literary legacy as a byproduct of her foray into the far west
    to find her fortune in 1977 at age 22. (How&rsquo;s that for a
    double dose of alliteration, folks?) Rather than persisting in
    proliferating my own painful prose, perhaps it would be preferable
    to yield to KT&rsquo;s complimentary compositions, thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">These are just a few thoughts on Father&rsquo;s
    Day (Jun 1977) to let you know what you mean to me. I&rsquo;ve come
    to know you better during these past few years. You try strive to be
    the best person you possibly can be and this shows. The neatest and
    most important thing about you is that you welcome change. Too many
    people, of all ages, stop growing, stop learning, and thus really
    stop living. They become tight and very intolerant of new ideas and
    people unlike them. How sad! But you still desire to learn and
    change, and that&rsquo;s beautiful! You also love us all very much,
    and we know it. And you love Mom a lot, and it&rsquo;s neat to see
    you two together, because the love and caring is so sweet and
    evident.</p>
  <p class="western">Not only did KT say all those nice things, she
    didn&rsquo;t (as far as I can remember) owe me any money at the
    time. Certainly I owe her some after that! But there&rsquo;s more!
    She wrote again on 19 Dec 1977:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Hi Dad! I just finished watching a movie
    (Wilma) on TV. It prompted me to get off my butt and write down some
    feelings that have been inside me, growing, for the past several
    years. They concern you. I love Mom. She&rsquo;s the best lady I&rsquo;ve
    ever known (<i>and the same goes from your current author!</i>).
    She&rsquo;s the sweetest, most loving person I&rsquo;ve ever known.
    Any of my friends who have met her think she&rsquo;s so neat, so
    special. And of course you must have been impressed &ndash; you
    married her! At any rate, during the past few years when I was going
    to school and you were retired, (from 31 Mar 1973) we got to know
    each other better. You got to know me as Mom had always known me.
    Mom stayed at home and had the advantage (although she may not have
    always looked at it that way, ha ha!) of being around her kids and
    thus knowing them. So, although I knew you when I was younger, it
    wasn&rsquo;t in the same way as I knew Mom. It wasn&rsquo;t until
    you were retired and at home that I finally began to know my own
    father. All I can say is, thank God for retirement!</p>
  <p class="quote-western">You&rsquo;re so very special to me. You&rsquo;re
    such a proud father. You&rsquo;re so proud of your kids, and you
    love us, too. But fathers are funny sometimes. (Author-editor: God
    knows, I try to be all the time.) Often they don&rsquo;t know how to
    show their love, mostly because they&rsquo;re not used to it. I
    guess that&rsquo;s why your hugs mean so much to me. I guess that&rsquo;s
    why I like to get letters from you so much. Because you&rsquo;re
    special to me, Dad. And whenever you give me attention, show your
    love, or talk to me on the phone, it makes me feel special to you.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Mom knows I love her. All of us kids tell
    Mom that. But for some reason, because we&rsquo;re afraid of how
    you&rsquo;d react, we shy away from telling you that. I still
    remember so well one afternoon when I came into your room to talk to
    you about school and what I&rsquo;d do for a career. (This was a
    couple of years ago.) At any rate, you talked about yourself and
    when you were looking for a job after the war. You talked about your
    feelings of insecurity and discouragement. And this whole meeting
    touched me so much that by the time I got up to go, I was in tears.
    And when you saw the tears you looked surprised and then scared. You
    thought you had said something to hurt me. How funny &hellip; you
    said something that really touched me &hellip; you came nowhere near
    hurting me. For the first time <i>you talked to me as a person</i>.
    I saw a part of you that I had never seen before and I felt
    privileged. I saw the tender human side of you that I always knew
    was there but never really saw. It meant so much to me to have my
    proud father be human to me.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I was so relieved to find out that just
    because I felt discouraged, confused, or insecure about my future
    didn&rsquo;t make me a failure. It simply made me human. I always
    looked up to you and Mom as being perfect. And when I found myself
    falling way short of perfection I got worried. I thought to myself,
    I&rsquo;ll never be able to live up to my parents&rsquo; image. So,
    for you to let me in on the secret that you <i>weren&rsquo;t</i>
    perfect, and <i>you</i> got discouraged sometimes, even though you
    put on a show of confidence, really comforted me. By the time I got
    up to leave, I was crying I was so touched. And when you asked me,
    &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; I just
    said, &ldquo;Nothing, I just love you.&rdquo; Your reaction to my
    answer was so nice. You were so surprised. Here my big, old, proud
    father was taken aback, and it was so neat. It was neat to see that
    you were glad that I love you. It was neat to see my stonewall Papa
    be so moved. And I&rsquo;ll always remember that, Dad, and I just
    want you to know that you really are very special to me. You mean a
    lot to me. I guess you could say I&rsquo;m a <i>proud daughter</i>!</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Watching the relationship between the
    father and his children in the TV movie prompted me to write. Men
    are so funny sometimes; they need love and affection more than women
    do, yet supposedly it&rsquo;s the other way around. I guess that&rsquo;s
    why God made daughters &hellip; to teach their Daddies that it&rsquo;s
    OK to kiss and hug and talk.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, now you&rsquo;ve met them all &ndash; that
    is, <i>most</i> of you have met them all. But some of us have met
    still another &ndash; Herbie! He was born and died 3 hours later on
    19 May 1961. I named him after my father, and already they are
    together in heaven! His short life was all excitement from start to
    finish. First of all, his early afternoon &ldquo;move&rdquo; fouled
    up the St. Anselm car pool. Naturally, it had been Kathleen&rsquo;s
    turn to &ldquo;pick up.&rdquo; Again, the avalanche &ndash; the
    water broke. This was Great Grandma&rsquo;s shining hour. She called
    the ambulance, she cleaned up the damage. She notified me that the
    ambulance had once again &ldquo;done its thing.&rdquo; It took
    Kathleen to the Seventh Day Adventist Hospital in Takoma Park. Seems
    there was then an ongoing jurisdictional dispute that prevented the
    Wheaton Rescue Squad from venturing into the District. Not to worry
    the Adventist Hospital rerouted Kathleen to Columbia Hospital after
    a brief examination. Evidently they wanted no part of this one.</p>
  <p class="western">Thanks to Grandma not knowing about the Seventh
    Day Adventist diversion, I was already at Columbia when Kathleen
    arrived. As customary, she was a stream of blood down to her ankles
    &ndash; &ldquo;not a pretty sight,&rdquo; as the saying goes. I&rsquo;ll
    never forget her only words to me at that point until after Herbie
    had come and gone: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to take the rolls for
    dinner out of the freezer.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s Kathleen, all right,
    always thinking of herself. The situation was really precarious, but
    you&rsquo;d never suspect that from Kathleen&rsquo;s demeanor. It
    had to be a Caesarian (so called from an unsubstantiated belief that
    Julius Caesar was so delivered). It meant that Herbie had to be
    taken from the uterus by cutting through the walls of the abdomen
    and uterus. At her age it also meant <i>no more children</i>.</p>
  <p class="western">In due course Herbie was brought forth, to be
    immediately relocated to an incubator complete with respiratory
    mask. This was the first way I saw him &ndash; the one and only time
    any family member was to see him alive. He was a pathetic sight. It
    was truly difficult to judge whether he was in fact breathing, or
    being &ldquo;pumped&rdquo; up and down. He was duly baptized, but in
    a mere three hours he was gone. It was a sad time. After all, we had
    been looking forward to him for seven months. Fortunately, there
    were nine truly live ones already on hand to ease the pain. Kathleen
    and I will never forget the next evening, holding hands as we looked
    at all the new babies in the maternity ward nursery. Some sweet
    little young and &ldquo;new&rdquo; mother standing next to Kathleen
    immediately asked, &ldquo;Which one is yours?&rdquo; Kathleen just
    as immediately blurted out, &ldquo;Oh, ours died!&rdquo; Well the
    poor young lady was virtually devastated on the spot, but there was
    nothing we could do but quietly slink away. It just wouldn&rsquo;t
    do to say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, we&rsquo;ve already been
    blessed with nine others.&rdquo;<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote42anc" href="#sdendnote42sym"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
  <p class="western">Prior to the Mass and funeral I took all the
    children to Pumphrey&rsquo;s (Kathleen was still in the hospital). I
    only allowed the &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; older children to go in to
    view the body. I imagine this may have included George (then age 17)
    through Mary (then age 7). I expect I left Katie, Moni, and Mo in
    the car. Whoever it was I had left, they had an exciting tale about
    some woman who had parked in front or behind me while I was inside,
    and who had seemingly rammed our car. As they saw it, she was really
    concerned about whether or not she had hurt anyone. As for the
    remainder, they all got to see the little white coffin, barely
    bigger than a good-sized shoe-box, with this little well-lipsticked
    cherub. To me, it was a touching sight. Then came the funeral. Fr.
    Bonfiglio celebrated the Mass, then rode to the cemetery in the
    hearse.</p>
  <p class="western">At the cemetery he beheld our whole family except
    for the still immobile Kathleen for the first time. At the
    conclusion of the brief ceremony he came over to me and said
    apologetically, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were one of <i>these</i>
    Wrights.&rdquo; (Now, it could be argued that this tidbit might well
    have been omitted. After all, there is no dearth of animosity
    against the Church already. But I wish to make a point. The <i>Church</i>
    is <i>people</i>, and there are all kinds. Popes and priests are no
    less human than you or I, and we&rsquo;d be wrong to impute to the
    Church quite universal human deficiencies.) Anyway, and
    notwithstanding that ambiguous incident, the funeral was a tender
    family moment. I&rsquo;m told that at graveside I cried. I wouldn&rsquo;t
    be surprised, but it was because it was such a beautiful and tender
    family experience and Kathleen wasn&rsquo;t there to share in it.</p>
  <p class="western">There, now! You&rsquo;ve <i>really</i> met them
    all. This is the family which Kathleen and I (with the generous
    grace of Almighty God!) have managed to nurture through our more
    than 40 years of married life. Indeed, this is the family which has
    always been and continues to be our very life. It was fashioned in a
    span of a mere 16-and-1/2 years, between Nov of 1944 and May of
    1961. This was the period that extended from the battle of Leyte
    Gulf and MacArthur&rsquo;s return to the RPI, the sinking of the
    Tirpitz, the Battle of the Bulge, the birth of the A-bomb, the death
    of Hitler, the invasion of Europe on D-Day, and the advent of the
    kamikaze, to the first black Supreme Court Justice, urban riots,
    &ldquo;black is beautiful,&rdquo; Hare Krishna, Charlie Brown,
    Timothy Leary and LSD, and the tragic deaths of 3 astronauts in a
    practice session in a space capsule right here on earth! Many
    momentous happenings, these, but certainly not as momentous as the
    arrivals of George, Anne, Charlie, Martha, John, Mary, Katie,
    Monica, Mo, and Herbie. We haven&rsquo;t heard the end of them yet,
    of course, they&rsquo;ll be flitting in and out of our story in the
    pages ahead. All the foregoing was just sort of a preview, and an
    introduction to our cast of characters. But the beat goes on, and
    from now on we&rsquo;re all in this together.</p>
  <p class="western">Of course all memories by the children aren&rsquo;t
    all sweetness and light. It&rsquo;s frightening to learn how their
    most commonly shared recollection is one of fear of good old Dad.
    Perhaps, like the alleged &ldquo;good officer,&rdquo; a good father
    has to appear as a really mean SOB. Vince Lombardi raised this
    approach to a high art form, but I don&rsquo;t really believe in it
    for either leaders or parents. In fact, I&rsquo;d aver that resort
    to fear is more like seizing a crutch, a signal of an inability to
    handle either the situation or self. Besides, I could never feign
    that I only appeared to be a mean SOB &ndash; I was a mean SOB. This
    was a mistake. I knew it then and I confess it now. I hated my anger
    more than my children ever did. I wept over it many a time in
    secret.</p>
  <p class="western">I can&rsquo;t render my feelings in the matter
    better than St. Paul does in his letter to the Romans (7:15&ndash;24):</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I cannot understand my own behavior. I fail
    to carry out the things I want to do, and I find myself doing the
    very things I hate &hellip; though the will to do what is good is in
    me, the performance is not, with the result that instead of doing
    the good things I want to do, I carry out the sinful things I do not
    want. When I act against my will, then it is not my true self doing
    it, but sin which lives in me&hellip; What a wretched man I am!
    (Little wonder, then, that nobody recognizes better than I that we
    can&rsquo;t make it on our <i>own</i> &ndash; <i>we</i> need <i>help</i>!
    We can only make it by the grace of God. I&rsquo;m still
    struggling.)</p>
  <p class="western">Another surprising aspect of reported
    recollections by our children is how selective they tended to be.
    They all remember Dad smashing a hole in a wall with a wildly flung
    alarm clock, and they all remember the daily rages that accompanied
    my giving up smoking for Lent, such that their penance was
    considerably worse than mine. But no one mentioned how every Lent
    (and Advent) we would all announce the one good habit we&rsquo;d
    strive to add to our repertoire, and the one bad habit we&rsquo;d
    try to eliminate. I was surprised, too, that no one mentioned what I
    thought had been real treats, like NMO picnics with all the game
    stands and the sneaking of cokes to the car trunk, and the K of C
    Fourth of July picnics with foot-races and fireworks. And who could
    ever forget the joy of older kids proudly marching younger kids to
    unwanted T-bone steaks at Melvin&rsquo;s in Ocean City, while
    Kathleen and I enjoyed a separate table?</p>
  <p class="western">And how about the tramps through the monastery
    garden, and the catacombs, and hurtling down the cliffs on the GW
    Memorial Parkway (and Dad almost not making it back up)? Or who will
    ever forget the earlier Fourth of July picnics at the Meehan&rsquo;s
    (merely the prototype of our new annual forays to Martha and Gary&rsquo;s
    house). And there was John&rsquo;s famous bit on the grounds at the
    Washington Monument one Fourth of July when he begged Mom to cover
    his ears so his hands would be free to pick his nose? Or, recall the
    Holy Thursday bread and wine ritual, or the double-exposure film
    tableaux we staged on Dallas Avenue? Then there were the
    hosing-downs from the back steps, in lieu of baths on hot summer
    nights, with kids fighting for safety behind trees.</p>
  <p class="western">Hey! There&rsquo;s so much more, we&rsquo;ve done
    a lot of living together! Remember four of us, each holding one leg
    of the swing set, moving it via Lanark Way from Dallas to Kinross?
    Or Charlie being caught playing with matches, and my saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
    too old to spank. Hell! I&rsquo;ll do it anyway.&rdquo; After all,
    it turned out Charlie was the one who burned up the lot across the
    street from our house on Dallas Avenue. For years we all attributed
    it to &ldquo;somebody.&rdquo; Then there was Noel, John, and Charlie
    making fuses for Steve Shine&rsquo;s firecracker. But then it was
    Charlie, too, who squirreled his arm through the car radiator grill
    up to the armpit to open a defective hood latch, thereby getting his
    shirt so greasy he got to skip a May procession one year. This could
    have been about the time I removed the automatic choke from the
    Chrysler, stalled at St. Bernadette&rsquo;s, and hurled it clear
    across University Blvd. into Indian Spring golf course [now the new
    campus of Blair High School]. Or remember the day the accelerator
    linkage broke on the DeSoto at Mayo Beach, and we drove all the way
    home through a thunderstorm with it held together by scotch tape?
    And who didn&rsquo;t love the way I slopped Bronze Tan on, first at
    Mayo, later at Ocean City?</p>
  <p class="western">Of course, there&rsquo;s a logical explanation
    for these gaps in our children&rsquo;s recollections of their
    childhood years. I think Anne put it best in one of her letters (18
    May 1978):</p>
  <p class="quote-western">That is the amazing thing about our family,
    Dad. I lived in a different generation than some of my sisters. My
    childhood memories are some 15 years older, because by the time I
    was in high school there was a different bunch of little kids living
    in our house, building up a different set of memories. The
    fascinating thing is that it is a composite of these different sets
    of memories that comes closest to what you and Mom must have
    experienced. I don&rsquo;t remember silly incidents which Moni and
    Maureen and probably even Katie cherish. I wasn&rsquo;t around.
    Likewise, they weren&rsquo;t around in any of my early childhood
    memories.</p>
  <p class="western">There you have it. We in effect raised a series
    of small families, which are only now, as the age gap of childhood
    contracts into the uniformity labeled &ldquo;adulthood,&rdquo;
    congealing into a single, unified, large family. It is our hope that
    these pages may hasten this congealing process. And in this
    connection, we must not just be caught up solely in the happy
    superficialities of our family life. We should also reflect on the
    common substructures of our life together.</p>
  <p class="western">In this more serious regard I would naturally be
    tempted to cite our religion. Unfortunately, too many people (and
    too often, I&rsquo;m ashamed to have to say, <i>with proper cause</i>)
    regard &ldquo;religion&rdquo; as just another <i>four-letter word</i>.
    But, says Harvey Cox, &ldquo;We can talk about sex now, and maybe we
    can soon talk about religion.&rdquo; If so, it may well be begun by
    our sometimes still resisting offspring, since, as Harvey goes on,
    &ldquo;Christianity did not begin in the fields of the Greek
    philosophers, but in the boondocks.&rdquo; So a resurgence of
    religious fervor may well be in the offing, even in our very midst.
    In fact and as of now, an antipathy for organized religion, most
    especially as it was reflected (or perhaps misrepresented) via our
    children&rsquo;s elementary school-teaching nuns, still seems to
    persist in certain of our children.</p>
  <p class="western">They take a dim view of Catholic schools
    generally, and especially the superstition-loaded &ldquo;brain-washing&rdquo;
    perpetuated by some nuns under the guise of theology. To them it was
    a poison not yet altogether purged from their systems. They became
    angry, as indeed they should. As Graham Greene has said, anyone &ldquo;who
    cares for nothing finds it difficult or absurd to be angry.&rdquo;
    Anger, furthermore, is the tip-off that another butterfly is about
    to emerge from the stifling cocoon of childhood. It is a signal to
    rejoice at the discovery of independence &ndash; a recognition of
    personal values. All of this is not only normal, it is good. The
    trick, of course, is not to throw the baby out with the bath water.
    A high order of discretion is also necessary. Unfortunately,
    discretion is learned only many, many years after anger. The latter
    is almost an instinct, the former has to be cultivated through long
    experience.</p>
  <p class="western">In any case, &ldquo;religion&rdquo; is today a
    pejorative term. So let us eschew this word and phrase the matter in
    different terms. Let&rsquo;s (with thanks to author Judy Frank) talk
    about maps! Everybody knows my addiction to maps &ndash; which is
    second only to Kathleen&rsquo;s addiction to lists &ndash; and what
    we <i>tried</i> to do was give our children a map of life. So&hellip;</p>
  <p class="quote-western">A few words in praise of maps. Diagrams of
    what&rsquo;s out there and how to find it. Can you think of a more
    abundant source of innocent entertainment, of information and
    instruction, than representations of the whole or a part of an area?
    Somebody in charge of school curricula should make the three Rs
    subordinate to a course in map-reading. That ought to be the first
    thing children are taught after crayoning inside the lines &hellip;
    in fact, they&rsquo;d all be better off if they could start out
    crayoning blue for the ocean, green for mountains, yellow for
    deserts. As soon as the little tykes are old enough to beg for an
    expedition to Busch Gardens or the 7-11, they should be given a road
    map and put in charge of all navigational commands.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">A compelling reason to succeed will help
    focus their attention. A spur to success. I&rsquo;m sure there must
    be surveys proving how map-reading sharpens up eye-brain
    coordination &hellip; &ldquo;turn left here, watch speedometer for
    1/3 of a mile.&rdquo; And it certainly offers reinforcement to such
    good concepts as <i>clarity of thought</i>, not to mention being
    <i>master of your fate</i>, <i>captain of your ship</i>, etc. My own
    experience cites map-reading as a litmus test for the sort of folk
    who are satisfactory to deal with. Map people are good people. If
    they can read a map, I&rsquo;m going to enjoy them; if they can&rsquo;t,
    watch out.</p>
  <p class="western">Let me add just a word here. It is our belief
    that if only our children stick to <i>our</i> map well, they&rsquo;re
    all going to make it &ndash; and I&rsquo;m not talking about &ldquo;to
    the 7-11&rdquo;! So, here&rsquo;s to our children! We love you
    madly, and our wish for you is fair winds and following seas! And
    for chrissakes, don&rsquo;t forget the flaming map!</p>

	&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Ruskin</span></p>
  <p class="western">I reported aboard the light cruiser USS Amsterdam
    (CL101) at Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 22 Jan 1945. She was a virgin,
    new-construction ship that had just completed fitting-out and
    shake-down. Officially, she was <i>ready for duty</i>, but it would
    be a while before she was ready for combat. We were off almost
    immediately for extended training exercises out of Guantanamo Bay,
    Cuba (where the weather is almost as constantly perfect for
    sea-going training as Pensacola is for flying instruction). So began
    a three-year-plus tour of sea duty that would take me all the way to
    Tokyo Bay a mere three days after V-J Day, 2 Sep 1945. I wouldn&rsquo;t
    see Kathleen and George again, who relocated from Solmson Heights to
    my parents&rsquo; home in April, thence to the Kirk family home in
    June, and thence to an apartment in Mt. Rainier with Aunt Luie and
    &ldquo;Little Joe&rdquo; Woods, until they rejoined me virtually a
    year later in San Diego the following December.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">So, it was back
    to sea once again, but this time there were some significant
    differences. The Navy was no longer the central focus of my
    attention. Now I not only had a wife, I had a young son. Another
    major difference arose from my rank. I had left Tuscaloosa a
    Lieutenant. I joined Amsterdam as a Lieutenant Commander. This was
    only a one-grade step, but it represented an elevation (or was it
    the opposite?) from the more-or-less anti-establishment <i>junior
      officer</i> brigade to the uniformly loathed senior officer
    establishment. It was sort of like transitioning from labor to
    management. There was (and probably still is) always a tension
    between junior and senior officers, and I confess straight off that
    I never really felt comfortable as a senior officer. I always had to
    literally work against a tendency to over-familiarity and downright
    camaraderie with my junior officers. At the same time, I always felt
    my peer group of senior officers ranged from stuffy and stiff to
    outright snobs or SOBs.</p>

    The <i>Commander</i> with proud parents</h3>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">In any event, my
    greatest difficulty stemmed from the fact that I now had actually
    tasted shoreside family life. I can well remember driving into our
    family garage with my Pop for the last time. We had been on some
    errand together, and apparently I&rsquo;d been unusually quiet. As
    my Pop put on the brake, and before getting out of the car, he
    asked, &ldquo;Is everything all right?&rdquo; Sad to say, I just
    broke down and cried. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want to leave my
    family,&rdquo; I blurted. Well, I left them many a time after that,
    many times to face genuine danger, but it was this first parting
    that I still recall as by far the toughest. Once at sea, of course,
    you were not only too busy to give much thought to the family, you
    were shielded by the further recognition that there was no way
    (certainly in wartime) that they could contact you or you them. It
    is this fact which at the same time engendered a sense of family
    irresponsibility in many husbands, and a sense of independence in
    many wives &ndash; a mixed blessing at best.</p>
  <p class="western">In any event, the job once again got all my
    attention. It was easy to concentrate on what had to be done. We had
    to get ready fast to fight, and perhaps to die, and this time we
    knew we were headed for the anything-but-Pacific! Meanwhile, in the
    Atlantic, where we were still operating for the moment, the Germans
    had upped the ante with the fleet introduction of the snorkel, which
    greatly enhanced the operational flexibility of their deadly
    submarines. In early Feb, FDR conferred at Yalta with Uncle Joe
    Stalin, with traitor Alger Hiss looking over his shoulder. On 19 Feb
    1945 the Marines stormed Iwo Jima. General Howland (Howling Mad)
    Smith termed it the Marine Corps&rsquo; most costly battle in
    history, before the famous flag-raising was photographically
    recorded for all posterity on my 27th birthday (24 Mar 1945).
    Meanwhile, in Europe the Allies had crossed the Rhine on 7 Mar 1945.</p>
  <p class="western">So the war was very hot indeed from east to far
    west, even as we honed our skills midway between in the
    semitropical, paradise-like climate of the Caribbean. We were
    underway everyday, drilling gun crews and damage-control crews.
    Every item of gear and equipment was checked, tested, and rechecked.
    Drills were run, critiqued, and rerun. After all, this was not only
    a new ship, it was a new crew. Not only did teamwork have to be
    relearned by veterans, a major percentage of the crew was pea-green
    new recruits with no seagoing experience whatsoever. Time was short
    and everything was all business. Our cups were filled to the rim
    with grim. To indicate just <i>how</i> grim, after only two months
    aboard I got the worst fitness report of my entire career, with only
    five of nineteen marks being within the top 10% in the naval
    service. Even so, they grudgingly conceded, &ldquo;He has the
    required [acquired?] initiative and planning ability to promote an
    efficient and smooth-running organization. He will make an excellent
    Chief Engineer.&rdquo; Damn right!</p>
  <p class="western">I managed to get home for one brief, final
    east-coast leave the last week in March 1945. I recall my Pop&rsquo;s
    53rd birthday of 28 Mar 1945. After a nice dinner complete with
    birthday cake and ice cream, he and I were leaning over the back
    porch rail together, chatting, with him on my left. My mother,
    Kathleen, and sister Margaret were in the kitchen cleaning up. I
    have no idea where my brother was, and I have no idea what my father
    and I were chatting about. But one thing remains etched in my brain,
    if only because a mere 15 days later my father was suddenly dead of
    a massive heart attack. I therefore vividly remember that last
    evening on the back porch. I suddenly turned to my father, put my
    arm around him, and kissed him smack on top of his bald head. &ldquo;You
    know I love you,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you, Pop?&rdquo;
    He responded appropriately in kind, and it was a most tender and
    touching moment. I could hardly know I&rsquo;d never again see him
    alive, but we had closed the circuit. We had unknowingly made our
    final peace. For me it was and remains a beautiful moment. (I&rsquo;m
    delighted to say that I similarly made a final peace with my mother,
    although well before she died. It&rsquo;s important to remark,
    however, that this equally tender moment came as a direct result of
    this very writing project, in the course of which &ndash; haven&rsquo;t
    you already guessed &ndash; I came to realize that I am more my
    mother&rsquo;s child than my father&rsquo;s, and that I owed her
    everything and loved her a great deal indeed.)</p>
  <p class="western">So we come to the fateful day (not just for me,
    but for our country and the world) of 12 Apr 1945. I had returned to
    my ship, then hooked up to a dock in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, for
    last-minute debugging of equipment. So it was that I was able to
    pick up on a shoreline phone-ring in my Engineering Log Room office
    shortly after noon. Uncle Bernie was on the line. He wasn&rsquo;t
    cut out to work for the State Department or the Diplomatic Corps,
    you know, he was to become a flinty steel IRS man. &ldquo;Is this
    you, Jack?&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;Your father died this morning of
    a heart attack.&rdquo; Now, that&rsquo;s what I call really breaking
    the news! I was stunned. Needless to say, with having just returned
    from leave, the other half of my department then on leave, and
    frantic preparations underway to leave for the Pacific in a mere 7
    days, I had one hell of a time getting leave even to travel the mere
    225 miles to Washington for the funeral. But there is still more to
    the story of this fateful day. At 1535 FDR died of a stroke. This
    news was on the radio by 1747, just about when I was finally leaving
    the ship for the Greyhound bus station in Norfolk for a fast run (6
    hours for 225 miles!) to DC (as the bus hit every en route military
    station in Virginia).</p>
  <p class="western">Well, FDR&rsquo;s death really turned the world
    weird. When I got to the bus station they were already playing
    funeral-like music over the PA system. That was the way it was to be
    for the next four days. Radio commercials were completely suspended.
    Movies were closed down. The whole nation suddenly switched into a
    state of shocked mourning. Wherever you were, all you heard were
    dirges. While I was home I dropped into the Franciscan Monastery for
    confession. The organist was practicing Dies Irae (Day of Wrath, the
    ultimate funeral hymn) for an upcoming FDR memorial mass. I remember
    Mrs. MacKavanagh (after whom Monica Louise is named) saw me and
    immediately set off to have the organist desist until I had left &ndash;
    a nice, if unnecessary, touch. It was as though the whole country
    had fallen into step with my personal funeral procession.</p>
  <p class="western">Incidentally, and still speaking of weird, to our
    boys in the Pacific all of this was even more ominous. In the
    Pacific this all happened on <i>Friday, the 13th</i>! So FDR, our
    great wartime leader, and Pop, the would-be great peace-maker, both
    left us on 12 Apr 1945. By the 18th all German resistance ceased. On
    the 20th Mussolini was strung up by his fellow countrymen. On the
    30th Hitler did himself in by his own hand. All-in-all, Apr 1945 was
    a very deadly month. This was the atmosphere in which I set forth
    for the final months of the war in the so-called Pacific.</p>
  <p class="western">We transited the Panama Canal in late Apr 1945. I
    virtually missed this, too. After all, my special sea detail was at
    main propulsion control in the forward engine room. You really don&rsquo;t
    see much scenery from that vantage point. In exasperation I finally
    took a chance and dashed topside for a minute or two &ndash; long
    enough to see them transit one lock to another, and switch cables
    from one diesel engine puller to another. It was a marvelous if
    quick study in team-work between the ship&rsquo;s company and their
    extremely competent dockside counterparts. (And, after transiting 21
    locks on the Rhine between Nijmegen and Basle, I can assure you if
    you&rsquo;ve seen one lock, you&rsquo;ve seen them all!) Then it was
    on to Pearl Harbor for a brief replenishment stop. It was at Pearl
    that we got the news of the epic battle begun at Okinawa on Easter
    Sunday 1 Apr 1945.</p>
  <p class="western">We didn&rsquo;t know it then, but this was to be
    the last amphibious operation of WWII. The plan was the brainchild
    of Vice Admiral Kelly Turner, whose head, Morison says, could
    conceive more new ideas and retain more detail than any other flag
    officer in the Navy. Also participating in the battle were my old
    English Prof, now Captain John B. Heffernan, skipper of the
    battleship Tennessee, and my old Bancroft Hall main office watch
    officer superior and grease sponsor, now Rear Admiral Jerauld
    Wright, who commanded a Demonstration Group which laid on a fake
    landing at the southern tip of Okinawa. The landing itself was a
    piece of cake due to the enigmatic Japanese decision to voluntarily
    retire from the beach area proper. The worst was yet to come, both
    ashore and at sea.</p>
  <p class="western">I don&rsquo;t want to labor the details of this
    momentous battle, since I happily had no part in it. It was
    effectively concluded by 22 Jun, while Amsterdam only joined
    Halsey&rsquo;s famed 3rd Fleet in early Jul, just in time for the 10
    Jul&ndash;15 Aug final carrier plane assault on the Japanese home
    islands. Nevertheless I must give some brief indication of the
    nature and intensity of the battle for Okinawa precisely because it
    presaged the savage climate into which we were about to enter, and
    therefore had a profound effect upon us mentally. What happened was
    that at Pearl we picked up battle damage reports from initial phases
    of the Okinawa operation. These were hot off the presses from the
    Bureau of Ships in Washington, D.C.</p>
  <p class="western">It can&rsquo;t be stated too strongly what a
    remarkable product these battle damage reports were. The smoke of
    battle would be scarcely cleared before engineering and damage
    control personnel throughout the Navy would hold in their hands
    complete analyses of damage inflicted, damage control measures taken
    (and which should have been taken), and the results. Needless to
    say, such reports, complete with detailed 3-dimensional (isometric)
    sketches, were invaluable in educating all concerned with what to
    expect and how best to deal with it. (It&rsquo;s sort of like my
    library read-down on the subject of coronary surgery prior to my
    operation.) It is supremely helpful to be fully prepared &ndash;
    there were no surprises after that.</p>
  <p class="western">At the same time, you&rsquo;d be lying not to
    admit to fear and trepidation. Among the threats at Okinawa was the
    Japanese super-battleship, Yamato, whose nine 16-plus-inch guns
    could hurl 3200-pound shells 22-1/2 miles. (This, incidentally, was
    to be the last battleship ever built. No nation was ever to build
    another, though President Reagan still resurrects them as I write in
    1984.) Still, the main story at Okinawa lay elsewhere with the
    dreaded kamikaze suicide planes. All in all, the Japanese launched
    2,550 kamikazes and still had 3,350 left as we arrived on the scene.
    One half of the kamikaze sorties occurred between 6 Apr and 22 Jun,
    in the Okinawa campaign! Nor was that even the end of it. Okinawa
    also saw the first use of the baka bomb. This was a rocket-boosted
    glider, complete with suicide pilot, which was slung on the under
    belly of a two-engine bomber, and then released over the target
    where it became a 260-lb., 500-mph guided missile. This assortment
    of instruments-from-hell really put the fear of God in every man
    present. FDR had coined the phrase that we had nothing to fear but
    fear itself. I can assure you that was enough.</p>
  <p class="western">Even so, you can never safely discount the spirit
    of the American fighting man. Two examples from the period warrant a
    brief mention. Both are drawn from the battle off Samar, an episode
    in the Leyte Gulf operation of the fall preceding Okinawa. Here were
    a few tin-can-like CVEs up against 4 battleships and 6 cruisers. All
    the CVEs had going for them were 5- and 40-mm guns. As the Japanese
    charged in for the kill, a Chief Gunner in White Plains sang out,
    &ldquo;Hold on a little longer boys, we&rsquo;re sucking them into
    40-mm range!&rdquo; A bit later a Wildcat Avenger attack from a
    nearby U.S. carrier force suddenly hit the Japanese, who shortly
    broke off the action. This elicited a yell from a signalman in
    Fanning Bay, &ldquo;Goddammit, boys, they&rsquo;re getting away!&rdquo;
    (Notably, this spirit endured at least through Korea, where we had
    then-Marine Colonel Chesty Puller exclaiming, &ldquo;The enemy is in
    front of us, behind us, to the left of us, and to the right of us.
    They won&rsquo;t escape <i>this</i> time!&rdquo;) Yes, I was wrong
    earlier when I contended that we merely machined our way to victory.
    Our fighting men were really something else, too!</p>
  <p class="western">So Okinawa came and went. And in the immortal
    words of Maxwell Smart, I &ldquo;m&#8209;I&#8209;s&#8209;s&#8209;e&#8209;d
    it by <i>that</i> much!&rdquo; (Actually I didn&rsquo;t <i>miss</i>
    it at all. That was plenty close enough for me, and it sure kept you
    on your toes!) After all, the Navy suffered 34 ships sunk at
    Okinawa, and another 61 damaged. The biggest and most courageous
    victims were the radar pickets, vulnerable Destroyer Escorts placed
    alone on the far periphery of naval formations to sound the early
    warning of incoming kamikazes. They themselves became prime kamikaze
    targets. And, despite our huge losses, they might have been
    infinitely worse except for the battle-proven value of our
    fire-fighting and damage-control schools. Still, when all was said
    and done, this epic conflict was just another steppingstone on the
    long journey to Japan. It was of Okinawa that Fleet Admiral Chester
    Nimitz said, &ldquo;Uncommon valor was a common virtue.&rdquo;
    Churchill marks the battle of Okinawa among the most intense and
    famous in military history. But history was already tending toward
    peace.</p>
  <p class="western">We know that <i>now</i>. Those of us on the scene
    <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> know it <i>then</i>. Still, the signs were
    already in the air. Even as we crossed the International Dateline,
    the world marked that 8 May 1945 as <i>V-E Day</i>. And the United
    Nations conference had already begun at San Francisco in Apr. The 46
    nations there represented concluded their deliberations on 26 Jun
    with their issuance of the United Nations Charter. Nevertheless, the
    war was still in full swing, and other ominous signs were still on
    the horizon. On 13 Apr our old shipmate Admiral Leahy told our new
    President Harry Truman that the ongoing Manhattan (atomic bomb)
    Project was the biggest fool thing we have ever done. Later he was
    to add, &ldquo;The bomb will never go off, and I speak as an expert
    in explosives.&rdquo; The scenario for the end was now set. Things
    were now happening at a frantic pace, like the speeded-up tempo of a
    running-down clock.</p>
  <p class="western">Even as Kathleen and George were relocating from
    the apartment in Queenstown to her folks&rsquo; house on Otis
    Street, I was relocating from west longitude to east longitude. I
    was initiated into the ranks of the ancient sea-going order of
    <i>Golden Dragons</i>. I was the senior officer to be so initiated,
    and as such assumed leadership of the opposition. The worthy
    opposition was led by my Oil King, Chief Watertender Turner, who
    merited that post by virtue of being the oldest <i>Golden Dragon</i>
    aboard. So, the battle was really a good-natured but fierce battle
    within the Black Gang itself. The final highlight came when Ensign
    Daly and I finally fell back to the boat deck where we held off the
    mounting hoards of <i>Golden Dragons</i> with a high-pressure
    firehose until Turner had the fire pumps secured. Then it was our
    turn to wriggle through the garbage-laden towing sleeve which at the
    same time served as a gauntlet well-manned by stick-flaying <i>Dragons</i>.
    We finally emerged battered and bruised, then to be hosed down with
    salt water and immediately set down on a chair, which turned out to
    be a truly <i>electrifying</i> experience! OUCH!! Life goes on in
    the Navy even in wartime.</p>
  <p class="western">As most every WWII buff knows, the giant carrier
    Task Force charged with pressing the attack on Japan in the last six
    months of the war was by turns labeled the 3rd or the 5th Fleet,
    depending on whether commanded by Admiral Bull Halsey or Midway hero
    Admiral Raymond Spruance, who spelled each other about every 60&ndash;90
    days. So it was that the 5th Fleet became the 3rd Fleet for the very
    last time on 27 May 1945, even as Amsterdam closed on Pearl Harbor,
    there to become a unit of CruDiv 8. We thereupon sailed west to join
    up with the 3rd Fleet for the final 10 Jul&ndash;15 Aug assault on
    Tokyo. We maintained station during this period, which comprised 37
    days at sea, just 170 miles southeast of Tokyo. There Amsterdam
    became known as the Flying Red Horse (then a popular Mobil Oil
    Company logo) as a byproduct of our daily refueling of 3 destroyers
    every morning before breakfast. Literally, we were serving as a gas
    station.</p>
  <p class="western">It was in this setting that I&rsquo;d take up
    station beside my Oil King, Turner, at the forward starboard fueling
    station every morning at dawn. This was always a frantic time of
    high anxiety and tension, since we were so close to the enemy
    homeland and were literally sitting ducks while hitched to a
    parallel destroyer by two six-inch fueling hoses and therefore
    constrained to hold a fixed course. Little wonder that the Skipper
    was forever yelling down from the wing of the bridge, &ldquo;How
    much longer, Chief?&rdquo; Invariably I&rsquo;d ostentatiously
    remove my slide rule from my shirt pocket, manipulating it
    furiously, all the while beseeching Turner out of the corner of my
    mouth for the answer. Turner, of course, was on the fueling-at-sea
    phone circuit, in direct conversation with snipes below deck busily
    engaged in continuous sounding of the tanks as to their level of
    fullness. Needless to say, my little mini-drama with the slide rule
    was <i>very</i> impressive and always carried the day. I was dubbed
    the smartest Chief my C.O. ever had. (Appearances, unfortunately,
    are sometimes everything.)</p>
  <p class="western">Now the war really began to wind down in a hurry.
    On 17 Jul 1945 Truman was already at Potsdam carving up the European
    peace. By 25 Jul the British were already feeling so secure that
    they dumped Churchill for Clement Atlee. Graffiti from a Gibraltar
    sentry box seems apt:</p>
  <p class="poem-western">God and the soldier all men adore,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
    time of trouble and no more.<br/>
    When war is over, and things are
    righted,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is neglected and soldiers
    slighted.</p>
  <p class="western">Meanwhile in the Far East the war was <i>really</i>
    on the wane. We&rsquo;re talking about 6 and 9 Aug 1945, folks. On 6
    Aug we dumped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. On 9 Aug we dumped
    another atomic bomb (<i>Fat Man</i><span style="font-style: normal">)
	</span>on Nagasaki. The moralists (with good reason, in my opinion)
    have been dumping on these decisions ever since. (Whenever you hear
    discussions today on the doctrine of first use, remember <i>these</i>
    dates. The question is already moot. <i>This</i> <i>was</i> first
    use! Let us pray it was also <i>last</i> use.) In all events, the
    complexion of war immediately and completely changed &ndash;
    <i>forever</i>! If ever there was a situation where the old canard,
    &ldquo;I guess you had to be there,&rdquo; was apt &ndash; <i>this
      was it</i>!</p>
  <p class="western">What a transformation of mood and spirit these
    two explosions effected in anyone then serving in the 3rd Fleet!
    Here we had horizon-to-horizon hulks packing devastating destructive
    forces. Surely this had to be the mightiest armada of all time. Two
    puffs in the sky suddenly rendered it all
    second-rate-to-meaningless. One minute you felt a part of the
    mightiest force in history; the next moment you felt like nothing,
    overtaken by history, obsolete. It was an awesome feeling, and it
    reflected a lesson our military leadership still hasn&rsquo;t
    digested, but more on this later. (I&rsquo;m referring to the
    futility of giant modern fleets.) Just consider this: <i>each and
      every SAC pilot rides more destruction than launched by the sum
      total of all allied bombs in WWII!</i><span style="font-style: normal">)</span></p>
  <p class="western">Little wonder that Marines were landing unopposed
    at Yokasuka by 28 Aug, that V-J Day came on 2 Sep, and Amsterdam
    herself was steaming peacefully into Tokyo Bay by 5 Sep. PEACE!!! It
    was wonderful. It was also very strange. The reason this was so
    lurks in a remark of Mussolini: &ldquo;War alone brings up to its
    highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon
    the peoples who have the courage (or are forced) to face it.&rdquo;
    As cited earlier (see motto for Chapter <a href="#war">IX. </a><a href="#war">WAR</a>),
    historian Will Durant reinforces the notion: &ldquo;We have to
    acknowledge war as &hellip; the ultimate form of competition&hellip;
    [It] is the father of all things, the potent source of ideas,
    inventions, institutions, and states.&rdquo; True. After months of
    almost unbearable tension and excitement, in constant fear for your
    very life, peace came as a real letdown. You had a sense of
    uselessness, of futility. A wave of ennui engulfed all hands.
    Immediately one objective subsumed all others: <i>let&rsquo;s get
      home!</i></p>
  <p class="western">However, before we move on, let&rsquo;s pause a
    moment to salute the architects of our victory. We have, of course,
    already paid an extended tribute to the master FDR. After him
    (speaking only of American leaders), Harry Hopkins deserves special
    mention. As Joseph Alsop has noted, &ldquo;He not only wielded great
    authority, he enjoyed the President&rsquo;s absolute confidence, and
    saw more of him day-to-day than any other person.&rdquo; In
    addition, as you go further up the scale of human quality among the
    men who served America and Britain so well in the war years, you
    find that the admiration for Hopkins grows greater and the affection
    warmer until you reach the top of the scale with Winston Churchill
    and General George C. Marshall. Churchill went so far as to
    admiringly dub Hopkins &ldquo;Lord Heart of the Matter.&rdquo;
    Passing to the military realm, Alsop had this to say: &ldquo;It is
    to be doubted, in truth, whether the American government ever
    boasted before, or will boast again, such a constellation of great
    American public servants and military leaders as Washington
    contained in the Second World War&hellip; I wonder &hellip; whether
    we shall ever see another leader of the U.S. Army with the
    all-around greatness of George C. Marshall, or an Air Force leader
    with the tough, concentrated intelligence and crafty courage of H.
    H. Arnold, or a Chief of Naval Operations to compare in fighting
    spirit and general astuteness with grim, relentless Ernest King.&rdquo;
    As for me, my fitness report for the period showed an increase to
    eleven out of nineteen marks within the top 10%, and noted that I
    displayed great initiative and good judgment in performing all
    assigned duties in a manner which guaranteed to achieve the best
    possible results. Hey! What&rsquo;s new?</p>
  <p class="western">With the end of the war, Amsterdam was employed
    in the ferrying home of troops between Pearl Harbor and the west
    coast beginning in Oct 1945. Our first post-war return to the states
    began from Pearl Harbor on 9 Oct 1945, when we set forth for
    Portland as a unit of Halsey&rsquo;s entire 3rd Fleet as it got
    underway en masse for the last time, passing in review before
    Honolulu &ndash; <i>where it had begun </i>just a little less than 4
    years before.</p>
  <p class="western">En route to Portland we stopped briefly at
    Astoria, Washington. There we discharged approximately 100&ndash;150
    ill crew members, the majority of whom were ambulatory. Lucky thing,
    too, because the illness was bacillary dysentery which literally
    kept you running in every sense (acquired when we were tied up
    briefly alongside dysentery-plagued USS Birmingham in Tokyo harbor),
    and which ended up rendering those so afflicted totally unfit for
    duty. Thereafter, for several weeks all hands (all <i>fannys</i>,
    really) had to line up outside sickbay daily while a not-so-gentle
    corpsman ran a brace and bit up your spread <i>cheeks</i> to take a
    culture, which was then studied between glass plates under a
    microscope. This routine naturally inspired a snipe from Engineering
    <i>Repair Five</i> to parade up and down outside sickbay everyday
    with a huge 15-inch-long by 1-1/2-inch-diameter brace and bit. (A
    brace and bit, of course, is a hand-cranked drill.)</p>
  <p class="western">We arrived off Portland, Oregon, on 16 Oct where
    we disgorged 1,000 Seabees from Okinawa. While the Kirks took care
    of George in Washington, Kathleen flew out and was there to meet the
    ship. We remained there through the 27 Oct Navy Day festivities, and
    as the first fighting ship to come to Portland in five years, our
    welcome by the city was simply fantastic. I remember one childless
    couple who introduced themselves to Kathleen and me on the street,
    and then voluntarily chauffeured us all over town. They even
    transported us out to Multnomah Falls, the famed salmon spawning
    area, and ended up having us into their home for dinner. Virtually
    everybody invited you into their bottle club (where their private
    stock was stored in personal lockers) and instructed the attendants
    that we were their guests with unlimited access to their goodies. It
    was unbelievable the joy and openness of the whole deal.</p>
  <p class="western">Of course my personal joys were almost always
    accompanied by woes. Kathleen and I had only a brief time together,
    then it was back to DC for her, and back to the far Pacific for me
    or rather, back and forth to the far Pacific. We had practically
    served as a tanker toward the end of the war, and now that peace had
    come we were to serve as a troop carrier &ndash; a returning troops
    carrier. In the following flurry of forays back and forth to the
    west coast from the far Pacific, I particularly recall one overnight
    turnaround in San Francisco. The ship&rsquo;s doctor and I (since
    doctors, even as the fictional Hawkeye, seemed to especially share
    my antiestablishment bent) went ashore about 1700 one afternoon. We
    ended up at a cozy little bar called The Backyard. (I can&rsquo;t
    help wondering if it&rsquo;s still there, and further wonder if I&rsquo;d
    risk being caught dead there today.) In any event, we discovered the
    smoothest drink I&rsquo;ve ever enjoyed in my life &ndash; the Royal
    Gin Fizz, which is made with sloe gin and a whole raw egg. As Red
    Skelton used to blurt and burp about Guzzler&rsquo;s Gin,
    <i>s&#8209;m&#8209;o&#8209;o&#8209;t&#8209;h</i>!</p>
  <p class="western">We managed to get back to the ship just as
    morning quarters was being sounded on the bugle. Moreover, we were
    literally bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. That is, this marvelous
    drink seemingly had no lingering adverse effects. I don&rsquo;t know
    why I even bother to mention this, except that it is such a pleasant
    memory. It goes without saying that this mini-binge was occasioned
    by acute homesickness, severely aggravated by being a part of the
    operation Magic Carpet which was returning thousands of deliriously
    happy servicemen home, while we ourselves had to wave goodbye and
    head back out to the far Pacific for another load. This was a most
    trying time for the spirit. It was as though we&rsquo;d all been to
    an exciting party, and now the party was over, and everybody was
    going home, but we had to lag behind to clean up the mess. All was
    not lost, however. I turned what might otherwise have been a
    monstrously boring and demoralizing time to good use. I had
    accumulated a rather excellent shipboard library, thanks to my now
    departed father and to Kathleen. It was during this immediate
    post-war period, especially at sea, that I set about plowing through
    all these books. I especially remember <i>The Catholic Pattern</i>
    by Thomas Woodlock, the four-volume <i>Companion To The Summa</i> by
    Dominican Fr. Walter Farrell, and a six-volume study set from Sheed
    and Ward that included such classics as Belloc&rsquo;s <i>Survivals
      and New Arrivals</i>, Chesterton&rsquo;s <i>What&rsquo;s Right With
      The World</i>, and Arentzen&rsquo;s <i>What Think Ye of Christ?</i></p>
  <p class="western">All in all, these carefully digested and
    thoroughly marked-up books provided an excellent foundation in the
    philosophical-theological fields. As William Osler has pointed out,
    &ldquo;There are four kinds of readers: sponges which absorb
    everything without distinguishing; hour-glasses which receive and
    pour out as fast; bags which only retain the dregs and let the wine
    escape; and sieves which retain the best only.&rdquo; Osler then
    went on to observe that a man wastes a great many years before he
    reaches the sieve stage. I must confess I feel I am an exception. I
    think the pressure of Mr. Puhl at Columbia Prep compelled me to
    graduate to the sieve stage very early on.</p>
  <p class="western">Perhaps this is the time to remark my lifelong
    love affair with books, which I feel have been a tremendous
    influence in my life. I suppose my chief thanks in this regard must
    go to Sr. Regina and my Pop. Both encouraged me and funneled me into
    the realm of truly good literature. (I find it totally impossible
    even today to suffer even a few pages of trash such as spewed by the
    likes of Irwin Shaw, Harold Robbins, and Andy Greeley. The poor
    quality of the writing just inhibits any possibility of enjoyment.
    Conversely, I can become completely absorbed in the masterful
    literary mechanics of an artist such as Graham Greene, even when the
    substance is such fluff as constitutes <i>Our Man In Havana</i> or
    <i>Dr. Fischer of Geneva and the Bomb Party</i>.) Of course I&rsquo;ve
    already noted how the <i>Book of Knowledge</i> actually led me to
    pursue a naval career, and I&rsquo;ve conceded that it was Edgar
    Rice Burroughs who first stimulated my present propensity for
    reading. I agree with Graham Greene&rsquo;s statement, &ldquo;The
    influence of early books is profound&hellip; Early reading has more
    influence on conduct than any religious teaching.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Soon I was reading Chesterton, C.S. Lewis, St.
    Thomas, Garrigou-LaGrange (the foremost Dominican theologian prior
    to Vatican II), Bernard Haring (my favorite moral theologian), Karl
    Rahner (then the greatest living theologian), Teilhard de Chardin
    (still highly underrated in my opinion, possibly because &ndash;
    like John Kenneth Galbraith, who suffers the same handicap &ndash;
    he was a cross-discipline scholar, and thereby incurred the jealous
    wrath of both disciplines), not to mention the writings of such as
    St. John Vianney and St. Catherine of Siena. Of course I can still
    enjoy the entertainments of John MacDonald (who projects more
    philosophical substance than one might suspect), Ian Fleming, John
    LeCarre, and Maryland&rsquo;s own James M. Cain. At least these
    fellows can write extremely well. (From Greene I learned that vivid
    descriptions were confected by minimizing adjectives and adverbs in
    favor of nouns and verbs, and also by appealing, in turn, to all
    five senses. From McCain I learned that tempo could be accelerated
    by alternating lines of dialogue which omitted the identity of the
    speaker, compelling you to rush on lest you lose the thread of who
    was speaking.) Certainly, I was never taken in by hype. For example,
    as briefly alluded to earlier, at a very early pre-<i>Tarzan</i>
    age, a schoolteacher neighbor gave me some allegedly true adventure
    stories by a then-well-publicized predecessor of Lowell Thomas (of
    <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> fame) named Richard Halliburton. I found
    them barf-bait. Finally, I wonder how many people you might find who
    have read <i>Bartlett&rsquo;s Quotations</i> cover-to-cover. You
    <i>know</i> I did! And now you know a lot more about me. As Silas
    Mitchell once said, &ldquo;Show me the books he loves and I shall
    know the man far better than through mortal friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Post-war life at sea was, however, not totally
    devoted to thinking, studying, and reading. There still were moments
    of high excitement. One incident that is etched in my memory is the
    loss of lubricating oil pressure on the #2 propulsion system
    reduction gear during one of my morning watches. (Yes, friends,
    demobilization had already so depleted our ranks that by Nov 1945
    the Assistant Chief Engineer was already reduced to having to go
    back on the watch list.) This oil system not only provides
    lubrication for the reduction gear, it also serves the main
    propulsion thrust bearing (which absorbs and transfers the 30,000
    horsepower of the propeller into the ship&rsquo;s structure), and
    the high-and low-pressure main propulsion turbines.</p>
  <p class="western">Needless to say, if these things continue to
    rotate long without an oil supply, you can end up with a pile of
    junk in a hurry. What you have to do, of course, is stop the main
    propulsion shaft from rotating. This isn&rsquo;t a simple matter of
    closing the steam throttle to the turbines, since the shaft will
    continue to rotate as a consequence of propeller drag. At the same
    time, the engineer watch officer must alert the OOD on the bridge,
    alert the Chief Engineer, and &ndash; since you&rsquo;re operating
    in a fast-moving and very tight formation &ndash; direct the
    appropriate increase in speed of the three remaining shafts so as to
    maintain constant ship&rsquo;s speed. This is real bedlam time,
    folks! I immediately alerted the various parties and directed the
    proper adjustments in the three operating shafts. I was, of course,
    in the main propulsion control station in the forward engine room,
    whereas the disabled propulsion system was located in the after
    engine room.</p>
  <p class="western">When I contacted the Chief Engineer he told me to
    remain where I was, that he&rsquo;d proceed to the after engine room
    and take care of the emergency. Needless to say, by the time he got
    there he found me already on the scene. And what a scene it was! The
    ambient noise level in an operating engine room is on the order of
    100&ndash;110 decibels. (Oh, really? Hey! All you have to do is
    think Fahrenheit. Eerie quiet would be 32 degrees and below like
    walking in snow whereas sound, like heat, really becomes offensive
    above, say, 90 degrees. Got it? And, while I&rsquo;m at it, I&rsquo;ll
    tell you another peculiarity about noise. You&rsquo;ll find you can
    accommodate to any noise as long as: (1) it is steady, and (2) you
    know you can&rsquo;t do anything about it! Failing one of those
    conditions, the slightest noise can drive you crazy! End of
    instructional segment!) This is the clime in which the Chief
    Engineer and I thereupon exchanged screaming curses. &ldquo;Goddammit!&rdquo;
    he shouted, &ldquo;I told you to stay where you were!&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Goddammit!&rdquo; I bellowed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the sack
    and I wanted it done right&rdquo;! Back he screamed, &ldquo;You
    sonovabitch! That was a direct order!&rdquo; And back I came, &ldquo;You
    stupid bastard, can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m busy!&rdquo; Members
    of the black gang in attendance were incredulous, and during all of
    this I was, in fact working furiously. It&rsquo;s a race against
    time, and it&rsquo;s a tricky business. As they say about the gusto,
    &ldquo;You only go around once,&rdquo; that is, you only get one
    shot at performing this operation properly.</p>
  <p class="western">The way you stop a shaft from turning when you&rsquo;re
    in a Task Force moving at 15 to 25 knots requires exquisite
    cooperation between the throttleman and the guy (me!) at the
    reduction gear. The two principals can&rsquo;t see each other, and
    we exchanged info (between the foregoing exchange of curses) over
    the sound-powered phone each of us had cocked over one ear. This
    communication is critical, since the throttleman cannot see the
    propeller shaft and has no sufficiently sensitive indication of
    shaft movement. What the throttleman is trying to do is to
    momentarily stop the shaft&rsquo;s rotation by bleeding short blasts
    of steam into the astern turbine, trying to balance the thrust of
    the dragging propeller. Meanwhile, the guy at the reduction gear
    (me) is watching the propeller shaft itself as it emanates from the
    rear of the reduction gear. The instant it appears stopped, it is my
    job to apprise the throttleman and immediately engage the jacking
    motor on the reduction gear, and then whip on its shaft-locking
    brake. If you attempt to engage the jacking motor when the shaft is
    other than dead-still, you merely strip off all the teeth on the
    jacking motor shaft.</p>
  <p class="western">You&rsquo;ve got to be sharp. You&rsquo;ve got to
    be fast. You&rsquo;ve got to be precise. It helps not to have
    distractions. It&rsquo;s a really critical situation, and as you can
    see, I really <i>did</i> once work for a living. (The jacking motor
    is a small electric motor that can be clutched into the reduction
    gear to enable slowly rotating the shaft during main engine warm-up,
    thus precluding warping of the main turbines by slowly rotating them
    as warm-up steam is bled in.) Well, the propitious moment came, and
    the deed was safely done. Everybody sighed in relief and stepped
    back. The Chief Engineer and I glowered at each other for a moment
    then simultaneously broke out into huge grins and laughed
    uproariously. Now the tense crew was relieved, too.</p>
  <p class="western">Yes, we still had our exciting happenings. This
    Chief Engineer (my last, as ever after I was to be the Chief
    Engineer), was a Cdr. Garvin, and he was almost as off-the-wall as
    Bruce Garvin of Kinross Avenue fame. For one thing he actually
    carried fancy calling cards which were simply but elegantly
    engraved, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Chief.&rdquo; (Perhaps if I&rsquo;d
    ever have made <i>full</i> Commander, I&rsquo;d have felt the same
    way.) He was also the one who would always sing out &ldquo;Tallyho!&rdquo;
    whenever the Supply Officer would appear in the wardroom for meals.
    You have to know that the Engineer and Supply officers are
    traditionally bitter enemies aboard ship &ndash; one striving for
    more and better tools and supplies, the other always fighting
    limited budgets. Moreover, a careless Supply Officer could mess up
    an Engineer Officer in other ways. For example (and this is another
    engineering insight I picked up via a round-table seminar at PG
    school), on one occasion our shipboard refrigeration plant seemed to
    be on the blink. We were unable to maintain adequately low
    temperatures in several central refrigeration compartments. Well,
    before you tamper with the apparatus, the first (and sometimes the
    only necessary) thing to do is to check and make damn sure the
    Supply Officer hasn&rsquo;t blocked off all circulation to the
    cooling coils by improper dense-packing of stores.</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, Cdr. Garvin was asked one day to explain
    this <i>Tallyho!</i> business, which he did, thus: It seems there
    was this uneducated driller who once struck oil real big and became
    an instant multimillionaire. Soon he was traveling in style all over
    the world. In England he was invited to participate in a royal fox
    hunt. When the fox was suddenly flushed from cover the oilman
    shouted out, &ldquo;There goes the sonovabitch!&rdquo; Thereupon he
    was in very proper English fashion corrected, &ldquo;Oh, no, my dear
    boy! Over here we just say, Tallyho!&rdquo; Well, at least Garvin
    and I respected each other.</p>
  <p class="western">We also had our real downers. In Dec 1945,
    Kathleen and George relocated to the West Coast just in time for
    Christmas together with me. As recounted earlier, this was not to
    be. It was sort of an instant replay of the fractured Christmas of
    the preceding year. Remember? Then they had packed me off to (Good
    grief, Lucy!) Philadelphia. This time it was the occasion of my
    Sentimental Journey (with Doris Day) to Hawaii, but we&rsquo;ve
    already covered this. By Jan of 1946, only three months after the
    conclusion of virtually a four-year world war, the Army was already
    discharging one million soldiers a day! Peacetime had come with a
    vengeance. Our own ranks were depleted so fast that in Jan of 1946
    we were moved to the San Francisco area to commence decommissioning
    of the CL101. Amsterdam was going to be put into mothballs in the
    Reserve Fleet.</p>
  <p class="western">This was the time, incidentally, upon my return
    from Hawaii when we moved bag and baggage from Long Beach to
    Richmond, California. This was the time of our trek in the &rsquo;31
    Buick (using 40 quarts of oil!) laden with ironing board on one
    fender, high chair on the other, crib behind the spare tire in the
    rear, and George on the crib mattress atop all our belongings
    crammed into the back seat area of the car.</p>

  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">These were the
    days of the migrating Okies and we fit right in. I&rsquo;ll never
    forget cresting the mountain in Bakersfield and beholding the cities
    of Tulare, Fresno, Merced, Modesto, and Stockton strung out like
    sparkling jewels on a strand that was the highway &ndash; a
    beautifully impressive sight.</p>
  <p class="western">For example, there were the cases of the three
    Chief Petty Officers who were charged with being drunk while on
    Shore Patrol. I defended the first one and we won an acquittal. The
    Skipper thereupon appointed me as prosecutor in the second trial,
    and I won a conviction. Naturally, the 3rd Chief protested my
    potential assignment as prosecutor, stating he had a right to have
    me represent him in his defense. Our Solomon-like Skipper thereupon
    solved the dilemma by appointing me a member of the Summary Court
    itself, thereby rendering me a neutral judge. The foregoing legal
    performance won me a substantial following among the crew, and I
    became in great demand. In fact, the word was so well spread via
    liberty parties that I was soon getting requests from sailors in
    other ships in harbor requesting my services.</p>
  <p class="western">My main recollection about all this is that
    though it was extremely interesting and very rewarding work, it was
    in fact damn hard, long, and tedious work. It required careful
    research, extensive preparation, and tremendous concentration and
    alertness in court. The latter proceeding invariably left me
    completely drained. And, after all, I was concurrently still
    carrying the full burden of my engineering duties. Nor was that the
    worst of it. All too soon I became caught up in the awesome anxiety
    arising from recognition that my activity was substantially
    affecting the lives of the accused.</p>
  <p class="western">For example, I&rsquo;m still haunted by my
    prosecution of Electrician 2/c Fairchild, one of my own snipes. We
    had a group of reserves aboard for a training cruise, and at
    disembarkation time the suitcase of one of the departing reserves
    turned up missing from the quarterdeck. A few days later my Warrant
    Electrician discovered the missing suitcase stashed inside the
    locked-for-security cage behind #1 main switchboard. His
    investigation ultimately focused on Fairchild, and I was assigned as
    prosecutor at his Summary Court Martial. Well, I won a conviction,
    but unlike the petty penalties normally associated with drunkenness,
    AWOL, and the like, Fairchild was sentenced to beaucoup years hard
    labor in the naval prison at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Believe me,
    the magnitude of this life impact put the fear of the Lord in me and
    took a lot of the fun out of my legal machinations.</p>
  <p class="western">On the other hand, there were some happy
    triumphs, too. I&rsquo;ll never forget how a chubby and rather
    cherubic Commander Ingalls almost rolled off his chair with laughter
    when I presented him with a letter addressed to the Bureau of Naval
    Personnel. This was a case where a CPO had shipped-over (extended
    his enlistment) some six months before on the basis of certain
    monetary bonus inducements that were then being offered. Subsequent
    to this action, the Office of the Judge Advocate General had ruled
    that certain of the stipulated benefits were null and void since
    they exceeded the authority of the Department of the Navy to grant
    them. Thereupon the Chief came to me with the plaint that under
    these new circumstances he wouldn&rsquo;t have extended his
    enlistment. He asked me if he had any recourse. I researched the
    relevant facts and applicable law and suggested he had nothing to
    lose if he&rsquo;d sign a letter I&rsquo;d prepare, and that he had
    an excellent chance of getting released. Needless to say the Chief
    readied his fountain pen to sign on the spot. Our letter cited the
    relevant before-and-after provisions of the Navy&rsquo;s enlistment
    offer, and then concluded to the effect that since the Navy had
    arbitrarily, unilaterally, and capriciously altered the terms of his
    enlistment after the fact, that they had effectively abrogated the
    contract and the Chief was entitled to immediate release.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, Cdr. Ingalls thought this was just about
    the funniest, wildest thing he had ever heard, but if we insisted
    (he was the Executive Officer) he would forward the letter. We
    insisted. Unfortunately, Cdr. Ingalls had been transferred by the
    time (barely a month later) that the Judge Advocate General approved
    the requested release. Little wonder, then, that I was by now hooked
    on the law. When I got ashore I went searching for law books. I
    bought a copy of Blackstone&rsquo;s classic <i>Commentaries</i>, and
    Oliver Wendell Holmes&rsquo; classic <i>The Common Law</i>. More
    than that, the United States Armed Forces Institute then provided a
    broad range of legal correspondence courses. I completed <i>Principles
      of Business Law</i> on 31 January 1946; <i>Introduction to Business
      Law I &amp; II</i> with distinction on 28 February 1946; <i>Advanced
      Principles of Business Law I &amp; II</i> on 26 March 1946; and
    <i>Advanced Business Law</i> on 26 March 1946. I was busy! This,
    however, completed the law material available through USAFI.</p>
  <p class="western">By this time we were relocated from Richmond
    (just north of Oakland) to Midway Village (just south of San
    Francisco), and on 13 Mar 1946 I formally applied for law school
    under Navy auspices, which was then being provided by George
    Washington University in our own hometown. My Skipper, Capt. Gerald
    D. Linke, endorsed it as very highly recommended. He further
    commented that I was excellently suited, and that I had performed
    all my duties in a capable and <i>unusually</i> [he says!] thorough
    manner. Having first set forth in my application how I met all the
    requirements for such assignment, I then added the following:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The applicant pleads the following
    additional qualifications:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">(a) A keen inherent interest in the law
    attributable to hereditary and environmental influences coincident
    with being the son of a law professor. That this interest has been
    long sustained is a matter of record, as witness the applicant&rsquo;s
    original preferences for future service employment as recorded in
    his original Reports of Fitness and Qualifications Questionnaires.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">(b) Pre-Navy educational achievements in
    related fields, consisting of: four (4) years of Latin;
    comprehensive Ancient History, outlining the development of the
    Civil Law; and elementary Logic.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">(c) A quasi-industrial background as
    acquired while attending a course in Engineering Design. This course
    afforded a series of ten (10) lectures on industry, emphasizing the
    development of capital-labor relations, unions, contracts,
    liabilities, workingman compensation acts, etc.; and a ten (10) week
    field trip covering several major industries, which provided a
    first-hand insight into liaison relationships existing between the
    government and industry. The course further benefited in the means
    of acquiring a technical vocabulary; and an understanding of
    principles frequently confused during formal investigations of
    service casualties, and subject to consideration in litigation
    involving breach of governmental contracts.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">(d) <i>The Harvard List of Books for
    Prospective Law Students</i> states &ldquo;Law students and Lawyers
    are confronted with many stimulating problems, which can be solved
    only after hard thinking, carefully planned.&rdquo; Accordingly,
    Reference (A) (a proposal to the Pope, forwarded by the Apostolic
    Delegate, to initiate evening masses) is presented as unsolicited
    evidence of a definite ability in the related fields of logic and
    philosophy. The question in point was one of canon law, the
    necessary background for which was largely obtained by an
    assimilation of a wide assortment of theological-philosophical
    documents, including the Bible.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">(e) Arthur Train&rsquo;s <i>Yankee Lawyer</i>
    states &ldquo;The law is pre eminently a literary profession. Words
    are the lawyer&rsquo;s media of exchange.&rdquo; Accordingly,
    attention is respectfully invited to the fact that while the
    applicant had a low Naval Academy class standing, his standing in
    English and Composition was markedly high, he once having attained a
    standing of 35 in the class for that subject. In addition, he served
    in the capacity of feature writer for <i>The Log</i> staff for one
    year, and has written publicly for profit. References (F) and (G)
    (two reports of machinery derangement, one of which was then
    confidential, and both of which are covered elsewhere herein) as
    originally drafted by the applicant are offered as evidence of an
    ability to construct formal written reports of complicated
    incidents.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">(f) The applicant has sustained his
    interest in the law by continual collateral reading of legal
    treatises and associated literature, including: <i>Gavit&rsquo;s-Blackstone
      Commentaries, Harper on Torts, Holmes-Pollock Letters</i>, and
    government publications on the Walsh-Healy Act and the
    Norris-LaGuardia Act, etc. This active interest is further attested
    to by the completion of available USAFI courses in law as witness
    Enclosure (B).</p>
  <p class="quote-western">(g) The applicant has actively participated
    in practical military law by serving successfully as Recorder,
    Member, and finally Senior Member of Summary Courts Martial.</p>
  <p class="western">In April I enrolled for a regular pre-bar law
    course with LaSalle Extension University (in Chicago), concurrently
    registering with the state of Virginia as a bona fide law student.
    This entailed them getting satisfactory monthly reports from the
    University on my progress. It also involved my being aligned with a
    resident Virginia member of the bar, a sort of sponsor. How did I
    manage the latter? I went to the library and checked Martindale and
    Hubble&rsquo;s several-volume compendium of all lawyers in the U.S.,
    complete with a background and rating summary of each. At the same
    time I studied Virginia for optimum locales in which to raise a
    family and settle down in civilian life. I had been through a
    similar exercise earlier, that is, before I got associated with
    Virginia via the law. I had assiduously studied the entire U.S. to
    determine the most favorable locale. This study was governed by two
    major considerations: an adequate cultural center that would afford
    the maximum naturally attainable safety from the threat of any
    atomic war in the future; and my realization through Navy travel
    that Bermuda was beautifully warm while Washington wallowed in ice
    and snow, i.e., there was a wide choice of climes, and one need not
    be wedded to a less favorable one merely because of the accident of
    being born there. This exhaustive study led to the selection of
    Lincoln, Nebraska! I liked its unique unicameral legislature, low
    taxes, high culture, and its midway location well inland between the
    Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. How ironic that even as I chose it for
    safety, it was being transformed into a prime target of atomic
    warfare, being only miles from Omaha, where the military was even
    then installing the Air Force&rsquo;s Strategic Air Command Center.
    Well, at least this confirmed my view of the area&rsquo;s relative
    insulation from danger.</p>
  <p class="western">This time I settled upon Lynchburg and Roanoke
    (not too big, not too small, and close to Washington), contacted a
    few choice single-member law firms, and lo and behold, I had a
    sponsor. In May of 1946 we moved from Coral Sea Village to a Quonset
    hut in Midway Village on or near the naval shipyard at Mare Island.
    Also by May, I had received official disapproval of my request for
    legal training by the Navy. Not to worry, the overall program was
    still on track, and I was enjoying life with my family. This is the
    time and place where on daily walks I apprised George of all the
    engine nomenclature on a nearby tractor. It is also the time and
    place where we made a home recording of George reciting all this
    nomenclature and more (which record I believe George still has).</p>
  <p class="western">Two other particularly favorite memories of our
    Quonset experience are, first, that another nearby Quonset housed a
    soda fountain to which we regularly trekked for ice cream cones. The
    other memory concerns the visible pulsating of the Quonset&rsquo;s
    walls to the base viol during the daily airings of Duke Ellington&rsquo;s
    band then playing somewhere in the area. One memorable tune of the
    time was <i>Just Squeeze Me</i> featuring Ray Nance&rsquo;s trumpet
    and vocal.</p>
  <p class="western">But, moving right along, by July we had relocated
    once again, this time to a beautiful little Spanish-type furnished
    house on Santa Paula Way in Vallejo. By now the war was already a
    memory. By June 1946 some 12.8 million men and women were already
    returned to civilian life by the military. Moreover, the Philippines
    were granted their independence on 4 July 1946, and the atomic bomb
    testing experiments on the fleet were already underway off Bikini
    Atoll in the Marshall Islands. On 26 Aug 1946 I was detached from
    CL101, the Amsterdam, with orders to report as Chief Engineer to
    CA131, the heavy cruiser Bremerton. In my nineteen-month tour in
    Amsterdam we had earned one battle star on our Pacific area ribbon
    for our participation in the 3rd Fleet&rsquo;s final strike on the
    Japanese home islands. In the Amsterdam I had also learned of atomic
    bombs and made the transition from war to peace. It had been a
    historically momentous period even as it was a brief tour.</p>

    USS Amsterdam arrives in Astoria, Washington<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote45anc" href="#sdendnote45sym"><sup>45</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">There was, however, no real affection on my part
    in favor of Amsterdam as a ship like there was (and continues to be)
    for Tuscaloosa. To be sure, I would miss my immediate friends and
    shipmates in the black gang &ndash; Ace Foster, Charlie Feldhaus,

    with upward mobility) who graduated during the war to commissioned
    ranks.</p>

    Newspaper clipping about USS Amsterdam&rsquo;s arrival<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote46anc" href="#sdendnote46sym"><sup>46</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">Fleming was 6'6&quot; tall, with a matching
    robust physique. He was menacingly huge, and yet owned a gas-miserly
    English car called an Austin.<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote47anc" href="#sdendnote47sym"><sup>47</sup></a>
    These were a miniature auto breed, precursors to and smaller than
    the VW Beetle to come. Fleming used to fold himself into the car
    like a carpenter&rsquo;s rule &ndash; a truly comic operation. He
    couldn&rsquo;t even wear the flat overseas hat in the car &ndash; it
    would have put him through the roof. I&rsquo;ll never forget the day
    the four of us &ndash; me, Ace, Charlie and Red &ndash; were en
    route somewhere in the Austin when some guy suddenly cut in front of
    us and stopped abruptly, causing us to brake sharply with the force
    of a reverse catapult. The guy comes back to Fleming&rsquo;s
    driver&rsquo;s side window and starts haranguing him about his
    allegedly having previously cut him off. Fleming heard him out
    without saying a word. Then he slowly opened the door and started
    unfolding himself out of the car. By the time he was his fully erect
    6'6&quot; the other guy was back in his car and roaring madly away.
    Yes! I&rsquo;d miss these guys.</p>

    Photo of USS Amsterdam in Astoria<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote48anc" href="#sdendnote48sym"><sup>48</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">My fitness report from Captain Linke upon my
    detachment was one of the very best I ever received. Of the 19
    rating factors, I was marked within the top 10% in 16. The other
    three factors (standing deck watches underway, reactions during
    emergencies, performance in battle) were simply marked unobserved.
    (The engineer, after all, does labor unseen in the bowels of the
    ship.) Beyond that, Captain Linke noted that &ldquo;LCdr. Wright is
    an energetic, capable, and intelligent officer who performed all
    duties in a most excellent manner.&rdquo; He went on to add: &ldquo;He
    has maintained the engineering installation and personnel of his
    department at a high degree of upkeep and efficiency under
    constantly adverse conditions of personnel shortage (occasioned by
    rapid demobilization). He displays commendable degrees of initiative
    and devotion to duty.&rdquo; Well, at the worst this just goes to
    show you can fool some of the people some of the time. Personally,
    I&rsquo;ve always thought that Capt. Linke was an outstanding judge
    of men.</p>
  <p class="western">In any event, with my detachment and the receipt
    of this report, our little family now settled into about a 2&ndash;3
    week period of high anxiety. We were still living on Santa Paula
    Way, and each morning I would put George in his wagon and drag him
    several blocks to the nearest phone booth. Each day I had to check
    in with the Military Air Transport Command at Moffett Field
    regarding the first available transportation to Guam, out of which
    Bremerton was currently operating. Kathleen would stand at the
    kitchen window (unbeknownst to me at the time), watching for our
    return, and trying to judge what the answer had been. When the
    fateful news came that I&rsquo;d finally caught a ride, though, she
    had been unable to detect any such sign from my demeanor. (It&rsquo;s
    too bad she couldn&rsquo;t have seen into my crestfallen heart.)</p>
  <p class="western">So it was that about 1000, just a few days <i>before</i>
    our 4th wedding anniversary (yes, Mary, the military split us
    unfeelingly for that, too!), I learned that I&rsquo;d be departing
    from Moffatt (some 35 miles SE of San Francisco) for the far Pacific
    that very night at 2200. The trip would begin by an Air Force bus
    leaving from central San Francisco. For a combination farewell and
    wedding anniversary celebration, Kathleen, George, and I set out to
    San Francisco for a fancy dinner at one of <i>Bagdad by the Bay</i>&rsquo;s
    most famous restaurants, Luigi&rsquo;s. This was one of those old
    style western restaurants that you see nowadays only in the movies.
    For example, we shared one of those curtained-off private booths.
    The meal was sumptuous, but we were hardly in a holiday mood. It was
    a tender, loving time, an almost quiet time. At least this time it
    wasn&rsquo;t as if I was going off to be possibly blown away in a
    war. Partings, nonetheless, do remain such sweet sorrow.</p>
  <p class="western">The trip to Guam was memorable. All my gear was
    in a previously forwarded cruise box (which was to be received
    aboard a good month after my arrival). I was truly traveling light.
    All I had with me everything was the gray (now obsolete) uniform I
    was wearing (with overseas flat hat, no cap), and a small zippered
    packet in my pocket containing tooth brush, comb, and shaving gear.
    That was it! Right off the bat, on the very first leg of the flight
    from SFO to Pearl Harbor, I spilled a cup of black (ugly brown,
    really!) coffee in my crotch. Luckily, the coffee wasn&rsquo;t all
    that hot, but traveling the rest of the 5000-plus miles (we made
    stops at Johnson Island, Kwajalein, and Midway also) with a huge
    brown stain at the crotch was deeply embarrassing, to say the least.
    It had the aura of a truly bad case of front-end diarrhea. At Pearl
    Harbor, during a fairly lengthy layover between flight connections,
    I traveled from Hickam Field to Ford Island, there to visit prior
    Solmson Heights neighbor Dottie Tyng for an afternoon&rsquo;s swim
    at the Ford Island Officer&rsquo;s Club. She couldn&rsquo;t leave
    the house later that evening to drive me even to the boat landing,
    let alone to Hickam Field, so I set out per instructions to walk to
    the boat landing, after which I could catch a military bus to Hickam
    Field. Well, I got lost, and for so long, that when I finally got
    off the island I had to catch a cab to Hickam that cost me a small
    fortune and just barely made my plane connection.</p>
  <p class="western">I was never so frightened of possible fouling-up
    in my life. (The only other near-miss of comparable anxiety was
    Kathleen and I dashing to Point Loma to verify my Navy travel orders
    incident to our trip to California after George&rsquo;s crash. See
    Chapter <a href="#crash">XVII. CRASH</a>.) But, soon I was off and
    island-hopping to Guam again. At Midway, as I was getting ready to
    reboard, who should come walking into the flight center from the
    tarmac, in full flight gear, but my old USNA roommate, Ab Street.
    This was only the second time I&rsquo;d seen him since graduation,
    and it turned out to be the last time I&rsquo;d ever see him alive.
    A few years and four children later he died of cancer. The meeting
    was all too brief, we hardly got to exchange hellos. Until then I
    hadn&rsquo;t even known he had gone into aviation. He was no dummy,
    though, he opted for &ldquo;driving&rdquo; the virtually fool-proof
    old reliable PBYs we had first met during second class summer.</p>
  <p class="western">But <i>my</i> adventurous trip still wasn&rsquo;t
    over. When I finally got to Guam, Bremerton was at sea. So I spent
    several days literally sweating it out on Guam. Believe me, Guam is
    the humidity capital of the universe! I remember sitting in bottom
    shorts and not another thread, at my BOQ room desk, writing letters
    home, and having to shield my letter with another sheet of paper to
    protect it from the constant drip of perspiration from my brow, and
    the moisture bathing my writing hand and arm. You had to leave bulbs
    on in the closets, around the clock, to fight the moisture and
    mildew, and every morning you checked your shoes for geckos before
    slipping your feet into them. And, of course, there was the daily
    1630 downpour, which abated 20 minutes later but left everything
    even more drenched and steaming, so that going to the evening movie
    was like taking a sauna bath. I was glad when the day finally dawned
    when a coxswain of a motor launch from Bremerton finally came
    looking for me, and I joined the Bremerton at last. This was on 17
    Sep 1946. As with the Amsterdam, I was to remain aboard Bremerton
    for 19 months. Well, there was one exception to remaining aboard
    during that period. I was briefly and temporarily attached to USS
    Dayton, to conduct a formal Admiral&rsquo;s Inspection of its
    engineering plant. Normally this was a 3-day gig that included an
    underway battle damage exercise. Unfortunately for me, Bremerton was
    moved from Tsing Tao to Shanghai in the interim, and I had to remain
    aboard a few extra days, until I could catch a flight to Shanghai
    from the Military Air Transport Command. This little 350-mile
    journey was more exhilarating than might be surmised, since it
    entailed a two-hour sitting-duck posture as we flew over communist
    China. Sort of exciting!</p>
  <p class="western">The balance of the year of 1946, Bremerton
    operated in the Marianas Islands (where I discovered stingers at the
    <i>Top of the Mar</i> [for Marianas], the Guam O&#8209;Club, the
    name of which was fashioned after that of San Francisco&rsquo;s Mark
    Hopkins Hotel&rsquo;s <i>Top of the Mark</i>), off Japan, China, and
    the entire west coast of the U.S., ranging from San Diego to the
    Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. One exciting incident of this period was
    the day our Skipper tried to make the green light on F Street (which
    was effectively a continuation of the Navy Pier) in San Diego. We
    were entering port to tie up at the dock for a few days of R &amp;
    R. As usual, my underway sea detail station was at main engine
    control in the forward engine room, and I had my smoke watch on
    station at the rear end of the signal bridge. At sea it was
    important not to make smoke since you could then be detected thereby
    while still well over the horizon from a potential enemy. Going in
    and out of port, what with rapid maneuvering of the engines and
    consequent sudden up and down demands upon the boilers, making smoke
    disclosed a sloppy unprofessionalism. At all times making smoke
    betrayed a highly inefficient operation. Hence any proud Chief
    Engineer (who, me?) stationed a smoke watch who immediately relayed
    an alarm to the fireroom at the first hint of smoke.</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, I always kept one ear plugged into the
    1JV maneuvering phone circuit so as to monitor topside action
    through the eyes of my smoke watch. He had told me we were already
    alongside the seaward end of the pier, a couple hundred yards from
    the seawall at the shoreside root of the pier, and were coming in
    &ldquo;awfully damn fast.&rdquo; So it was that I was expecting a
    &ldquo;full speed astern&rdquo; order. Instead, we suddenly got a
    &ldquo;full speed ahead&rdquo; order over the engine annunciators. I
    was immediately on our machinery intercom screaming, &ldquo;Disregard
    the annunciators, give &rsquo;em full speed astern!&rdquo; I yelled
    this several times, noted from the gauges they had so responded, and
    I then notified the bridge of my disregard of orders. Well, this was
    chancy stuff, indeed! I had put my neck in a sling, and had to be
    ready for the chopping block.</p>
  <p class="western">Each throttleman has a bell sheet at his throttle
    on which law requires him to enter each and every engine order and
    the time of receipt, and the Engineering Watch Officer must sign
    these official logs as the last entry on his watch. I immediately
    signed both of the forward engine room log sheets with a note re my
    countermanding the order received, and told the Chief of the Watch
    in the rear engine room to do the same &ldquo;on instruction by the
    Engineer Officer.&rdquo; Our dangerous initiative was now a matter
    of the official record. Meanwhile, our smoke watch had screamed,
    &ldquo;Jesus Christ! I think the old man is trying to make the green
    light on F Street!&rdquo; At the same time, the Skipper ordered both
    anchors to be let go, and the starboard one actually pierced a barge
    secured just to the right of our bow at the seawall. We then
    actually nosed into the seawall but ever so gently.</p>
  <p class="western">Of course there had to be a board of
    investigation. My 1JV talker, my Logroom Yeoman (Engineer&rsquo;s
    Office secretary), was called to testify, and I was scheduled to be
    called. They asked him, &ldquo;And when the order for &lsquo;full
    speed ahead&rsquo; came, what did the Chief Engineer do?&rdquo; The
    yeoman calmly replied, &ldquo;He screamed, &lsquo;The goddam old man
    must be out of his mind,&rsquo; and told everybody to &lsquo;Give
    &lsquo;em full speed astern.&rsquo;&rdquo; Obviously, the undeleted
    expletive was pure invention. <i>Strangely (?)</i>, I was never
    called to testify. But I ask you: don&rsquo;t you think I should
    have gotten a (expletive deleted) medal? I mean Bremerton could have
    ended up safe at second base in what is now Balboa Stadium, several
    blocks up F Street!</p>

    Passing under Golden Gate</h3>
  <p class="western">So I didn&rsquo;t get a medal for saving Padre&rsquo;s
    Park from Bremerton&rsquo;s kamikaze attack, but a month or so later
    I did garner an official commendation for something else. Sometimes,
    it seems, an engineer&rsquo;s most exciting times come when the ship
    is in port &ndash; hold it! &ndash; and the engineer is still aboard
    ship! Remember my boiler-cleaning-deferred late liberty in Lisbon,
    and the ensuing surrender of my sword? Well, our Navy Day 1946 trip
    up the Columbia River is another case in point. This time the
    problem was a high-pressure, super-heated steam leak from the
    throttle chamber of the high-pressure turbine driving our starboard
    outboard propeller. Well, such a leak simply can&rsquo;t be
    tolerated. To begin with, it represents a danger to life. Second, it
    represents a severe loss of precious feed water, every drop of which
    we had to provide through energy-consuming shipboard evaporators.
    Finally, high-pressure super-heated steam that penetrates even a
    slight defect then proceeds to act as an acetylene torch in its
    cutting action, continuously increasing the size of the hole until a
    great blow-out materializes. More than that, we were well up the
    Columbia River.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, it turns out that the Columbia River has
    the greatest water volume flow rate of any river in the world, so
    the current is fierce. Beyond that, we&rsquo;d be moving downstream
    such that the current would compound our momentum. Also the Columbia
    River from Portland to the sea might better have been labeled the
    Snake River, for all its twists and sudden turns. It wouldn&rsquo;t
    do to try to negotiate it on only 3 engines, especially since the
    defective one was tied to one of the outboard propellers which are
    the most effective for maneuvering purposes. Clearly the leak had to
    be fixed before we could get underway. Two problems: we didn&rsquo;t
    have any spare high-pressure piping suitable for super-heated steam;
    and anyway, you needed advance permission from the Bureau of Ships
    in Washington <i>before</i> you could weld on any vessel carrying or
    containing high-pressure super-heated steam.</p>
  <p class="western">We not only fixed the damn thing, I got a
    personal commendation for the job. As for getting a piece of
    suitable replacement pipe, our blueprints indicated the drain on the
    high-pressure super-heated steamline connecting the forward and
    after engine rooms (a flexibility provision to accommodate potential
    war damage to one or another engineering space) was of the same
    specification as our defective turbine drain. We simply cut out a
    section of required length. This entailed wiring shut and tagging
    all associated valves for this crossover line, lest somebody open it
    and thereby spew live steam into the area of the cut-out section of
    the pipe. (During the Korean War, when Bremerton was recommissioned,
    I got a note from my old shipmate. &ldquo;Recalled&rdquo; Ens.
    Converse wrote, &ldquo;Chief! You&rsquo;ll be happy to know your
    wires and tags were still in place and the cut-out has now been
    repaired.&rdquo;)</p>
  <p class="western">As for the welding, here was another instance
    where my P.G. training paid off. We had, of course, immediately
    wired the Bureau for permission to proceed with repairs, outlining
    our intentions in detail, but our schedule was such that the
    deadline for beginning repairs came and went without any word from
    the Bureau. So we simply proceeded according to my submitted plan.
    It turns out that on a field trip to the Naval Experimental Station
    (across the Severn from USNA) we had been treated to a presentation
    by Bela Ronay, then acclaimed as the world&rsquo;s foremost
    authority on welding. As he spoke, I (alone) copied down into my
    notebook an entire table of welding instructions anent high-quality
    steel. There were columns for thickness of subject plate, diameter
    of electrodes to be used, polarity to be used, and amperage to be
    used, etc. Ronay saw me copying it and admonished, &ldquo;Son, those
    recommendations haven&rsquo;t been approved for publication by the
    Bureau yet.&rdquo; Fortunately, I had by then just completed my
    transcription. As of the start of our repairs, the specifications I
    copied down that day so long ago still hadn&rsquo;t been approved
    and published by the Bureau, but I had them, and we followed them!
    We completed the repairs, tested them OK, and were off and safely
    down the Columbia River on schedule, and with all four main engines.</p>
  <p class="western">Once clear of the harbor, I (who had not only
    been without sleep for over 48 hours, but had even taken my meals in
    the engine room) collapsed on my bunk. Almost immediately I was
    awakened by the thumping of the Captain&rsquo;s Marine orderly on my
    stateroom door. &ldquo;The Captain respectfully requests you to
    report to the bridge, sir!&rdquo; I shouted back, &ldquo;And I
    respectfully tell the Captain to go to hell! I haven&rsquo;t slept
    for three days.&rdquo; (One is reminded of Lindbergh&rsquo;s remark,
    &ldquo;There comes a point when the body&rsquo;s demand for sleep is
    harder to endure than any other pain I have encountered.&rdquo;
    One&rsquo;s state becomes one of fearless irrationality, or vice
    versa.) I don&rsquo;t know what that poor Marine told the Skipper,
    but in a few minutes he was back with, &ldquo;Mr. Wright, the
    Skipper sends his apologies and requests that you give him a report
    on the repair operation as soon as you feel sufficiently refreshed.&rdquo;
    Well, we later reported to the Skipper, and then got off a detailed
    report to our Type Commander (ComBatCruPac), my old swearing-in
    officer, now RAdm. Walter S. Delaney. Shortly, his commendation was
    entered into my record for &ldquo;soundness of decisions,&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;initiative displayed in directing emergency engineering
    repairs.&rdquo; Well, at least I sometimes did something right.</p>
  <p class="western">By Nov 1946, in time for a dandy Thanksgiving
    dinner at a &ldquo;big-family&rdquo; neighbor&rsquo;s house,
    Kathleen, George and I were together again, this time at Sunset
    Beach on the Hood Canal. And it was here that we finally got to
    enjoy a Christmas together at last. Soon we were into 1947. This was
    the year TV was really born, the Department of Defense was formed,
    and Richmond, Virginia, finally opened its public libraries to
    blacks for the first time! In February I got my first fitness report
    from later-Admiral Ruthven E. Libby, who subsequently served as a
    Chief Allied Negotiator at Panmunjom, Korea. This time I got 17 of
    19 ratings in the top 10%, with the other two being &ldquo;unobserved.&rdquo;
    By then the factor of performance in battle had been changed to
    performance at battle stations. My overall evaluation ran thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">LCdr. Wright is an excellent officer of the
    <i>highest</i> personal and military character whose performance of
    duty has in <i>all</i> respects been <i>very</i> satisfactory. His
    knowledge of engineering is comprehensive (who would have believed
    it?), and his department is administered in a <i>very</i> capable
    and efficient manner. <i>All</i> of his work is accomplished
    expeditiously and efficiently; the engineering efficiency of this
    ship has improved <i>rapidly</i> and <i>steadily</i> since he took
    over the plant. He is <i>strongly</i> recommended for promotion when
    due. [I think Admiral Libby must have liked me. Quite
    understandably, of course.]</p>

    Hood Canal &ndash; Sunset Beach &ndash; Union, Washington</h3>
  <p class="western">I have already recounted the big event of Mar
    1947, the arrival of our first daughter, Anne Kathryn, named after
    her two grandmothers. This development only served to underscore the
    wisdom of opting for a civilian career. The abrupt transition from
    the high-tension tempo of wartime to the Mickey-Mouse make-work of
    peacetime had had a debilitating effect on me, and this was greatly
    magnified in my mind by a realization that, with the
    almost-concurrent advent of atomic weapons, the forces of which I
    continued to be a part became almost instantly archaic.</p>

    Anne&rsquo;s birthplace &ndash; Hood Canal</h3>
  <p class="western">Consider too, that George was then only barely
    over two years old and already he had flown cross-country and had
    lived in ten houses due to the exigencies of my military service.
    And now we had two children, and hoped for many more. The service
    therefore didn&rsquo;t strike me as providing the most viable
    family-raising environment. So it was that (almost concurrent with
    the expiration of the draft on 31 May 47) I initiated my first
    resignation from the naval service on 29 Mar 1947. My
    slightly-over-one-page-letter request included the following
    representation of my feelings in the matter:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The precise reason for the submission of
    this resignation is the unequivocal realization that this applicant
    is not temperamentally suited for a life dedicated to service in a
    profession which must of necessity abnormally infringe upon personal
    liberty and the otherwise inherent right to a settled,
    unencroachable homelife. Moreover, the repugnant rules and
    regulations, together with the cumbersome customs and traditions
    that govern life in the Navy, tend to stifle imagination,
    initiative, and interest. While the foregoing reasons comprise my
    primary objections, it is also desirable to disclose, as elements
    contributing to my disinclination toward a naval career, certain
    specific interests favored by a civilian status. These interests
    include a wife, two children, and an active civilian professional
    interest (pursuit of the law) manifestly rejected by the Navy.
    Admitting that such interests are of little concern to the Navy,
    still it must be recognized that the consequential predilection for
    civilian life must inevitably operate to the prejudice of any
    service interests.</p>
  <p class="western">You must understand that it was then damn
    difficult for a regular to get out of the service. The over-rapid
    demobilization had stripped all branches of the service of qualified
    personnel, and virtually every operating unit was already seriously
    undermanned. Moreover, you may recall that, incident to postgraduate
    instruction in machinery design, I had signed an agreement to serve,
    as a minimum, through 23 Dec 1947. I attempted to meet this head on
    by requesting a waiver, thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">It is to be noted first that this promise
    was prompted by the fact that, the United States then being in a
    state of war, any declaration of a desire to resign would tend to
    discredit one&rsquo;s due respect, courage, patriotism, and personal
    honor. Further, such agreement was undoubtedly motivated by a
    consideration of the best interests of the service, which
    consideration is patently incompatible with the lack of zeal
    evidenced by the very fact of this resignation.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, at best you might say, &ldquo;Nice try!&rdquo;
    At worst, you might charitably muse, &ldquo;Bull Feathers!&rdquo; In
    any event the Navy denied my request out of hand, and trenchantly
    noted, &ldquo;If you desire, you may, <i>in Dec 1947</i>, resubmit
    your request for acceptance of resignation for reconsideration.&rdquo;
    End of exercise.</p>
  <p class="western">In the early summer of 1947 it became expedient
    to relocate Kathleen, George, and Anne to the Kirk residence at 1404
    Otis Street in Washington, D.C. I was underway more than I was in
    port, and when I was in port I was working virtually around the
    clock, to decommission ships with an almost pitiful insufficiency of
    men and against ludicrous deadlines. Besides, by then we were
    committed to getting out of the service in December. Also, Grandpa
    Kirk was due to visit Seattle on a business trip and could accompany
    Kathleen and the children on the way home. So, it just seemed like
    the proper time to begin the move. This would enable my proceeding
    to DC with the utmost dispatch once I&rsquo;d secured my freedom.
    This move to DC was essentially a &ldquo;people&rdquo; move, since
    our entire worldly goods (&ldquo;household effects&rdquo;), as
    evidenced by our reimbursement voucher for the move from Vallejo to
    Bremerton, reflected the princely charge of $60.07. We all traveled
    light in those days.</p>
  <p class="western">So, I was once again alone, and on occasion I was
    even completely out of touch with my family as we frequently
    ventured to sea for training cruises. I vividly recall an incident
    from one of these cruises which, I&rsquo;ve always felt, revealed an
    inadequacy of common sense and concern on my part. It should be
    included here if only to dramatize that I, too, was not always on
    top of things. We had a fire one day in our forward emergency diesel
    generator space. This is a small compartment in the bowels of the
    ship (housing only the diesel generator and its associated
    switchboard), which can only be entered via a watertight trunk that
    traverses several hatched decks. When I arrived on the scene, smoke
    was emanating from the trunk, and I got busy helping equip a
    fire-and-rescue-party engineer with his rescue breathing apparatus
    (RBA) so he could descend into the space to investigate the
    situation. We were still fiddling around when the Skipper arrived on
    the scene. &ldquo;Is anybody trapped down there?&rdquo; he asked
    excitedly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to find out,
    Sir,&rdquo; I replied. Forthwith the Old Man was off and descending
    the trunk through the smoke. Well, nobody <i>was</i> down there, the
    problem was minor, and all fire and smoke ceased with the
    de-energizing of the forward emergency switchboard by remote control
    from the main electrical switchboard. I didn&rsquo;t miss the point,
    however, of the <i>Old Man&rsquo;s</i> example. My alertness and
    initiative had apparently been on hold. I don&rsquo;t think (?) it
    was a question of courage. It bothered me that the Skipper&rsquo;s
    concern and course of action hadn&rsquo;t even occurred to me. Once
    again, John D. MacDonald captures my thought best: &ldquo;I think
    the closest we get to awareness is when we see one man, under
    stress, react &hellip; in a noble, a selfless way.&rdquo; Amen. <i>Well
      Done</i>, Captain M. N. Little, USN!</p>
  <p class="western">I would like to say that I learned a lesson, but
    apparently I didn&rsquo;t. There was another incident of which I&rsquo;m
    less than proud, and in fairness to accuracy it belongs in this
    record. It occurred in early 1948 when I was decommissioning
    Bremerton just prior to my own decommissioning. One of the most
    tedious and repugnant chores incident to &ldquo;moth-balling&rdquo;
    a ship was the purification of the inner surfaces of all grimy fuel
    oil tanks down to clean metal. This thoroughly obnoxious and
    back-breaking labor required the major share of our limited
    personnel resources. To expedite this tremendous job, the use of
    powerful solvents was introduced. Now fuel oil tanks not only don&rsquo;t
    have any windows, they are exceedingly cramped, tortuous in their
    full utilization of every available nook and cranny of space, and
    are honeycombed with obstructing but perforated &ldquo;swash
    plates.&rdquo; They are dark, cold, and totally unventilated. Well,
    you can already sense the dimensions of the problems involved, and
    the inherent danger to personnel safety.</p>
  <p class="western">So, despite the precautions of a permanent sentry
    at the entrance to each tank (to maintain constant communication
    with those working inside the tanks), and a vast network of
    jury-rigged portable ventilating fans with canvas pipes trunking
    fresh air to each working station, one day one of my men passed out
    and was hustled topside. To my everlasting shame, rather than
    concern for the welfare of this poor sailor, my #1 interest at the
    scene was shielding it from the Skipper, lest he terminate the use
    of the solvent that had been our salvation in meeting the outrageous
    deadlines. My reaction in this situation distresses me to this very
    day as well it should. Fortunately, my men had the good sense to
    prevail, and refused to enter the tanks thereafter unless the use of
    the solvent was discontinued. Now, I <i>am</i> deeply ashamed of my
    part in this, but I hope this recitation might contribute to a
    better understanding of how (as at My Lai) people under pressure can
    sometimes do some damn stupid things. As the saying goes, &ldquo;You
    really had to be there,&rdquo; and some degree of tolerance is in
    order for those &ldquo;carrying the sack&rdquo; from those who never
    have had the pleasure.</p>
  <p class="western">On 15 Aug 1947 Hindu India and Moslem Pakistan
    were granted their independence, even as I made another move for
    mine by initiating a request for duty in Washington. D.C. I
    predicated my case on the fact that the Navy Department had
    previously conceded my eligibility to resign effective in Dec of
    1947, and pointed out that I would at that time have 60 days
    accredited leave (which one traditionally took prior to separation,
    and therefore I&rsquo;d then be in the DC area in any event). I
    further noted that a relief for me would in any case soon have to be
    provided. I also stressed my previously acknowledged qualification
    for the quasi-engineering billet I requested. My C.O. appended a
    strong endorsement, thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Forwarded recommending approval&hellip; It
    is believed LCdr. Wright is well qualified for the duty which he
    seeks. He has had more than 5 years operational and engineering
    experience afloat in major combatant vessels, has completed the
    correspondence course in engineering formerly conducted by the Post
    Graduate School at Annapolis, and has also completed the resident
    postgraduate course in Naval Engineering (Design). He has likewise
    received certificates of satisfactory completion of three USAFI
    courses in business law and is currently pursuing a pre-bar course
    in common law. He has been a registered law student in the State of
    Virginia for more than a year, and will be eligible for admission to
    the bar in that state in Jul 1948. LCdr. Wright&rsquo;s
    administrative and planning ability has been favorably commented on
    in correspondence from CTF-77, INSURVPAC, &amp; COMBATCRUPAC.
    [Clearly, I&rsquo;d been doing something right, and also making good
    use of my time!] His performance of duty aboard this vessel, both in
    administration of his department and as to maintenance and operation
    of the material under his cognizance has been very satisfactory.</p>
  <p class="western">The foregoing request, too, was in due course
    rejected due to &ldquo;the short period of time&rdquo; I&rsquo;d be
    on such duty if granted. My fitness report for this period
    concluding in Aug of 1947 reveals my then-somewhat-deteriorating
    state of dedication. Oh, sure! It incorporated some nice things,
    thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">LCdr. Wright is an excellent officer,
    especially well-qualified in engineering duties, of superior
    personal and good military character, who has performed his duties
    in a highly satisfactory manner. His department is capably and
    efficiently administered. He possesses an <i>outstanding</i>
    knowledge [get that!] of engineering and could be a valuable asset
    to any command in these duties. He is thorough, dependable, and can
    be relied upon to make prompt and accurate decisions.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, I don&rsquo;t know about that last
    statement, and in any event, the tip-off re my declining morale was
    that I was (in lieu of my previous 100% score) found within the top
    10% on only four of the 19 rating factors! A contributing factor to
    my less-than-enthusiastic attitude was the rather pedestrian nature
    of our operational assignments during the previous six months
    covered by this performance rating. We participated in refresher
    training, inter-ship and type training, a west coast Reserve cruise,
    and underwent a 90-day ship overhaul. None of this is very exciting
    stuff. Moreover, my family was now on the east coast.</p>
  <p class="western">My melancholia must have peaked on our 5th
    wedding anniversary, since I initiated my second tender of
    resignation from the naval service on 14 Sep 1947. It was a short,
    succinct one-page request in which I merely stated that, &ldquo;The
    precise reasons for this request are as listed in my original
    resignation dated 29 Mar 1947, and asked for the earliest
    practicable termination date.&rdquo; My C.O. simply endorsed it with
    one word: &ldquo;Forwarded.&rdquo; The reason for initiating this
    particular request was that the timing of my impending separation
    from the service was fast becoming a critical matter, thus I wrote:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">It is requested that my orders to temporary
    duty in connection with separation processing be effected in Dec
    1947, such that the aforesaid temporary duty shall terminate in my
    effective date of resignation on or about 23 Dec 1947. The aforesaid
    date is coincidentally that on which my agreement not to resign
    expires; and is compatible with the recognition by the Bureau of the
    pending lapse of necessity for my services, as expressed in
    reference (a).</p>
  <p class="western">The latter was the Bureau of Naval Personnel&rsquo;s
    denial of my request for assignment to duty in the Washington, D.C.,
    area. In it the Bureau stated that, &ldquo;It is regretted that
    favorable action cannot be taken on your request <i>because the
      short period of time you would be on duty</i> with the Materiel
    Division would not warrant such a change.&rdquo; Clearly, I was
    trying desperately to force the issue by convicting them, as it
    were, by words out of their own mouth. My ploy failed. This request,
    too, was denied. Still, as Alexander Pope has lyricized, &ldquo;Hope
    springs eternal in the human breast.&rdquo; So it was that I tried
    yet another ploy. On 11 Oct 1947 I initiated another
    assignment-to-duty request, this time seeking placement in the
    Office of the Judge Advocate General (the Navy&rsquo;s #1 lawyer) in
    Washington. This letter warrants quoting, in part, since it
    elaborates the critical nature of the timing involved, to the
    benefit of both me and the Navy:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">In substantiation of my qualifications for
    such assignment attention is respectfully invited to &hellip; [my
    denied earlier application for legal training under Navy auspices]
    and my Commanding Officer&rsquo;s endorsement thereon representing
    me as excellently suited for such instruction. Within a month of
    receipt of the Bureau&rsquo;s rejection of my application I
    officially registered as a law student in the State of Virginia,
    coincident with enrolling in the pre-bar law course of the La Salle
    Extension University of Chicago. Under this arrangement I have now
    been pursuing the study of law on my own time and at my own expense
    for about a year and a half.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">In accordance with rule three of the Rules
    of Virginia Board of Law Examiners, however, <i>official residence
      in the State of Virginia for at least seven months immediately prior
      to examination for admission to the bar is required.</i> This
    request is submitted to enable me to gain admission to the bar, and
    thus become fully qualified for legal duty in the Navy. It should be
    noted that this request is consistent with previous requests for
    acceptance of resignation, and requests for assignment in
    quasi-legal billets in the Materiel Section; all of which have been
    rejected. The latter requests were initiated on the premise that
    rejection for legal training quite possibly was based on the fact
    that the applicant previously had had advanced training in another
    field at the expense of the Navy.</p>
  <p class="western">This time my CO forwarded my request,
    recommending approval, and additionally noted that, &ldquo;the
    Commanding Officer is not qualified to judge LCdr. Wright&rsquo;s
    legal ability. LCdr. Wright, however, is <i>painstaking, thorough
      and industrious</i> [and he might have added <i>persistent</i>] to
    an unusual degree and it is believed that with the opportunity to
    devote himself to legal work during working hours as well as to the
    study of law in his spare time, he will soon overcome any deficiency
    in his legal knowledge.&rdquo; Now that was really nice, and I
    concede this fully supplanted any overdue medal for saving this
    skipper from sliding our cruiser into second base at Padre&rsquo;s
    Field in San Diego. Alas, I had forgotten that Alexander Pope had
    also said, &ldquo;For fools rush in where angels fear to tread.&rdquo;
    Yes, this request was also denied, on the basis of the limited quota
    of officer lawyers authorized for assignment to the Judge Advocate&rsquo;s
    Office. BUT! At the same time, the JAG recommended that my previous
    request for postgraduate training in law be referred to the
    selection board, which will be convened the latter part of this year
    &hellip; in view of his continuing interest in the study of law.</p>
  <p class="western">Eureka! I had finally scored. As a consequence,
    in due course I was actually issued orders for assignment to
    Washington in the quasi-legal billet of executive secretary to the
    U.S. Navy Retirement Board, then headed by Admiral Hoover. But this
    came too late, and I opted out via an urgent and finally successful
    resignation request. I was eventually separated on 2 Apr 1948
    precisely <i>two days too late to qualify by residence for the next
      regularly scheduled Virginia bar exam!</i> So ended my dedicated bid
    for a legal career. Strangely, it only occurred to me as I recorded
    all this that I could have easily established legal Virginia
    residence via domiciling Kathleen, George and Anne there while I was
    yet thousands of miles away. <i>El Stupido</i>!</p>
  <p class="western">So life went on well, after a fashion. It isn&rsquo;t
    much of a life when you&rsquo;re on the west coast and your family
    is on the east coast. Anne was now fast approaching her first
    birthday, and I hadn&rsquo;t seen her since she was barely a month
    old. (At least her siblings will now understand how she got started
    on all her bad habits, being beyond reach of good old Dad&rsquo;s
    disciplinary paws in this most formative year.) As for good old Dad,
    USS Bremerton was secured on the north side of Pier 20 at the
    Embarcadero in San Francisco. Sometimes we were even secured to the
    ground. I remember heading back to the ship from one evening&rsquo;s
    liberty, and noting as I approached that the engineering plant was
    venting via the emergency atmospheric exhaust, rather than
    exhausting to the auxiliary condensers. It seems that with the
    out-running tide the ship merely settled on the bottom, slightly
    listing to one side, and coincidentally blocking off all sea water
    suction for condenser circulating water. This meant the plant was
    then operating on emergency diesel-driven electrical power and that
    engineers were scrambling madly about below decks trying to rectify
    the general engineering chaos. I merely turned on my heel and headed
    to the nearest hotel for the night.</p>

    USS Bremerton, CA-130 &ndash; My last ship, 1948</h3>
  <p class="western">As the ranking engineer officer I would have
    automatically been in charge of restoring order the minute I set
    foot on deck, and might well have been up the rest of the night. I
    chose the happy alternative of a quiet hotel room. Back aboard the
    next morning I contacted Mare Island Naval Shipyard and set about
    arranging their provision of a dockside portable diesel-driven
    emergency fire pump. This was not only to provide the requisite
    plant cooling water in the event of further groundings (which
    thereafter occurred at virtually every low tide), but provided
    essential emergency firemain pressure. When my shipmate Ensign
    Converse was recalled from the reserves during the Korean War, he
    once again visited Pier 20 at the Embarcadero. He dropped me a brief
    note: &ldquo;Chief! You&rsquo;ll be happy to know <i>your</i> fire
    pump is still sitting there on Pier 20.&rdquo; Well, it <i>is</i> my
    fire pump. As far as I can recall, I&rsquo;m still signed out to
    Mare Island as its custodian! Check it out if you&rsquo;re ever in
    San Francisco! Incidentally, now you know why I never opted for the
    Reserves. I could have been right back there with Converse during
    the Korean War! Good grief, Lucy!</p>
  <p class="western">As we close out the year 1947, mention might well
    be made of the special fitness report I received in December
    incident to the detachment of the C.O. I think it encapsulates my
    disposition in those trying times infinitely better than I ever
    could, thus: &ldquo;LCdr. Wright is an excellent engineer officer.
    He is thoroughly competent technically and administers his
    department very well. Beyond that, however, he displays little
    interest in broadening his knowledge of other duties of a line
    officer.&rdquo; (This is not quite accurate, but the CO couldn&rsquo;t
    know otherwise. At the time I was privately studying seamanship
    especially as regards maneuvering multi-engined ships out of simple
    <i>fear</i> I might be called upon to take the conn in such a drill.
    I was also deeply into meteorology, and my archives from this period
    still include one superb article on &ldquo;a weather eye&rdquo;
    culled from <i>Yachtsman</i> magazine.) The Skipper&rsquo;s report
    continues, &ldquo;He does not desire to continue his naval career
    and has explored every avenue by which he might honorably separate
    himself from the service, or if that be impossible, to be assigned
    to shore duty. [Fair enough!] He recently submitted his resignation
    for the second time. LCdr. Wright would probably make an excellent
    Engineering-Duty-Only Officer. He is intelligent, highly
    industrious, and <i>tenacious to the point of stubbornness.</i>
    [Mom! Are you listening, wherever you are?] His whole outlook,
    however, has been affected by his dissatisfaction with his present
    situation and his inability to change it. [Amen!] <i>Despite his
      feelings, however, he has not shirked his duty and his performance
      as an engineer officer has been very satisfactory</i>.&rdquo; As I
    say, I couldn&rsquo;t have said it all better myself. I was
    literally champing at the bit to rejoin my family.</p>
  <p class="western">So it was that we began the year of 1948 still a
    continent apart. This was slightly less than a mere 40 years ago,
    but 1948 marked the first time that our freedom-and-equality-loving
    nation allowed our native American Indians in Arizona and New Mexico
    to vote. On the other hand, we were already mass-producing atomic
    weapons of double the power of the initial 40-kilo blasts unleashed
    on Japan. On 29 Mar 1948 my brother Tom married Aunt Mary. I missed
    the wedding by a mere 4 days! As alluded to earlier, the upcoming
    Virginia bar exam required candidates to be residents of the state
    by 31 Mar. (On 18 Mar 1985 the Supreme Court found such residency
    requirements then in 40 states unconstitutional!) I arrived back in
    the area on 2 Apr. Do I hear Maxwell Smart exclaiming, &ldquo;Mis-s-s-ed
    it by &hellip; <i>that much!</i>&rdquo;? Do I hear Kurt Vonnegut
    sighing, &ldquo;So it goes&hellip;&rdquo;? Needless to say, with
    these two events on my mind I was virtually climbing the walls by
    then. Little wonder, then, that my naval career almost came to grief
    on the rocks and shoals of bitterness at almost the very last
    minute. My final fitness report for the period only hints at the
    problem, thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Except for one tactless outburst of
    criticism of a decision of his Commanding Officer, LCdr. Wright&rsquo;s
    services during this period (12-5-47 to 2-29-48) have been
    excellent. Though his resignation has already been accepted to take
    effect upon the final deactivation of this vessel, he has
    consistently carried out his duties with <i>zeal</i> and
    <i>intelligence</i>. The Navy will lose <i>a valuable officer</i>
    when LCdr. Wright leaves the service.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, the foregoing was <i>not</i>, as a matter
    of fact, the <i>original</i> fitness report covering this period. It
    was, to say the least, a negotiated fitness report. Perhaps the
    complex and highly volatile situation that developed can most
    expeditiously be presented by merely incorporating the relevant
    correspondence bearing dates of 29 Mar to 1 Apr 1948, thus (from my
    letter to the Bureau of Personnel):</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Subject fitness report includes the
    following comment: &ldquo;Except for one tactless outburst of
    criticism of a decision of his Commanding Officer, LCdr. Wright&rsquo;s
    service during this period has been excellent.&rdquo; Since this is
    a mere conclusion devoid of fact it is herewith proposed, per Naval
    Regulations, to delineate the facts in the case, in order that
    proper authorities may better formulate an unbiased opinion that may
    inure to the greater benefit of and justice to all concerned.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Inactivation of the Bremerton commenced in
    Dec 1947, and is presently expected to be completed in early Apr.
    Inactivation places a high premium upon experienced officers,
    particularly technical men. The originator, the Engineer Officer,
    was fortunate in having several highly trained officers in the
    department, among them the Mike Division Officer, Lt.(jg) M. S.
    Dawson, USN. Lt. Dawson attained his present rank via the enlisted
    ratings, which is in itself indicative of his high caliber. He has
    had over 17 years operating engineering experience in the Navy. More
    important, he was, immediately prior to reporting aboard the
    Bremerton, directly involved with inactivation work at the Mare
    Island Yard. His next assignment calls for him to serve as Executive
    Officer. It was the Commanding Officer&rsquo;s categoric decision to
    bar this highly trained officer at a critical period during
    inactivation from any further employment aboard ship to which the
    Engineer Officer took calm but decisive exception.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The Commanding Officer emphasized that such
    radical action was occasioned by his recognition of a completely
    unacceptable attitude and impliedly general incompetence in Lt.
    Dawson. He then went to great length to disclose the primary factors
    contributing to his decision: (a) One of Lt. Dawson&rsquo;s men was
    discovered using power rather than hand tools to clean (not polish)
    floor plates in preparation for painting same. The Commanding
    Officer thereupon reiterated the not so obvious dogma that hand
    tools should be used for such purpose <i>in the interest of saving
      time</i>. The result: whereas the individual concerned had completed
    20 plates by power tools in a half-day, he than was able, with one
    man assisting, to complete 20 plates in a full day. Lt. Dawson was
    censured for his poor judgment and improper supervision. (b) During
    a routine inspection of machinery spaces the Commanding Officer
    declared that the inactivation of a particular engine room could
    well be accomplished in ten to fourteen days. Lt. Dawson ventured an
    opinion that it would take approximately twice that long even if the
    number of men available to him were doubled. The CPO in charge of
    the engine room supported Lt. Dawson&rsquo;s contention. This
    incident directly resulted in Lt. Dawson and the CPO being barred
    from the engine rooms for the duration of inactivation. The CPO
    involved was CMM C. E. Finch, USN, who served most creditably during
    the war in Warrant Officer rank. <i>It should further be noted that
      the actual inactivation of the engine room required more man-days
      than even Lt. Dawson allotted</i>.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The Engineer Officer, upon being confronted
    with this enigma, proceeded according to Naval Regulations, which
    set forth his duty to submit written suggestions regarding
    prospective improvement in the administration of his department; and
    Naval Regulations, wherein it is stipulated as the absolute duty of
    a department head to communicate his views to the Commanding Officer
    when deemed in the best interest of the department or the naval
    service. Accordingly, a written memorandum to the Commanding Officer
    was initiated by the Engineer Officer, outlining the essential
    nature of Lt. Dawson&rsquo;s services during inactivation. The
    Commanding Officer chose to reply to this memorandum in the course
    of a head of department conference. The Commanding Officer
    emphasized the urgency of the request made by the Engineer Officer,
    and then declared that he nevertheless vigorously over-ruled the
    request on principle; and that Lt. Dawson would thereafter be
    employed ashore as a Barracks Officer. He made his point clear by
    saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a man like that aboard my ship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The Engineer Officer then proceeded
    according to Naval Regulations, wherein the right of an officer to
    appeal to the ISIC is preserved. (Further basis for being wary of
    unreasonable perversity may be readily inferred from a review of the
    record in the Summary Court Martial case of G. E. Clinton, Coxswain,
    USN, wherein the Engineer Officer, acting as defense counsel,
    objected to certain irrelevant and highly prejudicial testimony of
    the Commanding Officer as a prosecution witness, and was upheld by
    the court.) Upon the Commanding Officer delivering his ultimatum
    barring Lt. Dawson from further Engineering Department employment
    the Engineer Officer said, &ldquo;Captain, I propose to submit this
    to Commodore Ray, as it is the most ridiculous thing I&rsquo;ve ever
    encountered.&rdquo; This statement was delivered calmly, evenly, and
    as respectfully as circumstances would permit; although its impact
    upon the Commanding Officer cannot for a moment be doubted. All
    other officers present were immediately dismissed.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The Commanding Officer then <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">contended</font></font>
    that the Engineer Officer&rsquo;s position was indefensible. It was
    then pointed out that the Commanding Officer was only recently in
    receipt of a BuPers dispatch requesting information as to
    availability of the Engineer Officer for immediate detachment, and
    he had replied that retention was essential and in conformance with
    Naval Regulations. It was then explained that the Engineer Officer
    was similarly empowered, by Naval Regulations, to designate for
    retention his key personnel. Further, it was reasoned that as Mike
    Division Officer, Lt. Dawson was most familiar with all main
    machinery plant spare parts and equipage which had yet to be
    identified, inventoried, and preserved. None of this information was
    new, having previously been elaborated upon in the aforementioned
    written memorandum to the Commanding Officer. However, the
    Commanding Officer thereupon modified his demand, and required only
    that Lt. Dawson stay out of the engine rooms.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Recognizing what a complete change of face
    this constituted for the Commanding Officer, and in view of the fact
    that the Commanding Officer had unequivocally denounced Lt. Dawson
    publicly before all department heads, the Engineer Officer (fully
    aware of the dangerous implications of the Commanding Officer&rsquo;s
    reversal, and their inherent potential for promoting disrespect)
    volunteered to inform all officers who had been present of an
    apology to the Captain for so directly taking exception to the
    latter&rsquo;s opinion. This is mentioned merely to preclude the
    apology being misconstrued.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Lt. Dawson had previously very
    satisfactorily inactivated all the engine room machinery, and has
    further contributed to the overall inactivation effort since this
    event by inventorying and preserving all engineering spare parts;
    and by assisting in the preparation of engineering records.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">It is respectfully submitted that the
    Engineer Officer proceeded soundly, and in the best interest of the
    ship. Also, it is believed that the Commanding Officer&rsquo;s
    modification of orders reflects a more mature evaluation of the
    logic of the Engineer Officer&rsquo;s position. This contention is
    reinforced by the great reluctance of the Commanding Officer to show
    the Engineer Officer this fitness report. It was delivered to the
    latter by the Ship&rsquo;s Secretary, with the stipulation that it
    be signed without being read. On noticing that the report on its
    face purported that the Engineer Officer had seen it, the latter
    refused to sign it. The Executive Officer then requested that it be
    signed, saying that the Commanding Officer would personally disclose
    it to me later. Again signature was refused. The Commanding Officer
    then sent for the Engineer Officer, offered the report for
    inspection, and disclaimed any knowledge of requiring the same to be
    signed without being read.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Attention is also invited to the fact that
    while the originator is within the top 10% bracket on the majority
    of all items in each category of military aptitudes, he is
    nevertheless recommended for promotion only if 30% are promoted.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Every statement made herein is subject to
    confirmation by others than myself.</p>
  <p class="western">Of course, the C.O. got in his licks also, thus
    (from the C.O.&rsquo;s endorsement of my foregoing letter):</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Based on my twenty-nine years of naval
    service, it is my opinion that LCdr. Wright deserved disciplinary
    action for his disrespectful remarks. Such action was not taken on
    account of the special condition of LCdr. Wright&rsquo;s continuing
    to serve after his resignation had been submitted and accepted to
    become effective upon inactivation of this vessel. Also, immediately
    afterwards he said his action was ill-considered, or words to that
    effect. I had no intention other than to show the fitness report to
    LCdr. Wright. His remarks in this paragraph are considered
    indicative of his quick resentment over imagined grievances. I must
    candidly state that I would not want him under my command in the
    future on account of his hair trigger resentment, and resultant
    disrespectful behavior.</p>
  <p class="western">It is interesting to note, as I conclude
    testimony on this incident, that in my final fitness report, upon 1
    Apr 1948 detachment for separation from the naval service, this same
    C.O. nonetheless brought himself to state that my performance of
    duty during the period of this report (3-1-48 to 4-1-48) has been
    <i>very</i> satisfactory. So, I suppose, all&rsquo;s well that ends
    well, and I leave to my readers (if there be more than one!) to draw
    their own conclusions as to who was on the side of right reason. Of
    course, from a backward perspective of some 35-plus years, all of
    this might seem like so much ado about nothing. I can only assure
    you that at the time this was mighty serious business. And, you&rsquo;ll
    have to admit I kept my Yeoman (clerk-typist) busy!</p>
  <p class="western">In fact, my last Yeoman merits a special
    accolade. Brutus was his name, and he not only hardly ever went on
    liberty, he could usually be found typing away no matter the hour of
    day or night that I might pop into my Logroom office. He never had
    to be coddled or coaxed to get a job done. I mention this because
    the shift from male Yeoman to female typists was one of the hardest
    adjustments I had to make (if, indeed, I ever did make it) on
    transitioning to a civilian office. Somewhere in <i>Beau Geste</i>
    author Percival Christopher Wren has a character observe that he had
    discovered that &ldquo;One could call an American almost anything,
    so long as one smiled.&rdquo; True enough if the phrase be applied
    only to males. I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for the kid-gloves approach
    with which women in the office expected to be treated. I&rsquo;m
    afraid I became famous (infamous?) for the number of my secretaries
    who were found crying in the ladies&rsquo; room. &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s
    lib&rdquo; or not, they just couldn&rsquo;t be bawled at like

    Yeoman Brutus &ndash; 3 December 1948</h3>
  <p class="western">Continuing with our mighty saga, and unmentioned
    so far, was a truly scurrilous fitness report presented for my
    signature at this time anent which I really raised hell. I was even
    presented a fictitious alternative and fairly reasonable report for
    signature, to which the original signature page had been appended,
    so that the offensive covering sheets might later be easily
    substituted. (I&rsquo;m telling you this Skipper was as paranoid as
    Captain Queeg and Mr. Robert&rsquo;s Skipper all rolled into one!)
    As I set about concocting my rebuttal to this sorry business, the
    Skipper withdrew the report, and went so far as to say that I must
    have imagined it &ndash; that the pressure of my situation had me
    hallucinating! The only problem with this was that I had shared the
    report with my officers and CPOs, and in fact one of my Chiefs had
    taken it ashore to have a copy made for me by some new-fangled
    <i>Haloid</i> duplicating process that was to become <i>XEROX</i>.
    It was only when I confronted the dumbfounded Skipper with this that
    he relented and withdrew to a position with which we both could
    live. Talk about fun and games!</p>
  <p class="western">Little wonder, then, why I was happy to become
    free at last on 2 Apr 1948 &ndash; a 100% civilian. I refused to
    wear blue for several years after my separation. All my early
    civilian suits and slacks were brown. And I wanted nothing to do
    with working for naval officers as a civilian in the Department of
    the Navy. This latter was short-sighted, of course, as my naval
    experience was the only exploitable experience I had. This
    reactionary attitude does, however, account for the Apr to Sep
    period of unemployment that ensued.</p>

    Last picture in <i>Blue and Gold</i></h3>
  <p class="western">Before launching a recital of my civilian career,
    however, let&rsquo;s briefly sum up the 12-year naval career
    spanning from 10 Aug 1936 to 2 Apr 1948. I saw service afloat in the
    battleships <i>USS Wyoming</i> and <i>USS New York</i>, the
    destroyer <i>USS J. Fred Talbot</i>, the light cruiser <i>USS
      Amsterdam</i>, and the heavy cruisers <i>USS Tuscaloosa</i> and <i>USS
      Bremerton</i>. I rose in rank from Midshipman 4th class, the lowly
    plebe, to Lieutenant Commander, serving ultimately as a Head of
    Department of a major combatant vessel in time of war &ndash; the
    Chief Engineer. My service spanned the northern hemisphere of the
    globe, from Murmansk in the east to Shanghai in the west. I crossed
    the Arctic Circle and the International Dateline. My zeal for the
    service peaked in <i>Tuscaloosa</i> and plunged to its nadir in my
    final days in <i>USS Bremerton</i>. My official awards are as
    follows:</p>
  <p class="poem-western">American Defense Service Medal<br/>
    American
    Campaign Medal<br/>
    Asiatic-Pacific Campaign
    Medal<br/>
    European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal<br/>
    World
    War II Victory Medal</p>
  <p class="western">Operational stars were awarded for affixing to
    the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal for participation
    in the <i>Operation Torch</i> landing at Casablanca. (Unfortunately,
    I never got ashore to look up Humphrey and Ingrid.) Another
    operational star was awarded for affixing to the Asiatic-Pacific
    Campaign Medal for participation in the final 3rd Fleet assault on
    the Japanese home islands. All in all, a rather prosaic record for
    such a violent four-year war. But, remember, I spent
    one-and-one-half years, right in the bloody middle of the war,
    safely ensconced at P.G. School in unthreatened West Annapolis. In
    any event, my awards testify that I was not only <i>there</i>, I was
    <i>everywhere</i>! And, above all, I offer no apologies &ndash; I&rsquo;m
    damn happy to be here NOW!</p>

  <p class="western">One very important postscript covering this
    period is in order. Mention must be made of the service award that
    should have been forthcoming to Kathleen. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve
    seen many an old WWII war movie, or even a post-war movie about any
    of the armed services in which a service wife has been portrayed
    (too often with good reason) as being about as useful as something
    between a fifth wheel and an anchor. In our years in the service we
    met many a neurotic shrew whose whole purpose in life seemed to be
    to bitch about how her husband&rsquo;s service career screwed her
    up, held her down, or just plain kept her spinning her wheels.
    Happily, Kathleen had absolutely nothing in common with these wimpy
    albatrosses. She would pick up on a minute&rsquo;s notice and bus to
    Norfolk, train to Boston, or fly cross-country to Seattle or San
    Diego with or without small children. She could buy and sell cars,
    lease houses, switch banks coast-to-coast, or whatever else was
    compelled by the situation. More than this, <i>I&rsquo;m STILL
      waiting to hear her FIRST murmur of complaint!</i> So, <i>WELL DONE</i>,
    Kathleen! Consider yourself the first recipient of the Jack Wright
    Memorial <i>OUTSTANDING SERVICE WIFE AWARD</i>!</p>

      XIII. DESIGN</h2>
  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western">Just to carve out a living, is holy
    work&hellip; In doing and creating, the human being becomes more and
    more God-like.<span style="font-style: normal"> &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Irving&nbsp;Greenberg</span></p>
  <p class="western">I was separated from the naval service at the
    Naval Station, Treasure Island, which is reached from an exit at
    about the midpoint of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. My
    flying trip home was via the classic three-rudder <i>Constellation</i>,
    which required close to nine hours for the trip plus a three-hour
    time change. That made the homecoming a long day indeed, and we
    arrived in Washington well after dark. Somebody with a car bearing
    Kathleen and George met me at the airport. After a year with
    strictly adult male associates, I couldn&rsquo;t get over George&rsquo;s
    high pitched voice. I can remember asking (as he exclaimed over the
    big needle as we drove past the Washington monument) if he always
    spoke in such a high, squeaky voice.</p>
  <p class="western">As usual, I traveled with little more trappings
    than what I was wearing and carrying in my pockets. I was &ldquo;traveling
    light,&rdquo; as the old song by Billie Holiday goes. All my gear
    <i>and then some</i> arrived later via my cruise box, which was a
    beautiful custom-crafted piece of art fashioned with special care as
    a tribute from my enlisted men. Now, that <i>WAS</i> heavy! This was
    due in no small measure to the &ldquo;and then some&rdquo;
    referenced above. It seems that my Black Gang had loaded it with the
    fullest set of tools you could ever imagine &ndash; all manner of
    flat and round files, open-end wrench sets, box wrench sets,
    ball-peen and claw hammers, regular and Phillips-head screw drivers,
    punches, chisels, mauls &ndash; you name it<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote50anc" href="#sdendnote50sym"><sup>50</sup></a>.
    As Ed McMahon might say to Johnny Carson, &ldquo;EV-er-y TOOL you
    could EVER WANT was IN THAT BOX!&rdquo; (Later I went to confession
    about these ill-gotten gains to a good old priest in downtown St.
    Dominic&rsquo;s parish. &ldquo;Did you also serve in the Navy during
    the war?,&rdquo; the good father asked. &ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; I
    replied. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll bet you worked some crazy hours. I
    mean, it wasn&rsquo;t any 9-to-5 job, right?,&rdquo; he went on.
    &ldquo;No, father, it was sort of on-call 24-hours-a-day duty,&rdquo;
    I responded. &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;And
    considering you didn&rsquo;t even know you had the stuff, just
    consider it <i>a fringe benefit</i> and forget about it.&rdquo; How
    about that? I don&rsquo;t know, but I think they just don&rsquo;t
    make priests like that anymore.)</p>
  <p class="western">Besides job-hunting and house-hunting (which
    latter action was, of course, contingent upon success in the
    former), I had to spend a lot of time churning through the red tape
    which tied up my considerable veteran&rsquo;s benefits. Several days
    were spent wading through the maze that goes under the euphemism of
    <i>Veterans Administration</i>, securing the necessary vouchers for
    GI loans, GI unemployment benefits, and GI educational benefits. I
    received just about the maximum home loan and unemployment benefits,
    but used very little of the educational benefits. The sad fact was,
    I couldn&rsquo;t afford the time for the extensive free education
    allotments that I had coming. I had to get a job! That was so
    critical that all thought of my considerable investment in a legal
    career in Virginia immediately went by the board. I just couldn&rsquo;t
    wait out the additional year now needed to meet legal residential
    requirements. So, the only so-called educational benefit of which I
    could avail myself was submission to a day-long battery of aptitude
    tests then conducted by the Catholic University Psychology
    Department (under VA auspices) to determine my most likely
    employment fields. My Wechsler-Bellevue (adult IQ) was 123 (124
    verbal, 114 performance) stipulated as &ldquo;superior&rdquo;; my
    law aptitude was 65 percentile (&ldquo;above average&rdquo;); my
    coop. English aptitude was 92 percentile (&ldquo;superior&rdquo;);
    my Bell Adjustment (home, health, social, emotional) was rated
    &ldquo;average overall adjustment&rdquo;; and my Kuder Preference
    test indicated major fields of interest to be &ldquo;literary,
    computational, clerical&rdquo; &ndash; not altogether flattering.
    Worse than that, a special engineering aptitude test concocted by
    Chrysler Corporation (and which really comprised three separate
    tests) was more or less a disaster. The first part was the Ohio
    State Psychological Test designed to test &ldquo;comprehension,&rdquo;
    and I rated in the 82nd percentile, which was deemed &ldquo;very
    excellent.&rdquo; The third part was a Personality Inventory Test,
    which allegedly evaluated my &ldquo;temperament.&rdquo; The only
    report I received was that my scores were &ldquo;on an adult level.&rdquo;
    The middle test, the Big One, was a Mechanical Comprehension Test
    designed to measure mechanical aptitude of prospective engineers. <i>I
      scored in the 7th percentile!</i> That&rsquo;s right, folks, the <i>7th
      percentile</i>! &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; the summary
    report admonished, &ldquo;Many graduate engineers, such as yourself,
    have done worse than this.&rdquo; (Well, at the 7th percentile
    &ldquo;many&rdquo; couldn&rsquo;t have been a helluva lot!) &ldquo;Almost
    everyone who takes this test,&rdquo; the report went on, &ldquo;makes
    it much harder than it is.&rdquo; Well, I think there <i>was</i>
    something to that. No questions were allowed, of course, all tests
    being conducted in absolute silence. I recall that almost every
    question had a simple answer but I was forever asking myself, &ldquo;Do
    they mean neglecting wind resistance? or neglecting friction?&rdquo;
    and things like that. My problem here, I guess, was a matter of too
    much education. Still, there it was &ndash; as an engineering
    prospect I ranked in the 7th percentile! Naturally I became an
    engineer!</p>
  <p class="western">So, now back to the job hunt. The headlines
    heralded the horrors of the Berlin blockade and of atomic bombs,
    even as the entertainment world proclaimed that &ldquo;The greatest
    thing you&rsquo;ll ever learn is to love and be loved in return,&rdquo;
    and the highly publicized Kinsey Report was vividly extolling the
    sexual habits of the American male. But you can&rsquo;t live on
    love, and 15 million job seekers preceded me in my transition from
    military service to the civilian job market. The Berlin blockade
    (which led to the almost two-and-one-half-million-ton airlift of
    food, fuel, and medical supplies between 24 Jun 1948 and 17 May
    1949) began on l Apr 1948. The seeming blockade of my job
    aspirations began on 2 Apr 1948, and continued until 21 Sep 1948 &ndash;
    virtually a half-year of unemployment.</p>
  <p class="western">This unhappy plight was complicated by our having
    to live with my in-laws in the interim &ndash; and we already having
    two small children and soon expecting a third. After all, Washington
    is essentially a government town, and this was an election year. You
    can set your calendar by the hiring freeze that traditionally marks
    election years, as the pols strive mightily to produce quotable
    reductions in the size of the government for use on the campaign
    trail.</p>
  <p class="western">The Marshall Plan (which was to send some 80
    billion dollars to Europe by 1981) began 14 Apr 1948, but it didn&rsquo;t
    help me. I actually became a welfare recipient, drawing some
    stipulated minimum for unemployed veterans, which was guaranteed for
    some specified period ($52.50 for 52 weeks sticks in my mind). Work
    was available, to be sure, but meaningful, family-supporting
    employment with a future was seemingly nonexistent. At the same
    time, you couldn&rsquo;t afford to take just any work just to tide
    you over, because searching out viable employment was a full-time
    job. It was a real struggle, and it got so I hated to return home at
    night after another fruitless day. The big problem was that I had no
    contacts, so I proceeded to try and invent some.</p>
  <p class="western">Having left home at 18, I had no personal contact
    with anyone of significance. In fact, having been literally out of
    town for twelve years, I no longer even had any local friends, my
    own father was dead, and my father-in-law was a virtual stranger.
    So, where to turn for help in opening doors to employment became a
    matter of top importance. The only possibility that occurred to me
    was to canvass a few of my late father&rsquo;s friends for advice.
    Even here I didn&rsquo;t have much to go on. Not only did I not know
    many of them, they were totally unaware of me. More than that, their
    fields of endeavor were so foreign to any in which I could claim any
    proficiency that the prospect of unearthing a lead here didn&rsquo;t
    seem at all promising. Still, I had no alternative but to seek them
    out, and this I did via my trusty letter-writing approach.</p>
  <p class="western">The first, the then publicity director for
    Catholic University, whom I&rsquo;d been led to believe was a real
    insider buddy of my Pop&rsquo;s, wouldn&rsquo;t even grant me an
    interview. The second, a former District Attorney (under Republican
    administrations) for the District of Columbia, graciously invited me
    to his home for an extended interview. He was long on solid advice
    but short on fruitful contacts. The last, a former Captain in the
    Chaplain Corps of the Navy (and then head of the Department of
    Religion at Catholic University) came up with the only actual
    contact I could garner via this route. He set up an appointment with
    me to be interviewed at the Washington Post as a potential member of
    the editorial writing staff. This one really appealed to me, but I
    blew it. I had prepared a very neat and complete personal r&eacute;sum&eacute;
    package. The Post interviewer reviewed it in my presence in depth,
    pausing to discuss several items, seeking elaboration. Then he came
    to the sticker. You cite here that you&rsquo;re a Roman Catholic.
    I&rsquo;d suggest you delete that from your resume. Well, I
    thereupon thrust my na&iuml;vet&eacute; to the fore, and exclaimed,
    &ldquo;Not at all. If that&rsquo;s a problem for anybody, I&rsquo;d
    want it up front. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to work for such a one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Oh, wow! But after all I&rsquo;d heretofore
    always found frankness to be a most rewarding virtue. Besides, this
    interview had been set up by a Monsignor. On the other hand, such a
    provincial outlook as my remark reflected would hardly be becoming
    in an editorial writer. Moreover, I didn&rsquo;t realize until many
    years later that Katherine Graham (owner-publisher of the Post) is
    from among the top 25 wealthiest <i>Jewish</i> families in America,
    and therefore regarded the world through an entirely different face
    of the prism of philosophy.</p>
  <p class="western">Grandpa Kirk ultimately (perhaps out of
    desperation to get my tribe out of his house &ndash; I joke!)
    provided one of my best leads. He arranged an interview for a job as
    editor of the monthly publication of a national trade association
    headquartered in Washington. Now, he not only arranged this
    interview, he must have done an outstanding selling job on my
    potential. One after another, I was interviewed by every member of
    the headquarters staff. I use the word interviewed advisedly, since
    in fact, rather than attempting to elicit info from me, without
    exception the staff members were rather trying to sell their trade
    association to me! This whole process was so new to me that it took
    me a little while to catch on to what was happening. The scales
    finally dropped from my eyes when I realized the Treasurer was
    striving mightily to convince me that the association was
    financially solid, that I wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about
    security if I hitched the wagon of my career to their star.</p>
  <p class="western">The President of the association had proffered
    all the perks that went with the job and did everything short of
    handing me my own gold-plated key to the private executive washroom.
    The whole thing was a gas. I had it made. Naturally, they&rsquo;d
    all want to get together and talk it over, and concluded with,
    &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call you tomorrow.&rdquo; Actually, they could
    call me &ldquo;Stupid&rdquo;! At the very last minute, as the male
    secretary to the President let me out the door, he shook my hand
    goodbye and casually asked, &ldquo;By the way, how did you come to
    know Harry Kirk?&rdquo; Well, you guessed it. I unthinkingly and
    frankly responded at once, &ldquo;Oh, He&rsquo;s my father-in-law.&rdquo;
    Sorry about that, folks. I&rsquo;m still waiting for that promised
    phone call.</p>
  <p class="western">Meanwhile, time was rushing by, and my funds (we
    had a $6,000 nest egg at separation, a goodly sum in those days)
    were rapidly diminishing. We had bought a well-used fluid-drive
    Chrysler V-8, and within a week had to replace the V-8 at $750!
    Things were getting really desperate, so that I had to forgo trying
    to land a writing billet and opt on exploiting my engineering
    background. I soon ended up in a probationary (non-paying)
    apprentice situation with Sun Auto Co. It specialized in selling
    diagnostic equipment to auto repair shops, thereby guaranteeing that
    any ball-peen hammer mechanic could become a miracle-man
    engine-trouble diagnostician. I traveled in a van over the next
    several weeks to virtually every auto repair shop in the Washington
    metro area.</p>
  <p class="western">I learned the fine points of setting distributor
    dwell, timing ignitions, gapping plugs, fine-tuning carburetors for
    most efficient exhaust mixtures, and even disassembling, repairing
    and setting voltage regulators (which are now factory sealed and
    replaced as a unit). The key to doing all of this with maximum
    efficiency was, of course, Sun Auto Co. equipment. It wasn&rsquo;t
    cheap. (I must visit some diagnostic shops someday and see what kind
    of equipment they&rsquo;re using now. Surely, it&rsquo;s now all
    electronic gear.) But, as I say, the old electro-mechanical
    diagnostic gear wasn&rsquo;t cheap. And, Aye! there&rsquo;s the rub.
    This turned out to be more a <i>sales</i> than an <i>engineering</i>
    job, and so we parted company.</p>
  <p class="western">Israel won its independence on 14 May 1948, but I
    was still struggling mightily for mine. At this point I resignedly
    turned to the Washington metro area&rsquo;s major employer, the U.S.
    Government. Day-in and day-out I plied my way all over town by bus
    and streetcar from one agency to another. I can remember riding a
    Georgia Avenue streetcar one day and observing all the cheerful
    people in the car &ndash; young, old, short, tall, thin, fat, white,
    black, male and female &ndash; and all I could think was: &ldquo;Every
    damn one of them has a job and I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; It was really
    getting to me. Another day I sat in front of two young black male
    collegians on a bus. The statement that grabbed my attention was one
    which summed up their discussion: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! You&rsquo;re
    born, you grow, you mate, you reproduce, and you die. That&rsquo;s
    life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Now, it may strike the reader as ludicrous, but
    this little tidbit seemed to put my situation in perspective, and
    all at once I felt at peace with myself for the first time since I&rsquo;d
    gotten out of the service. After all, I was already almost all the
    way through that cycle. I had already reproduced, and only dying
    remained. I knew life, therefore, and a job no longer seemed the
    obsessive focus it had become. Maybe the consequent quasi-serenity
    that then engulfed me was the key to the soon-to-materialize
    solution to my job hunting dilemma. In any case, it wasn&rsquo;t
    long then until I had signed on to begin work as a Patent Examiner.
    This, it seemed to me, was a uniquely fitting parlay of my
    engineering-legal-writing background. I was to report to work at the
    beginning of the following month &ndash; Tuesday, 7 Sep, the day
    following Labor Day. Labor Day! How appropriate!</p>
  <p class="western">Kathleen and I immediately set about
    house-hunting with a vengeance. Silver Spring was then the really
    &ldquo;in&rdquo; place for upwardly mobile young families, so we
    concentrated there. This proved fruitless at first, since most of
    the available housing there was relatively large and expensive
    pre-WWII stuff. So we had to expand our search westward to new
    housing developments in a spot on the map called Wheaton, and even
    to Kensington. Most of this new housing, at least such as we could
    afford, was pretty much of the match-box variety designed for
    acquisition via meager Veterans loans. It was what you might call
    (after today&rsquo;s raw airline transportation) no-frills housing:
    no basements, no garages, no landscaping, no appliances, no window
    shades or screens, etc. More than that, they were all uniformly
    box-like, small, and densely packed together &ndash; your basic
    wallboard based on cinder block. JC surely made out better at
    Bethlehem. You can still find rows of them along Viers Mill and
    Randolph Roads. No matter, we finally found one in Kensington which
    we thought we could afford, and were about to settle, when suddenly
    we got really lucky. We somehow stumbled on a mere two-house
    development in Silver Spring being handled by a young agent
    operating off of the dining room table in his own equally humble
    home. This house, at 10104 Dallas Avenue, was a comparative little
    gem. It had removable, double-sash, aluminum-framed, and fully
    screened windows; a then-unheard-of structural steel beam center
    joist; hardwood floors; all copper piping; asbestos (fire-proof,
    insulating, no maintenance) siding; and <i>real plaster walls</i>!
    It had 2 bedrooms up, one down, l-and-1/2 baths, a side porch, and a
    fireplace! Hey! All this and heaven too! They wanted $10,750 for it.
    We signed up on the spot.</p>
  <p class="western">But hold it! Still no light at the end of the
    tunnel. In almost no time at all our agent was back in touch with
    the depressing news that my anticipated Patent Office salary was
    insufficient to support the required mortgage. I just told the agent
    to hold fast, that I&rsquo;d get back to him with a new figure.
    (&ldquo;Amen! Amen! I haven&rsquo;t seen such faith in all Israel!&rdquo;)
    So it was back to the job-go-round again. But this time I didn&rsquo;t
    fool around. I headed straight for the Navy Department. Necessity
    had at long last overcome pride. The best possible price for my Navy
    experience just had to be found with the Department of the Navy. I
    headed directly for Personnel, and there had the good fortune to be
    interviewed by a Mrs. Dorothy Masters (later to become a very good
    friend). I may have been desperate, but (forgive me!) I also was
    personable, and Mrs. Masters seemingly took an instant liking to me
    and made me her #1 hiring project. She got on the phone to a Mr.
    George Fonger, Head of the Machinery Design Branch of the Bureau of
    Ships, and then and there purred (&ldquo;before my own ears,&rdquo;
    so to speak), &ldquo;George, I found just the man for you we&rsquo;ve
    been looking for.&rdquo; Well, that did it. Quicker than it takes to
    relate I was all signed up. Not only that, like my first Navy boss,
    Cdr Slavin, George Fonger turned out to be the best civilian boss I
    ever had or anyone could ever hope to have! I reported to him in
    Code 434, at 0800 on 21 Sep 1948 ready to work as a GS10 Marine
    Engineer at $5,232 per annum. Our civilian career was launched. Our
    mortgage on 10104 Dallas Avenue was consummated. I sent the Patent
    Office my regrets. The world went on: Harry Truman upset Dewey in
    Nov, Alger Hiss was indicted on 15 Dec, Tojo was hanged on 23 Dec.</p>
  <p class="western">We were moving on, too. We left 1404 Otis Street
    and moved into our new home &ndash; the <i>first</i> of our very own
    &ndash; on New Year&rsquo;s Eve 1948. This was also the very year
    that St. Bernadette&rsquo;s was established as a parish. What a
    fitting way to start a new year and mark the start of a new life!
    Uncle Jimmy and Uncle Tom helped us move, and though our worldly
    goods were small potatoes, we spent the whole day tripping back and
    forth between Brookland and Silver Spring. I was only 30 years old,
    but I can still remember how bone-weary I was at day&rsquo;s end.</p>
  <p class="western">Of course Kathleen wasn&rsquo;t in on the move.
    She&rsquo;d had the foresight to go to Columbia Hospital to give
    birth to Charlie on 22 Dec. The complications attending this
    delivery have been recounted earlier but, as a consequence of them,
    Kathleen left for the hospital from Otis Street, but she returned
    from the hospital to Dallas Avenue. Not a soul was awake at midnight
    to cheer in the New Year our first night at 10104 Dallas Avenue. Of
    course Kathleen and Charlie <i>were</i> awake for 2200 and 0200
    feedings, but I slept right through those too. I resolved then and
    there that I&rsquo;d never again move things myself &ndash; and we
    never have.</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, this little gem of a house, which our
    family too quickly outgrew, cost a smashing $10,750. I don&rsquo;t
    remember how much mortgage we carried, but I <i>do</i> remember that
    we had to borrow $500 from Grandpa Kirk at the last minute to make
    up our cash deficiency. (This was my first experience with
    unexpected realtors&rsquo; fees for this and that and then some.) We
    paid him back some years later with full interest up to the last
    penny. Our house was less than 6 miles from my birthplace, but the
    Silver Spring area has never replaced Brookland as home in my mind.
    The fall and spring smells are somehow different. So were the
    sounds, both natural and man-made. They, too, were strange. For
    example, shortly after we moved in I was up one night and wildly
    searching all over the house to locate a weird noise that we were
    certain signaled an incipient explosion of the furnace at the very
    least. It seems we were experiencing our first rainfall in our new
    house, and the noise turned out to be rain water gurgling through
    the downspout just outside our bedroom window. Live and learn.</p>
  <p class="western">I found my new job just about a perfect match for
    my interests and my talents. More than that, I never worked with a
    nicer or more talented group of individuals. Beyond that, as
    indicated earlier, my first civilian boss was truly exceptional. He
    was a crack naval architect, a graduate of famed Webb Institute, the
    foremost naval architect factory in the country. He was also a
    first-rate gentleman in every respect. Had the term gentleman not
    existed, it would have had to be invented to describe this superb
    government servant. In appearance he was a gray-haired Ronald
    Colman, complete with dashing mustache and super-suave manner. (As a
    token of admiration rather than in jest, I quickly labeled him,
    which stuck forever after, &ldquo;Velvet Throat.&rdquo;)</p>
  <p class="western">He could disapprove a leave request or turn down
    a promotion request with such precise logic, exquisite justice, and
    overall smoothness that you&rsquo;d wish you&rsquo;d never been so
    outrageous as to have brought up such matters in the first place.</p>
  <p class="western">Not only that, he was a master planner (he could
    predict, almost to the hour of the day, when a set of completed and
    inked contract plans for, say, a new supercarrier machinery layout,
    would be ready), and he knew as much about personnel regulations and
    similar administrative rules and practices as our assigned
    specialist, Mrs. Masters. I couldn&rsquo;t have had a better
    instructor in post-graduate civilian office management. I owe him a
    tremendous debt for my own subsequent success, and hence must pause
    right here to salute him: &ldquo;<i>Well Done!</i> George Fonger,
    wherever you are!&rdquo; (I believe his brother had a son in John&rsquo;s
    class at Good Counsel.) He was a fine man and (though he might find
    it hard to believe) a terrific model for me &ndash; a great
    influence!</p>
  <p class="western">As to the job itself, I was virtually my own
    boss, almost in business for myself. My job was in the Machinery
    Arrangement and Engineering Piping Division of the Design Branch of
    the Bureau of Ships. Whenever a new design vessel is to be built, if
    it isn&rsquo;t built in a Naval Shipyard, it is built under contract
    with private shipbuilding concerns, like Newport News Shipbuilding
    and Drydock Corporation at Hampton Roads in Virginia. Part of this
    contract is a set of so-called contract plans which, together with
    voluminous detailed specifications, convey the form and substance of
    the desired ship to the builders. Our Division supplied the
    arrangement plans for the propulsion machinery plant (together with
    all requisite supporting auxiliary equipment such as
    electrical-power-generating and salt-water-evaporating equipment)
    and associated engineering piping systems (such as main steam,
    auxiliary steam, auxiliary exhaust, fresh and salt water, and fuel
    and lube oil systems). We therefore essentially comprised a battery
    of some one-to-two-dozen draftsmen.</p>
  <p class="western">These highly skilled professionals were divided
    into machinery arrangement and piping sections, each headed by a
    GS-13 supervisor. These two fellows, plus their boss, a GS-14,
    worked from conventional desks. To this little cadre I was added as
    the 4th <i>deskman</i>, starting at GS-10 and working up to GS-12 &ndash;
    which was the vertical ceiling for me there, unless one of the
    higher-level three died or departed and I could qualify (which was
    extremely doubtful) for their job. I say extremely doubtful because
    my function was totally distinct from everyone else&rsquo;s in the
    Division. They were all draftsmen or draftsman supervisors. The
    draftsman supervisors spent very little time at their desk, always
    moving about looking over some draftsman&rsquo;s shoulder with
    advice or suggestions. In contrast I was virtually the only
    full-time desk man in the entire bay. Incidentally, because these
    plans were a long time in the making, remaining thumb-tacked atop
    long drawing boards through hot and cold, dry and damp seasonal
    changes, and thus subject to shrinkage and expansion with climatic
    changes, our bay was then just about the only one (aside from the
    hull plans design Division) that was air-conditioned in those
    ancient days. A nice fringe benefit indeed!</p>
  <p class="western">So, what precisely was my desk job, you might
    well ask. Hey! I was going to tell you more than you&rsquo;ll ever
    want to know anyway. Well, every new design was exactly that &ndash;
    it was new! The machinery involved was more powerful, heavier, and
    larger than that which had gone before. There was therefore no
    precedent with regard to actual size of the various units comprising
    the plant, and therefore the draftsmen&rsquo;s most vital need was
    detailed information on the space and configuration requirements of
    the various plant elements involved. You couldn&rsquo;t look up such
    information in manufacturers&rsquo; catalogs because this bigger,
    faster, NEW equipment hadn&rsquo;t been built yet. This, then,
    became my job &ndash; to supply machinery arrangement draftsmen with
    space and configuration details for all the machinery components
    comprising the entire new ship propulsion plant.</p>
  <p class="western">The term &ldquo;configuration&rdquo; may warrant
    a little elaboration. It wasn&rsquo;t enough to know merely that
    size and outline of a machinery component, you had to know how each
    element had to be configured (oriented) with respect to related
    elements, and how it had to be configured (set apart) from other
    machinery components and bulkhead and piping to enable access for
    both operation and repair or maintenance. For example, at one time
    space had to be left to enable snaking hundreds of long tubes via
    machinery space access ways in order to re-tube main propulsion
    turbine steam condensers. We devised the alternative of introducing
    such replacement tubes via the main condenser cooling water scoop
    while the vessel was in drydock, thereby cutting down considerably
    on access space requirements. (More about this scoop later. For now,
    you need only know that the progress of the vessel through the water
    scoops circulating sea water, via a lipped hole in the hull, right
    through the condenser and thence overboard. This scoop is
    supplemented by a pump when the vessel is at rest or going astern.)</p>
  <p class="western">Well, since there was no precedent for my job, I
    literally had no superior. In a sense, given the overall object, my
    job then became what I chose to make it. I chose to make the most of
    it. I spent a great deal of time, between actual new design
    projects, digging into marine engineering tomes at the Library of
    Congress, and an equal amount of time contacting and pumping
    machinery manufacturers (like Babcock &amp; Wilcox, Foster-Wheeler,
    Combustion Engineering) and ship design firms (like Gibbs &amp; Cox,
    Whittlesey &amp; Sons, Sparkman &amp; Stevens) for insights into
    extrapolating machinery design parameters beyond the limits of
    existing products. I became a genius of the empirical method, and
    got truly proficient at my task. The congruence of my initial
    estimates with the ultimately resulting products became a legend. In
    the process I amassed a compendium of design thumb-rules that was
    truly unique. I was highly tempted to take it with me when I left,
    but instead turned it over to a guy I considered the most
    knowledgeable draftsman. I&rsquo;ve often wondered how much of its
    arcane contents others might ever be able to interpret correctly and
    wonder if it might still be in use to this day. (I learned at a 1985
    Design Branch reunion at the Bethesda O-Club that it was!)</p>
  <p class="western">My contact with the ship design firms alluded to
    above led to another aspect of my ever-evolving job. I became the
    BuShips Machinery and Piping Arrangement liaison with all the ship
    design firms. That is, new projects were sometimes so numerous that
    we had to farm out the development of contract plans to private
    design firms. They submitted all such plans via me for review and
    mark-up, and all modifications and suggestions for improvements were
    then funneled to me for correlation, polishing, and transmission
    back to the design firms. (I always thought that as a consequence of
    the contacts made here, and the dispatch with which I handled the
    job, that I might eventually have landed a good job with any of the
    private ship design firms.)</p>
  <p class="western">One of the first and biggest things I learned in
    this job (and which I found to be true of the computer field when I
    transitioned to it) is that you really don&rsquo;t have to know too
    much about the innards of or theory underlying machinery (or
    computers) to deal with or utilize them intelligently. I must give
    Admiral Hyman Rickover as assist for this insight. He addressed us
    once at P.G. School (he was then a LCdr.), and in response to a
    question of how could a more-or-less general officer effectively
    quibble with a private professional specialist about machinery
    performance details, he replied: &ldquo;Details, Hell! You <i>don&rsquo;t</i>
    quibble about details. You don&rsquo;t even have to review his
    proposals. Whatever he presents, you just glance at it and then
    bellow &lsquo;Double the power and halve the size and weight and
    then I may give it some consideration!&rsquo; &ndash; then push him
    out of your office.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">He was right, of course. Our job was to pack more
    power at less weight in less space. It was the manufacturers&rsquo;
    job to figure out the details of how this might be done. Design, in
    the truest sense, must always remain a primitive art. If it is, in
    fact, design, then it hasn&rsquo;t been done before &ndash; that is
    precisely the challenge, and the satisfaction. It&rsquo;s all so
    primitive. For example, a big space-consumer is the requirement for
    <i>access</i>. I was amazed to discover that there were absolutely
    no design parameters or criteria in all of BuShips indicating how
    many access routes were appropriate for machinery spaces, or of what
    type they should be, and how they should be oriented with respect to
    each other. I thereupon developed a design guide for machinery space
    access provisions. You can look up my article on the subject as
    published in the Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers:
    <i>Accent on Access &ndash; the Ins and Outs of Machinery Spaces</i>
    (May 1953)<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote51anc" href="#sdendnote51sym"><sup>51</sup></a>.</p>
  <p class="western">Soon we were winging through 1949. On 18 Mar NATO
    was founded. In Apr of 1949 my mother sold my childhood home at 4315
    13th Street in Brookland, and moved with my sister, Margaret, into
    an apartment on East-West Highway just around the corner from where
    Anne and Doug once had an apartment on Red Top Road. Toward the
    middle of May, the eyes of the world were focused on the end of the
    Berlin airlift, but my total attention was then claimed by a
    personal tragedy in my mother&rsquo;s side of the family. Out of
    consideration for the feelings of those involved, I shall be brief,
    and stick to the details concerning only my part in the matter. On 7
    May 1949, when Kathleen was nearing term in her pregnancy with
    Martha [Martha begs to differ, as she was born in July 1950; this
    must have happened in 1950], a first cousin of mine (the daughter of
    one of my mother&rsquo;s brothers) stabbed her husband to death in
    their apartment. (Let us just say that he was a renowned wife-beater
    who couldn&rsquo;t handle one beer without getting vicious, and
    there was an immediate and well-founded presumption of my cousin
    acting in self-defense. She and her mother each weighed less than 90
    pounds, while the victim was a sturdy ex-Army Sergeant.)</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, their household at that time also
    included my cousin&rsquo;s frail eighty-some-year-old mother and my
    cousin&rsquo;s youngest (4-to-5-year-old) daughter. The tragedy
    occurred early in the evening and the three females remained there
    huddled together in the dark all night long in the living room of
    their apartment, with the deceased still sprawled on the kitchen
    floor. At dawn my cousin finally phoned another cousin for advice,
    and in no time at all he was on the scene, soon followed by the
    police. My cousin was in due course trundled off to the DC jail, and
    I finally got word of these unfortunate developments from my
    cousin&rsquo;s only son, a WWII Navy veteran and my first god-child.
    Shortly thereafter I was contacted by the husband of my cousin&rsquo;s
    other and older daughter with a request that I join a family parley
    to discuss what could and should be done next.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, a whole series of late-night parleys
    followed thereafter. This planning group essentially comprised my
    cousin&rsquo;s son, his brother-in-law (at whose house the meetings
    were held), the brother-in-law of the latter (a railroad detective
    and quasi-lawyer familiar with police routine), the latter&rsquo;s
    wife, and myself. Meanwhile my cousin still languished in the DC
    jail awaiting a court of inquiry, a hearing held to determine
    whether or not grounds existed for instituting an indictment for
    criminal action. Clearly, the first order of business was to secure
    the services of a good lawyer. It was agreed that I would go to see
    my father&rsquo;s friend (whom I had consulted earlier in behalf of
    my own job hunt), former District Attorney Leo Rover. Mr. Rover was
    very solicitous and commended us to a young lawyer friend, whom we
    shall call Mr. Unable, and set him in motion by a phone call then
    and there.</p>
  <p class="western">So, Mr. Unable proceeded to the DC jail, a most
    depressing place, which I also visited (and I had to make a visit to
    the morgue as well). To make a long story short, my cousin continued
    to languish in jail, we became very disenchanted with Mr. Unable&rsquo;s
    seeming ineptitude (I felt I knew more law than he did and that
    perhaps Mr. Rover was incidentally trying to help an understandably
    unsuccessful friend.). We discharged Mr. Unable and refused his bill
    for what we felt were non-services. He didn&rsquo;t press the
    matter. Our panel thereupon renewed our quest for a good lawyer. We
    were in session one night around 10 to 11 pm, discussing lawyers,
    when someone brought up the name of an extremely flamboyant DC
    lawyer named James J. Laughlin. He was pictured as an extremely
    successful but somewhat shady shyster, and was then in the headlines
    as the defender of <i>Axis Sally</i> (Mildred E. Gillars of WWII
    fame). Suddenly we decided that if we could find him in the phone
    book we&rsquo;d just give him a call for advice. He was in the book
    and so we called. His response: <i>Come right on over, boys</i>.
    Unbelievable! So we all immediately set out for his Foxhall Road
    villa.</p>
  <p class="western">This was a truly fantastic experience. Here we
    all were sitting around the dining room table of a frontline lawyer
    at midnight and he didn&rsquo;t know any of us from Adam. After a
    brief discussion, he summed matters up, thus: &ldquo;This is quite
    ridiculous. Your cousin should have been freed immediately. I&rsquo;ll
    drop by the city jail tomorrow and obtain her release, so you&rsquo;d
    better make arrangements to pick her up. Also, I&rsquo;ll expedite
    the hearing and will be there to represent. Now you all go home and
    don&rsquo;t worry about a thing.&rdquo; Amazing! Well, we did, and
    he did as he promised. I picked up my cousin the next day (none of
    <i>her</i> children could then accommodate her) and brought her home
    to live with us. We gave her the downstairs bedroom on Dallas
    Avenue. (I neglected to mention that we had taken in her young
    daughter the day following the tragedy, so mother and daughter were
    together again at our house. George and Anne then shared one of the
    upstairs bedrooms, Charlie was still in a crib in the bedroom
    Kathleen and I shared.)</p>
  <p class="western">Meanwhile, the victim was interred at Arlington
    National Cemetery with full military honors. At the same time,
    Laughlin also made short work of the hearing. In a matter of minutes
    he secured my cousin&rsquo;s outright release, free of all charges,
    and added only this personal admonition to my cousin, &ldquo;If you
    don&rsquo;t want to open a real can of worms I <i>strongly</i>
    recommend that you never attempt to collect on your late husband&rsquo;s
    GI insurance.&rdquo; With that he was gone, after hand-shakes and
    goodbyes all around, and we never saw or heard from him again. <i>There
      was NO bill!</i> This man, now deceased, was no shyster. Somehow, I
    just can&rsquo;t picture Edward Bennett Williams (then defending
    <i>Tokyo Rose</i>) responding as Laughlin did. Laughlin, by the way,
    did get <i>Axis Sally</i> acquitted of all but one of eight counts
    of treason.</p>
  <p class="western">Before concluding this unusual little episode,
    two other eerie sidelights should be mentioned. It became my lot
    (together with the brother-in-law) to tidy up the scene of the
    tragedy. (It should be emphasized that my cousin&rsquo;s children
    weren&rsquo;t unfeeling, they were simply in a state of lingering
    shock. They couldn&rsquo;t bring themselves to go near the place or
    to even confront their mother at that time. Today the now-divorced
    son lives alone with his mother.) Anyhow, this little chore was a
    really unsavory business. After all, the body had lain overnight,
    bleeding profusely all over the floor, and in the intervening period
    before we could perform the clean-up the blood had dried rock-hard.
    There was also a considerable stench. We opened all the windows,
    drenched the site with Lysol, and had to actually chip up the blood
    with a putty knife. Following that, we set it afire in a wire-like
    basket in the backyard. The odor from the fire must have drawn every
    meowing cat within a mile to the scene, and every window in the
    neighborhood had dumbfounded people staring out, wondering
    <i>whatinhell</i> was going on. We really felt conspicuous and
    decidedly uneasy. We got out of there as quickly as we could and I
    couldn&rsquo;t even tolerate the smell of fried chicken for almost a
    dozen years. I still can&rsquo;t bring myself to eat it.</p>
  <p class="western">The other eerie episode followed Martha&rsquo;s
    birth. That&rsquo;s when we got our first TV, you&rsquo;ll remember.
    Hardly a night would go by but Kathleen and I and my cousin would be
    watching when inevitably there on the screen they&rsquo;d be
    depicting a stabbing. We&rsquo;d all sit there staring straight
    ahead, silently, unseeing, and our flesh would start to crawl. It
    got so we were afraid to turn the damn set on when my cousin was
    around. Fortunately, our visitors departed for a place of their own
    soon after Martha&rsquo;s birth. I hope there&rsquo;s a lesson here
    somewhere about what it means to be &ldquo;a good neighbor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">So, back to the drawing board. Hey! I can really
    say that. Remember? Drawing boards were what my office was all about
    &ndash; that and new ship design, of course. At about this time,
    mid-1949, we commenced the first post-WWII design of a new destroyer
    escort type (DE). This would be the first new design to take into
    account the new threats posed by atomic weapons. I was appointed
    Project Director for this design (and my signature will be found as
    such on all the contract machinery arrangement and engineering
    piping system plans for this vessel), so my first task became to
    review and analyze the then-highly-classified reports of the 1946
    Bikini Atoll tests of the use of atomic weapons against naval
    vessels.</p>
  <p class="western">Atomic weapons, of course, were a &ldquo;triple
    threat&rdquo; to all targets. In addition to the blast effect they
    shared with conventional weapons (though atomic blasts are of much
    greater magnitude), they also presented the dual threats of intense
    heat and widespread radioactive fallout. All three of these aspects
    had to be evaluated and considered in the development of our new
    design. Like the battle damage reports I alluded to earlier, the
    Bikini reports were voluminous and comprehensive and extremely well
    done. It&rsquo;s a shame, really, that they haven&rsquo;t after all
    the intervening years become more well publicized. I can&rsquo;t go
    into too many specifics here, but suffice it to say that I&rsquo;m
    frequently amused by newspaper analyses of potential nuclear warfare
    scenarios that betray a total ignorance of the most fundamental
    facts disclosed by the Bikini experience.</p>
  <p class="western">It would be laughable were it not for the almost
    criminal implications and disastrous economic results of some of the
    erroneous conclusions so frequently drawn. At the same time, I must
    preface the following remarks with a note of caution. I&rsquo;m
    reminded of what Ike referred to as &ldquo;the only off-color story
    I know,&rdquo; which is to the effect that, &ldquo;There are only
    two professions in which the amateurs always think they are better
    than the professionals &ndash; military strategy and prostitution.&rdquo;
    There <i>is</i> a real danger here. The amateur (such as I) isn&rsquo;t
    privy to either the current state of the art or current intelligence
    with respect to both enemy capabilities and intentions. So, What
    follows is no more than my amateur, if honest, opinion.</p>
  <p class="western">My remarks here will be necessarily confined to
    published information with respect to the Bikini experience. The
    following excerpt from Neal Hines&rsquo; excellent 1962 book
    entitled, <i>Proving Ground: An Account of the Radiological Studies
      in the Pacific</i>, is not only pertinent background here, but is in
    my opinion of sufficient importance as to warrant further
    publicizing in its own right, that is, <i>the public should be made
      more aware</i>! I therefore beg your indulgence and I summon your
    concentrated attention to the following admittedly lengthy
    background material anent the 1946 explosion of two atomic bombs at
    Bikini:</p>
  <p class="quote-western"><i>INITIAL REPORT</i> &ndash; The military
    interest was large, because the atomic weapon was recognized as
    having revolutionized and outmoded earlier concepts of warfare, even
    those developed by the proliferating technology of WWII&hellip; The
    tests were conducted under the code name <i>Crossroads</i>, as one
    appropriately symbolic, presumably, of the dilemma of a world now
    offered a choice between peace and atomic destruction&hellip; Three
    explosions originally were projected, two (ABLE &amp; BAKER) finally
    detonated, the first (at 0900 local) on l Jul 46 (30 Jun in the
    U.S.) at a height of 518 feet over a fleet of (83) naval vessels
    anchored within Bikini Atoll, and the second on 25 Jul at a depth of
    90 feet beneath the surface of Bikini Lagoon. The devices were of
    the same type as those used over Japan, yielding the equivalent of
    20,000 tons of TNT&hellip;</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The second explosion, the underwater
    detonation, would be accompanied by a phenomenon never observed
    before (or since)&hellip; The airburst (at 518 feet) of l Jul,
    despite the damage it had inflicted, scarcely had prepared observers
    for the wrath of sound, light, and volcanic shock (of BAKER) that
    erupted within the lagoon. At the moment of explosion a giant
    bubble, brilliantly lighted within by incandescent materials, burst
    from the surface of the water followed by an opaque cloud which
    quickly covered about half of the ships of the target fleet. Within
    seconds the cloud had vanished and a hollow column 2,200 feet in
    diameter and containing some 10 million tons of water rose from the
    surface of the lagoon to a height of more than a mile.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The 26,000-ton battleship Arkansas,
    broadside to the LSM 60 (under and from which BAKER was suspended 90
    feet below) but more than 500 feet away, was <i>lifted and upended</i>
    in the column before she was plunged to the bottom. At the base of
    the column was a tumult of foam several hundred feet high, and the
    descent of the water back into the lagoon set up a base surge from
    which rolled <i>waves 80 to 100 feet high</i>. The waves subsided
    rapidly as they proceeded outward, and the highest wave recorded at
    Bikini Island three miles away, was seven feet, not sufficiently
    high to pass over the island or to cause damage there. The victims
    of the explosion, beyond the Arkansas, included the Saratoga, which
    sank after 7-1/2 hours, a landing ship, a landing craft, and an
    oiler; submerged submarines &hellip; and the already damaged
    battleship Nagato, which went down five days later, the destroyer
    Hughes and the transport Fallon, seriously crippled and listing,
    which were beached.</p>
  <p class="quote-western"><i>Radioactivity in the waters in the
    lagoon was intense</i>. The volume after the burst was estimated in
    the round &hellip; to be <i>equivalent to many hundred tons of
      radium</i>. The target ships were drenched by radioactive substances
    as the tremendous pillar of water crashed back into the lagoon. As
    the weight of the column subsided, the target area became a
    maelstrom of radioactive debris&hellip; The <i>upper levels of the
      lagoon waters remained highly radioactive for days</i> and large
    areas were impenetrable&hellip; <i>After 4 days</i> it still was not
    safe for inspection parties to spend any useful time at the target
    area or to board surviving ships floating there.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Although lethal results might have been
    more or less equivalent, the radiological phenomena accompanying the
    2 bursts were markedly different. In the case of the airburst of the
    (nominal) first bomb, it seems certain that the unprotected
    personnel within 1 mile would have suffered high casualties by
    intense neutron and gamma radiation as well as by blast and heat.
    Those surviving immediate effects would not have been menaced by
    radioactivity persisting after the burst. In the case of the
    underwater (second) explosion, the airburst wave was far less
    intense and there was no heat wave of significance.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Moreover, because of the absorption of
    neutron and gamma rays by the water, the lethal quality of the first
    flash of radiation was not of high order. But the second bomb threw
    <i>large masses of highly radioactive water</i> onto the decks and
    into the hulls of the vessels. These <i>contaminated ships became
      radioactive stoves</i>, and would have burned all living things
    aboard them with invisible and painless but deadly radiation. It is
    too soon to attempt an analysis of all the implications of the
    Bikini tests, but &hellip; the poisoning of large volumes of water &hellip;
    presents &hellip; a problem.</p>
  <p class="quote-western"><i>ONE YEAR LATER</i> &ndash; The Navy
    reoccupied Bikini Island today (15 Jul 47), just <i>355 days after

    target fleet. Geiger counters indicated some radioactivity on the

  <p class="quote-western">WASHINGTON TIMES 28 Nov 1983: <i>Nearly
    three decades after the last atomic bomb tests on Bikini Atoll, the
    Pacific islands are still $100 billion away from being safely
    habitable</i>, a private group of scientists said yesterday. Fish
    and rain water is safe on the 26 islands that make up the atoll, the
    study by five scientists said, but without a $100-billion cleanup
    <i>any food grown on the islands still would be dangerously
      contaminated with radioactivity for the next 100 years</i>. [Article
    in its hidden-away entirety.]</p>
  <p class="western">Now I ask you, how familiar were you with this
    (only one ever) underwater atomic explosion phenomenon <i>before</i>
    you read the preceding excerpts? I&rsquo;m willing to bet it was a
    virtual news flash. Well, I submit that this information is just
    about the most vitally significant information about the potential
    dimensions of atomic disaster that can be imagined. And, while we&rsquo;re
    still imagining, let&rsquo;s include an excerpt from an early 1984
    Jack Anderson column:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">In the novel <i>The Fifth Horseman</i>,
    Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi acquires material to build nuclear
    weapons, then plays a deadly game of blackmail by hiding a nuclear
    bomb in New York City. Could such a thing happen in the real world?
    The answer is yes. The unbelievably lax security at top-secret U.S.
    nuclear weapons plants makes this work of fiction frighteningly
    possible. Weapons-grade material is regularly lost or stolen; the
    factories are protected by sensors and alarm systems that don&rsquo;t
    always work; and the guards sometimes behave like Keystone Kops.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, let&rsquo;s take the plot a step further.
    Let&rsquo;s suppose old Muammar hides his nuclear bomb <i>below
      water</i> in New York Harbor. Now, treat your mind&rsquo;s eye to an
    instant replay of the report above on the underwater Bikini
    explosion. Voila! <i>New York harbor would be radioactive for more
      than 100 years</i>! And then there are Navy yard harbors at Boston,
    Portsmouth, Philadelphia, Norfolk, Charleston, Puget Sound, San
    Francisco, and Pearl Harbor, not to mention such industrial cities
    as New Orleans, Mobile, and Galveston on the Gulf, or Chicago,
    Cleveland and Detroit on the Great Lakes. Get the picture? Much of
    our industrial might and military seapower would be neutralized for
    more than 100 years, while our capability to project any residual
    military might via shipping would be gone as well! But, you might
    object, there would be problems with the delivery system the
    underwater pre-placement of such nuclear devices. Don&rsquo;t you
    believe it! <i>What makes you think such bombs might not be in place
      right this very minute?</i></p>
  <p class="western">The fact is that any dumpy-looking tramp steamer
    could be easily rigged for depositing such weapons on harbor bottoms
    in the course of any routine-appearing passage in or out or port.
    Prior to our longshoremen&rsquo;s boycott due to the Afghanistan
    invasion by Russia, Soviet merchant ships were calling regularly at
    some 60 different ports along the U.S. east, west, and gulf coasts
    as well as the Great Lakes. They are still operating to well over
    125 countries in the world with more than 1,700 ships currently in
    service. Then again, there are some 375 Soviet submarines. Whatever
    clandestine drill the Russians were up to in Swedish harbors in
    early 1984, the very fact of these ventures testifies that their
    submarines can penetrate <i>some</i> foreign harbors successfully
    and thus conceivably seed them with latent remote-controlled nuclear
    explosive devices. And, <i>what good are ships without harbors?</i></p>
  <p class="western">There should be no need to further labor my
    essential point: the delivery of atomic weapons need not await an
    outbreak of hostilities or be effected via alarm-ringing military
    means. They could be pre-positioned well in advance by the most
    innocuous tramp steamer, not to mention virtually silent and
    invisible submarines. An obvious corollary to all this is that pure
    comparisons of raw military statistics don&rsquo;t begin to portray
    the limits of current threats to our national security. More
    imagination in war-gaming is therefore required. Too many military
    professionals too often base future plans on past experience, and
    radically new developments have long since markedly outrun our WWII
    battle experience. It would therefore be foolhardy not to allow for
    the possibility that supercarriers might be as quickly proven to be
    obsolete in WWIII as battleships were in WWII, even before the Pearl
    Harbor disaster.</p>
  <p class="western">Now all the foregoing is not such a huge
    digression as it might seem. After all, what underlies everything
    being said here concerns the design of combatant vessels, and the
    latter <i>was</i> my business from 1948 to 1955, when post-WWII
    warship design got underway. But, you might exclaim, my experience
    was all some thirty years ago! True, but a quasi-authoritative 1983
    publication anent current U.S. naval practice unequivocally confirms
    that the 1946 Bikini A-bomb tests that I was charged with evaluating
    in 1948 are &ldquo;still the basis for the Navy&rsquo;s protective
    ship-design practices.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">It is also interesting that a 1978 Senate Report
    recommended an accent on a multiplicity of smaller military vessels
    in lieu of the supercarriers evolved since WWII, even as I
    recommended in 1948! This report worried that even then (in 1978),
    <i>the Soviets had more than 100 missiles aimed at each of our large
      ships</i>, &ldquo;which can only be in one place at one time&rdquo;
    with an &ldquo;all-our-eggs-in-one-basket result.&rdquo; I predicted
    in my 1948 report that any nuclear-armed surface vessel would by
    virtue of that very fact become a prime target of the enemy. &ldquo;Get
    the carriers!&rdquo; will be the initial catch-phrase of WWIII, I
    then maintained, and I still so maintain today! (It is noteworthy
    that even in WWII the <i>prime</i> objective of the Pearl Harbor
    raid was the carriers, and the Japanese were sorely disappointed at
    their absence.)</p>
  <p class="western">I have to pursue this. First, because adapting
    the lessons learned at Bikini to modern warship propulsion plant
    design was at that point in time my life. Second, because I firmly
    believe that Ralph Edwards could well say of us all today anent
    potential nuclear conflict: &ldquo;This is <i>YOUR</i> life!&rdquo;
    Now, as I write in mid-1984, President Reagan has standing orders
    for the simultaneous construction of two Nimitz-class supercarriers,
    at a price tag of 3.6 billion dollars each (plus 2.6 billion dollars
    for their aircraft, plus billions more for their support ships),
    thereby opting for the supercarrier option with a real economic
    vengeance.</p>
  <p class="western">Now, we&rsquo;re talking here about the
    equivalent of <i>100</i> B-1 strategic bombers or <i>75</i> MX
    intercontinental ballistic missiles in their silos. Ah, silos! The
    Navy contention is that they are fixed in place, whereas carriers
    can run at 30-plus knots over the 73% of the earth&rsquo;s surface
    that is water. Alas! This 73% of the earth&rsquo;s surface is
    virtually (at least intermittently) covered by 100% satellite
    surveillance. As Joe Louis remarked long ago anent his
    &ldquo;bum-of-the-month&rdquo; opponents, &ldquo;They can run, but
    they can&rsquo;t hide!&rdquo;<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote52anc" href="#sdendnote52sym"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
  <p class="western">Further, it is interesting that these expensive
    supercarrier targets are <i>required</i> (their proponents&rsquo;
    word) to bottle up the Russian fleet (as though a few well-placed
    underwater atomic bursts couldn&rsquo;t do the same)! Of course this
    avowed mission of carrier power-projection toward the USSR would
    also enable the Russians to concentrate/focus detection/retaliatory
    resources in the drastically reduced approach area to Warsaw Pact
    nations. No small advantage that.</p>
  <p class="western">As the Navy sees it, the primary threats to its
    highly mobile carriers come from two sources: enemy air-launched or
    submarine-launched cruise missiles or torpedoes. Unfortunately, the
    optimally tight defensive fleet tactical deployment with respect to
    such conventional assault is completely at odds with the extensive
    fleet tactical dispersal required for defense against atomic attack,
    where blast effect <i>ALONE</i> compels a 20-mile separation. The
    alternatives appear to be the presentation of an attractive nuclear
    target, or an at least marginally vulnerable protective screen. The
    admittedly <i>peacetime</i> 21 Mar 1984 &ldquo;bump in the night&rdquo;
    of the carrier Kitty Hawk by a probably multiply-<i>killed</i>
    Soviet nuclear attack submarine is indicative of this dilemma, as
    the Russians hardly propose to attack our carriers by ramming.</p>
  <p class="western">Of course, who could <i>admit</i> that it might
    not have been the Kitty Hawk which ran down the Soviet sub? Beyond
    that, the Navy scenario altogether omits two vital considerations:
    (1) the enemy attack on our naval forces may well not occur against
    mobile fleets racing over boundless seas (Remember Pearl Harbor!);
    and (2) all arguments invoking a claim of unsinkability are moot in
    the face of a threatened drenching of the fleet by intensely
    radioactive water, rendering target vessels too hot to board for
    several days!</p>
  <p class="western">It&rsquo;s a whole new ballgame! We had best
    forget thinking in terms of conventional WWII sea warfare in an age
    of high-accuracy supersonic missiles, outer-space reconnaissance
    systems, and the elusive threat of nuclear-powered,
    nuclear-weapon-launching submarines &ndash; <i>PLUS</i> the enduring
    threat of unseen life-destroying gamma rays against which there is
    virtually no defense! Nor is this the end of the problem.
    High-altitude tests 800 miles from Hawaii caused the failure of
    street lighting in Honolulu by a phenomenon later termed
    electromagnetic pulse. This can damage electronic gear sufficiently
    to compel replacement.</p>
  <p class="western">Another problem is the so-called blackout of all
    signal frequencies within 500 miles of a one-megaton bomb for more
    than 10 hours! This means that aside from any physical damage
    incurred, an enemy could totally blind (electronically) our fleet
    (as well as its own) by the simple expedient of merely violating the
    nuclear test ban treaty without even contesting our fleets. At the
    same time, we have no real knowledge of a similar &ldquo;blue-out&rdquo;
    consequent to an underwater nuclear blast which might additionally
    render our fleet deaf as well as blind.</p>
  <p class="western">Of course, in the last analysis all arguments
    over the validity of strategic propositions (as, for example the
    questions of many-small vs. fewer-large carriers, or fewer-large
    carriers vs. multiple B-1s or MXs, or the current emphasis on
    carriers per se) are futile in the abstract. On the one hand, many
    experts assure us that the prospect of mutually assured destruction
    represented by current nuclear stockpiles serves as the ultimate
    deterrent to atomic warfare. On the other hand, can any battery of
    experts assure responsible planners that an enemy threatened with
    crushing defeat wouldn&rsquo;t resort to nuclear weapons <i>in
      extremis</i>? It all comes down to the dual questions of means and
    intent &ndash; potency and will &ndash; the will to use the means at
    hand.</p>
  <p class="western">Our defeat in Viet Nam is usually characterized
    as a failure of will, but then names like Hitler, Stalin, Khomeini,
    and Qaddafi come to mind. No faint hearts there! (Curiously, the
    name Richard Nixon also comes to mind. He may well turn out to be
    our most precious national resource, our secret weapon. As
    Machiavelli has said, &ldquo;The prince must be a lion, but he must
    also know how to play the fox.&rdquo; And they don&rsquo;t call
    Nixon &ldquo;Tricky Dicky&rdquo; for nothing. Erstwhile honcho
    Haldeman has characterized Nixon as &ldquo;crude, rough, &hellip;
    dirty, mean, &hellip; coldly calculating, devious, (and) craftily
    manipulative.&rdquo; Hey! If it takes one to know one, Nixon will do
    as our interpreter of an enemy psycho&rsquo;s intentions.)</p>
  <p class="western">But all of this is really beside the point: If
    nuclear war there is ever to be, the neutralizing of harbors by
    underwater atomic explosions <i>HAS</i> to be the most economic
    means for bottling up our naval opposition, and may well also be the
    most moral! One basic worry then remains: have our American planners
    taken the prospect of the possible nuclear neutralization of any or
    all of our vital harbors into account? Fortunately, such strategic
    considerations <i>never</i> were among my personal responsibilities.
    I just had to flesh them out here to present the &ldquo;big
    picture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Well now you can better understand the nature of
    the problem I was dealing with as long ago as 1948. Things were now
    radically different. What could and should ship machinery
    arrangement designers do about it? <i>This</i> was my job! I loved
    it! For machinery arrangement designs, the threat posed by nuclear
    weapons reduced itself to consideration of how to safeguard intact
    machinery spaces and associated personnel from the unconventional
    effects of nuclear explosions, or more specifically, how to preclude
    or minimize airborne radioactive residue from contaminating
    machinery spaces or personnel. This in turn reduced itself to a
    consideration of the provision of supercharged (compressed) air for
    boiler fuel oil combustion, and the provision of ventilating
    (breathing and cooling) air for personnel in otherwise completely
    buttoned up machinery spaces.</p>
  <p class="western">The problem anent combustion air was fairly
    easily accommodated by a simple redesign of the plenum chambers
    (from which boiler blowers take their suction) to incorporate
    airflow-path direction-reversing baffles. It helped that this was a
    closed-circuit air circulating system to which personnel are
    unexposed. The problem anent ventilation air became merely another
    factor in the solution of the problem of air contamination in
    general, as from the smoke and live steam usually released into
    conventionally damaged machinery spaces. The solution here was to
    provide a closed-circuit ventilation system for a fully enclosed
    central control station within each main machinery space, to which
    all operating personnel could retreat during battle. Accordingly,
    the <i>first</i> Main Engine Central Propulsion Control Station in
    the U.S. Navy (a somewhat similar station existed in Germany&rsquo;s
    <i>Prinz Eugen</i>) was incorporated in our first supercarrier, the
    CVA-59, <i>USS Forrestal</i>.</p>
  <p class="western">This was my design baby from start to finish, and
    my name is on that contract plan. It was so well received that I was
    then enlisted as an advisor on the control station in our first
    nuclear sub, then dubbed SSN-565. I&rsquo;ll never forget the
    meeting I attended on this, held in the conference room adjoining
    Admiral Rickover&rsquo;s office (though he did not attend). The
    meeting was chaired by one of Rickover&rsquo;s deputies, and an old
    PG classmate of mine, the earlier-mentioned Bob Hartwell &ndash; a
    genuine &ldquo;brain.&rdquo; Everybody held forth at great length,
    and the meeting was virtually over before I spoke at last, unable to
    contain myself any longer. I haven&rsquo;t the slightest
    recollection as to the point of contention, (though I do recall that
    I had consumed every document anent gamma ray shielding in
    Rickover&rsquo;s top-secret library in preparation for this
    meeting.) I also recall my performance as a highly emotional
    contention that their entire underlying philosophy was wrong, and I
    then proceeded to tick off point after point of a better approach to
    whatever the problem was. I concluded as suddenly as I has begun,
    and the room was deadly silent as Bob, seemingly almost awe-struck,
    solemnly intoned, &ldquo;Hatchet [my old USNA and PG nickname], I
    had <i>no idea</i> you were so smart!&rdquo; From Bob Hartwell this
    was no small accolade, indeed. (I sure wish I could remember what it
    was all about.)</p>
  <p class="western">This control station design project was really my
    cup of tea, and the responsibility was totally mine and involved no
    supervision and no design precedent or guidance criteria. The whole
    ball of wax was mine alone, from conception, through development, to
    completed contract plan. I&rsquo;ll try not to bore you with too
    many details (and I can hear your screams &ndash; &ldquo;Too late,
    already!&rdquo;) and, in fact, I don&rsquo;t even remember them. I
    would, however, like to give some sense of the scope of the project.</p>
  <p class="western">The objective was to provide a totally enclosed
    and self-sufficient control station adequate to sustaining the
    maximum feasible operating propulsion and electricity-generating
    plant despite every imaginable battle-damage scenario short of
    sinking. This meant you needed indicators of status throughout the
    entire plant, you needed controls through which to react to the
    whole range of possible indications, and, of course, you had to
    figure out the nature and extent of requisite communications
    facilities. It goes without saying that you also needed
    self-contained closed-circuit ventilation and air-cooling
    facilities, and that all provisions should be as efficiently
    arranged as possible and require the fewest operating personnel
    possible. It was a considerable chore.</p>
  <p class="western">I not only determined which phone and intercom
    circuits were required, but which stations should be connected on
    the various circuits, and who had best monitor what in the control
    station. I not only had to determine which gauges would be in the
    station, but how they could best be oriented with respect to each
    other, and how each gauge might optimally be mounted. (One of my
    ideas was that, despite how gauges were normally mounted with name
    plate data horizontal, they would be better oriented by rotating
    them prior to mounting so that the <i>normal</i> reading would in
    each case be a <i>vertically-upward indication</i>. Years later the
    Navy and others let expensive R &amp; D contracts so esoteric
    studies could be made on how best to design and mount gauges for
    optimal ease of interpretation under times of stress. Once again, I
    was 20 years too soon.)</p>
  <p class="western">Finally, precise details of the required remote
    controls had to be determined. This was one mean (but thoroughly
    enjoyed) assignment. When completed, there was virtually only <i>one</i>
    demand leveled by potential operators. Are you ready for this? They
    insisted on a porthole &ndash; <i>a window</i>! This despite the
    fact that some four to eight engineering spaces might be involved
    and at best they would have only a very limited view of one space
    which might well be smoke- or steam-filled! (I was amused to read
    years later that the original seven astronauts raised the same
    objection with respect to the Mercury capsule. &ldquo;The more
    things change, the more they remain the same.&rdquo;)</p>
  <p class="western">Moving right along (at last!), this was the year
    of the &ldquo;Admirals&rsquo; Revolt.&rdquo; It ostensibly began in
    Jun of 1949 when the Navy leaked a speech blistering the Air Force&rsquo;s
    projected B-36 bomber as &ldquo;a billion-dollar blunder.&rdquo;
    This action precipitated a full-blown Congressional investigation
    extending from Aug through Labor Day recess into late Oct. It was
    the biggest intra-service hassle since the Billy Mitchell uproar of
    the 1920s. To further exacerbate the situation, it was during this
    period, on or about 29 Aug 1949, that Russia exploded its first
    nuclear weapon. The root cause of this entire affair was the 23 Apr
    cancellation by then Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson of the
    Navy&rsquo;s projected first flush-deck supercarrier, the CVA-58.
    The unspoken heart of the matter was that this action took the Navy
    out of the nuclear warfare picture. It was as simple as that.</p>
  <p class="western">Without a nuclear weapons capability, the Navy &ndash;
    probably correctly &ndash; surmised that it would fast be relegated
    to a second-rate service role<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote53anc" href="#sdendnote53sym"><sup>53</sup></a>.
    In his Oct 1949 testimony, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General
    Omar Bradley, stated that we then had about 50 A-bombs, and
    estimated that 133 targeted on 70 Russian cities would &ldquo;do in&rdquo;
    the USSR, and that we expected to have 400 bombs by 1950, at which
    time the General estimated Russia might have 10 to 20. At the height
    of this ruckus, it became necessary to replace the Chief of Naval
    Operations, Louis Denfield, because he had already lost control of
    his Admirals and compromised his obligation to the then-new concept
    of service unification. Denfield was replaced by Admiral Forrest
    Sherman. Bradley characterizes Sherman as &ldquo;the most impressive
    military officer I have ever met in any service. Urbane,
    intellectual, diplomatic and smart as a whip&hellip;&rdquo; Well, I
    couldn&rsquo;t agree more, and that is the sole point of relevance
    for my introducing this episode into our story.</p>
  <p class="western">Naturally I had closely followed the public
    discussion of the issues as a matter of professional interest, the
    design of new naval vessels then being the source of our family
    income. I was well aware of the real basis of the controversy as
    well as the many (some potent) &ldquo;smoke-screen&rdquo;
    contentions on both sides. It was in this vein that I wrote Admiral
    Sherman a letter of congratulations &ndash; and <i>advice</i> &ndash;
    quoting some now unremembered dictum from <i>Reef Points</i> (the
    USNA&rsquo;s &ldquo;plebe bible&rdquo;) as a proper basis for
    proceeding. The upshot of all this was that I received an almost
    immediate phone call at work one day from Admiral Sherman&rsquo;s
    Chief of Staff, <i>offering me a job</i>! I <i>have</i> to agree
    with General Bradley, Sherman <i>was</i> smart as a whip!
    Fortunately for me, I (having gotten permanent job status on 10 Oct
    1949) declined this job offer because, unfortunately for Admiral
    Sherman, he had less than 2 years to a fatal heart attack. Perhaps
    even more fateful for me and my entire family at this time was that
    my sister, Margaret, got married on 26 Nov 1949. This was fateful
    because it entailed the &ldquo;breaking up&rdquo; of my mother&rsquo;s
    home with Margaret, and my mother thereupon (on 10 Dec 1949) moved
    in with my brother Tom and his wife for 74 (&ldquo;count &lsquo;em&rdquo;)
    days! It was just about this time (7 Dec 1949) that Chiang Kai-shek
    fled to Formosa (now Taiwan) as Mao established the Peoples Republic
    of China. Perhaps we&rsquo;d have been well advised to have fled
    also, because, on 22 Feb 1950, George Washington&rsquo;s birthday,
    my mother came to live with us on Dallas Avenue. So! This was what
    1950 was to be like!</p>
  <p class="western">This was the time of <i>Goodnight, Irene</i>; the
    declaration of the dogma of the Assumption by the Pope; the first
    time a TV audience (our own Baltimore&rsquo;s WMAR-TV) exceeded a
    radio audience; and the year St. Bernadette&rsquo;s rectory was
    completed. It was the time of the
    two-and-three-quarter-million-dollar Boston Brink&rsquo;s robbery;
    the time that Edward (Dr. Strangelove) Teller convinced Harry Truman
    to build an H-bomb 1,000 times more powerful than the A-bomb; and
    the time a second trial found alleged communist traitor Alger Hiss
    guilty of perjury and the judge gave him two years. This contrasts
    well with the 9 years another judge gave Klaus Fuchs for selling
    atomic secrets to the Russians only two months later. Well, Hiss and
    Fuchs weren&rsquo;t alone, Kathleen and I would be doing our time,
    too with mother. It wasn&rsquo;t to be long this first segment but
    it was no less traumatic for its relative briefness (compared with
    segments of home-staying-with-mother yet to come).</p>
  <p class="western">One example from this period might suffice.
    During mother&rsquo;s short sojourn at my brother&rsquo;s, I one day
    took George for his <i>first</i> hair-cut. Off went his longish
    golden locks, leaving almost a crew cut. I thought he looked cute &ndash;
    and all man &ndash; so on the way home I dropped in at Tom&rsquo;s
    to show him off to my mother. Well! She threw a foot-stomping,
    arm-flailing, mouth-foaming fit, and launched into a voluminous,
    venomous, vituperative tirade that was still in process even as
    George and I beat a hasty retreat to the door. Aunt Mary claims to
    this day that she has never heard anything like it before or since,
    in real life, in the movies or on TV. Everyone agrees it was such a
    livid, lurid lip-lashing that only a Tennessee Williams could
    possibly recreate it. Her virtuoso one-player performance was a
    veritable <i>tour de force</i> of Academy Award quality.</p>
  <p class="western">I got my first promotion, to GS-11, on 16 Apr
    1950, and now I&rsquo;d be earning the princely sum of $5,600 per
    year! Hey! The most my well-off father ever earned in his life was
    $6,000, and I can easily imagine my sons and daughters will well
    surpass my maximum earnings rate in their lifetime if, indeed, some
    of them haven&rsquo;t already. But money couldn&rsquo;t buy the
    sense of relief that came with my mother&rsquo;s vacating of our
    premises. Looking back now, I realize that my mother must have
    almost imperceptibly mellowed with the passing of years, but in the
    early 1950s she was surely at the peak of her powers of castigating
    criticism. (It frightens me somewhat to realize she would then have
    been about 62, whereas I&rsquo;m only 66 as I write this!)</p>
  <p class="western">North Korea invaded South Korea for the start of
    a 3-year war on 25 Jun 1950, but this was nothing like the invasion
    represented by the presence of my mother in our house. Fortunately
    for us, Martha put in an appearance on 29 Jul 1950, thereby
    complicating an already-crowded family situation. Martha would be
    our first to be born at Georgetown Hospital, and it&rsquo;s almost
    laughable, now, to reflect that Kathleen and I actually made a few
    practice runs from Dallas Avenue to Georgetown, just to be sure we
    could find it in a hurry at night. When the time finally came around
    0300 that Jul morning, naturally we found our car had a flat tire.
    So it was that we woke up our neighbor, Reuben Sanders, and he had
    the honor of driving her to Georgetown. So much for careful
    preparation!</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, and in addition to the intervention of
    Martha, God also intervened in Sep of 1950, sending my mother to the
    hospital with pneumonia, even as MacArthur was wading onto the
    beaches at Inchon in the last great amphibious landing of modern
    times. Anyhow, since Mom had originally gone to brother Tom&rsquo;s
    house when sister Margaret left on her honeymoon, and Margaret and
    Jimmy had now had an eight-month shakedown period to square away
    their married life, it was decided that Mom would return to their
    East-West Highway apartment rather than to our house upon her
    release from the hospital. Now all this might seem like no big deal
    to any readers of this epic tome, but it was a monumental relief to
    Kathleen and me. At the same time, it is a tremendous tribute to
    Margaret and Jimmy that the following 10 years of Life with Mother
    didn&rsquo;t wreck their marriage. To give one example of what a
    strain Mom was, whenever Jimmy was at home Mom would take her meals
    separately rather than join him and Margaret at the dinner table.
    Also, she&rsquo;d talk to Margaret as though Jimmy wasn&rsquo;t
    there. Some fun!</p>
  <p class="western">As 1950 drew to a close, and contrary to MASH&rsquo;s
    confusing of the Korean <i>police action</i> with the Viet Nam
    debacle as an <i>intrusion</i> into their lives, some 200,000
    Chinese suddenly <i>intruded</i> themselves across the Yalu River in
    late Nov, thereby turning an imminent victory into a near
    catastrophe. At almost the same time, two Puerto Rican would-be
    assassins tried to <i>intrude</i> into Blair House (where Harry
    Truman was then in residence while the White House was undergoing
    repairs), in the process killing two secret service agents. One of
    them was the father of some of our children&rsquo;s schoolmates at
    St. Bernadette&rsquo;s. Mom might be gone from Dallas Avenue, but
    there was still plenty of nastiness in the world. For another
    example, take the Rosenbergs. They were found guilty of treason on
    29 Mar 1951, even as Hiss was finally going to jail for perjury. On
    11 Apr Harry Truman was finally compelled to relieve MacArthur of
    his Korean command, and on 15 Apr the government gave me some relief
    when they promoted me to GS-12, which raised my salary to a
    monstrous $6,400!</p>
  <p class="western">I was getting deeper and deeper into the arcane
    science of machinery arrangement design, which I found increasingly
    fascinating. For example, I became (as far as I know) the first and
    only one ever to analytically reduce the determination of machinery
    space length to a more or less empirical science. I hear some of you
    asking, &ldquo;<i>Whatinhell</i> does <i>that</i> mean?&rdquo; I
    hear others of you expostulating (Look it up, if you have to. It&rsquo;s
    <i>not</i> a dirty word!), &ldquo;Who cares!&rdquo; Well, I did, and
    that carries a lot of weight with this storyteller. Preliminary hull
    design turns over a bare hull outline and an overall machinery box
    length to the machinery design branch. It then became our job to
    accommodate all requisite propulsion machinery and supporting
    electro-mechanical apparatus in this box &ndash; appropriately
    subdivided into a series of machinery spaces by watertight
    bulkheads. Incredible as it may seem (or <i>should</i> seem to any
    informed person), the machinery box had heretofore been arbitrarily
    subdivided into the individual fore and aft spaces by trial and
    error. I set out to evolve a method for predetermining the number
    and lengths of these individual spaces on a more rational basis.</p>
  <p class="western">In the long run my analyses produced two more
    articles for the <i>Journal of the American Society of Naval
      Engineers</i>. One was entitled <i>Longitudinal Stiffness of Naval
      Thrust Bearing Foundations</i>, and the other was called,
    <i>Permobility</i> &ndash;  <i>A New Criterion for Arrangement of
      Naval Machinery</i>. I could have written two others with titles
    like: <i>Naval Main Propulsion Reduction Gear Design Constants</i>,
    and <i>Main Propulsion System Condenser Scoop Design</i>. It is
    these appurtenances or <i>factors</i>, you see, that I found to be
    the delimiting parameters of machinery space proportioning.
    Incidentally, apart from my aforementioned articles, the so-called
    literature on the subject was virtually nonexistent. I expect the
    only reason my contributions didn&rsquo;t get more notoriety is that
    the fraternity of interest is exceedingly small. In any event, I
    didn&rsquo;t do the pieces for notoriety, or even money. The fact
    is, my evolving understanding or expertise in these matters was part
    and parcel of my job responsibility. And, as previously indicated, I
    then loved my work. I don&rsquo;t want to bore anyone too much, but
    I do think at least two brief quotes re the &ldquo;Permobility&rdquo;
    piece are warranted to give you some flavor regarding my work<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote54anc" href="#sdendnote54sym"><sup>54</sup></a>,
    thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Warship design is an interesting and highly
    advanced science, and any good marine library is full of technical
    literature on the subject. However, a review of this material soon
    discloses that very little information is available concerning the
    machinery arrangement aspects of combatant vessel design&hellip;
    This situation would seem to suggest that naval machinery
    arrangement is either an extremely simple or a very unimportant
    subject. However, it is difficult to reconcile either of the
    foregoing conclusions with current machinery arrangement practice.
    In the design of major combatant vessels it is customary to detail
    several dozen alternate machinery arrangements for purposes of
    comparative evaluation&hellip; The very number of such studies is
    indicative of the degree of importance accorded machinery
    arrangements. At the same time, the variety of arrangement solutions
    and the difficulty experienced in evaluating and selecting the
    optimum design serve to emphasize a lack of specific machinery
    arrangement objectives.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Again, the word &ldquo;permobility&rdquo;
    is intended to denote the characteristic of <i>permanent</i> or
    enduring vessel <i>mobility</i> as a function of the machinery
    arrangement in the face of always imminent, if not inevitable, war
    damage. At the same time, the term is intended to connote the battle
    endurance characteristics of the electrical power generating unit
    arrangements, in virtue of their vital relation not only to
    propulsion auxiliaries, but to the offensive weapons and damage
    control facilities in a ship. With this understanding of the term,
    it is easy to justify the contention that <i>permobility</i> should
    be the essential basis for evaluating alternate machinery
    arrangements. For example, in WWII, two out of every five vessels
    that were hit suffered propulsion damage, but only one out of every
    seven vessels suffering such damage was lost. On the other hand, two
    out of every three vessels that were immobilized were lost. It is
    thus obvious that <i>permobility</i> is not some abstract objective,
    but is fundamental to the continued usefulness and very existence of
    the ship itself.</p>
  <p class="western">Lest my meager reading audience O.D. on arcane
    machinery arrangement minutiae, suffice it to say that my conclusion
    was to the effect that <i>permobility</i> was the proper basis for
    machinery space compartmentation. Optimal compartmentation, in turn,
    became a problem of producing an arrangement that presented the
    least fore-and-aft length of machinery space per independent and
    self-sufficient propulsion unit, together with maximum possible
    separation of propulsion unit spaces within the overall machinery
    box length allotted by the hull designers. It should be evident,
    then, that the crucial element in all machinery plant layout design
    is the minimum possible length of propulsion unit space. My further
    analysis developed that the length of any given main propulsion unit
    machinery space was determined by a combination of the main turbine
    condenser scoop design, and the main propulsion shaft thrust
    bearing&rsquo;s longitudinal foundation plate. (I can almost hear
    the delighted chorus singing out, &ldquo;Obviously!&rdquo;)</p>
  <p class="western">Hey! Gimme a break! I&rsquo;m doing the best I
    can to indicate to you that I was an unsung pioneer in a virgin part
    of a fairly complex technical area. I&rsquo;ll try to be brief.
    First, I found an excellent article on scoop design in an old volume
    of some now-forgotten marine engineering journal. My main
    contribution here was twofold. I first of all took the lengthy,
    complex procedure therein presented and streamlined it into a highly
    simplified step-by-step procedure that even a non-engineer might
    follow in order to evolve the critical dimensions and overall
    outline of the scoop-injected main condenser salt water circulating
    system. In the second place, and of more significance, it was I who
    discovered or emphasized that it was precisely this feature of the
    design that was one of the two critical factors which fixed
    compartment length. The second factor, of course, was the main
    thrust bearing&rsquo;s longitudinal foundation plate. Here, too, I
    unearthed an article anent the mathematical complexity of
    determining the height, width, and &ndash; most importantly &ndash;
    the length of this plate.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, I know I have already lost some readers at
    this point in my epic (if not already long since!), and that even
    the survivors are by now extremely restless. Anyhow, here&rsquo;s
    the scoop (sorry!) on the foundation plate: You have a propeller in
    the water. It is developing, say in a WWII light cruiser, a
    30,000-horsepower forward thrust &ndash; this thrust being what
    drives the ship forward through the water. Now this propeller thrust
    has somehow to be transmitted to the hull of the vessel. This
    transmission of thrust occurs via (surprise!) a thrust bearing! It
    may help to consider the propeller shaft as having a fixed raised
    collar on it at some point, and that this collar rides against a
    similar collar fixed to the full of the ship. The interfacing of
    these two collars, separated by a highly compressed film of
    continuously cooled lubricating oil, is in effect the thrust
    bearing, through which the moving propeller&rsquo;s thrust is
    transmitted to the fixed hull. Well, now, 30,000 horsepower of
    thrust is a lot of thrust. It is therefore imperative that the
    collar that is fixed to the hull (and which absorbs and transmits
    all this thrust to the hull) be <i>firmly</i> anchored to the hull,
    and so anchored as to resist being rotated (or sheared) about a
    transverse axis by this immense thrust.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, this probability of rotation (or shear) is
    resisted by anchoring the thrust bearing (fixed collar) to a set of
    very substantial and <i>integral</i> fore-and-aft vertical girders,
    which are in turn securely anchored to a substantial expanse of the
    criss-cross, box-like girder construction which constitutes the
    hull, thereby absorbing or distributing the transmitted thrust over
    a substantial section of the honeycombed hull structure. The term
    &ldquo;integral&rdquo; as used above is intended to signify that
    these fore-and-aft foundation plates can&rsquo;t be cut, filleted,
    or pierced at any point to facilitate machinery arrangement or
    associated piping runs. To do their job, they must be solid,
    <i>integral</i>, uninterrupted girders. For watertight integrity
    purposes, they shouldn&rsquo;t penetrate any athwartship bulkhead.
    Being quite long, they thus become a critical factor in fixing the
    overall compartment length of a machinery space. OK! So you had a
    hunch about all this from the start.</p>
  <p class="western">Might I at this point inject just a word about
    reduction gears? (I hear no &ldquo;No!&rdquo;) Well, sometime around
    this period the Navy undertook a highly experimental design project
    known as DD828, the <i>USS Timmerman</i>. Heretofore (and
    thereafter) every new ship design was evolved in strict accordance
    with BuShips&rsquo; prepared contract design plans and detailed
    specifications. In the case of DD828 all specifications were waived
    on machinery components. Manufacturers were simply directed to pack
    the most power into the smallest and lightest package to which they
    would feel comfortable <i>affixing their nameplate</i>! They had to
    <i>guarantee nothing</i>! They merely had to publicly acknowledge
    that a particular component was theirs by so tagging it. This was a
    most revolutionary approach to attempting to squeeze as much as
    possible out of the then state of the art, free of all the normally
    stipulated specifications evolved over long years of actual
    experience.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, sizing equipment in advance under these
    circumstances was a real challenge indeed. A key criterion in the
    design of reduction gears, for example, is the so-called &ldquo;K-factor,&rdquo;
    a dimensionless coefficient that factors into the sizing of the
    elements of the reduction gear. Heretofore, many specifications
    would merely stipulate a smallish allowable range for this K-factor.
    How to size them, then, when this stipulation was waived? I almost
    inadvertently hit upon the solution in perusing a copy of the
    <i>Journal of the Society of Automotive Engineers</i>. An article
    presented a curve depicting bearing loading vs. transmitted
    horsepower for various oil viscosities. It was a simple matter for
    me to convert SAE viscosities into Navy viscosities, and to
    extrapolate the horsepower range markedly higher. I then refashioned
    the bearing loading scale to corresponding K-factors known by
    experience to have been acceptable. I astounded everyone by almost
    precisely predicting the uncommonly small size of Timmerman&rsquo;s
    reduction gears. It was simple using my adjusted curve. What was the
    basis for my effecting this translation? I simply figured that an
    oil film wouldn&rsquo;t know whether it separated teeth on meshing
    gears or a journal in a bearing shell. Some people might call this
    &ldquo;insight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">OK! So I&rsquo;ve already said too much! But,
    <i>somebody</i> has to know this. And think how you can amaze your
    friends by explaining such things when they come up (as they surely
    must) in bull sessions at bars or parties. Also, are you ever ready
    for quiz shows! Be that as it may, this <i>was</i> my life, guys,
    and that&rsquo;s what this story is supposed to be about. Still, the
    world was moving on, <i>thrusting</i> (as it were) into the future.
    On 10 Jul 1951 negotiations on a Korean armistice began. (They were
    to continue for two years!) As of 29 Jul 1951 our family numbered
    four children ranging in age from 7 to 1 year old so there was
    plenty of incentive for work. On 4 Sep 1951 Harry Truman inaugurated
    transcontinental TV with his speech to the United Nations Conference
    then in progress in San Francisco.</p>
  <p class="western">On 8 Sep 1951 the US-Japanese peace treaty was
    finally signed, also in San Francisco. In Nov my last ship,
    Bremerton, was reactivated for Korean duty. She was to be awarded
    two battle stars for her efforts. Then came 1952: Presidential
    Candidate Adlai Stevenson was pictured with a hole in his shoe.
    Brigitte Bardot&rsquo;s pictures suggested a hole in the head. Ike
    defined an intellectual as &ldquo;a man who takes more words than
    are necessary to say more than he knows.&rdquo; Harry Belafonte was
    busy inventing (he thinks) calypso. One popular song became &ldquo;On
    Top of Old Smokey,&rdquo; but singer Johnny Ray garnered the first
    one-million-sales record with his hit, &ldquo;Cry.&rdquo; On 6 Feb
    1952 Queen Elizabeth was crowned, but our efforts of the year were
    crowned on 24 Aug with the birth of our #3 son, John Joseph.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">John didn&rsquo;t
    realize it, of course, but his birth was paralleled by such worldly
    events as the birth of the <i>Mouseketeers</i> and <i>Winky Dink</i>.
    But even John Wright wasn&rsquo;t the biggest noise of 1952. That
    would have been the 1 Nov (31 Oct per EST) explosion off Eniwetok of
    our first hydrogen bomb. Then we were into 1953. Stalin died 5 Mar
    1953, to be succeeded (as premier) by Khrushchev. On 29 May 1953
    Edmund Hillary topped Mt. Everest. On 19 Jun the Rosenbergs were
    finally executed, and the Korean armistice finally was effected on
    26 Jul &ndash; three days before Martha&rsquo;s third birthday. As
    with John&rsquo;s birthday, Martha&rsquo;s was soon saluted by an
    H-bomb explosion, this one unfortunately by the Russians, on 12 Aug
    1953. We thus approached 1954 with the Cold War in full force.</p>

    Family 26 December 1952 &ndash; George 8, JJ 4 months</h3>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">Many people will
    remember 1954 as the year <i>Amahl and the Night Visitors</i> made
    its Christmas Eve TV debut. George was then 9, Anne 6, and Charlie
    5. Older folks may remember it as the year &ldquo;Old Blue Eyes&rdquo;
    Sinatra made it big with a song called &ldquo;Young at Heart,&rdquo;
    but John (who was only 2 at the time) should remember it as the year
    that Blessed Dominic Savio was canonized. John, you see, was to get
    in really big trouble later on with a St. Bernadette&rsquo;s nun
    when he had the bold-as-brass temerity to mark up a holy card of
    Blessed Dom with a mustache and eyeglasses. Shame, John! But life
    went on. In Jan we launched our first atomic submarine, Hugh Hefner
    launched <i>Playboy</i>, Alfred E. Newman popularized <i>Mad
      Magazine</i>, and <i>McCalls</i> magazine launched a theme of
    &ldquo;togetherness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">This was the period, too, when &ldquo;in&rdquo;
    folks suddenly found it possible to expand their vocabularies
    effortlessly but enormously by simply appending a mere four letters
    to their nouns, as in fashion-wise, economy-wise, and sports-wise.
    The English language still hasn&rsquo;t recovered. This was also the
    year that Captain Queeg made his appearance in <i>The Caine Mutiny</i>.
    It was also the time Mary Bernadette made her appearance on 20 Feb
    1954. In view of her affiliation today, it&rsquo;s interesting to
    note that the Air Force Academy made its appearance almost
    concurrently with Mary&rsquo;s advent, opening its doors (sorry,
    Mary!) on April Fool&rsquo;s Day 1954. As the highlight event of the
    year, Mary&rsquo;s birth had to compete with such significant
    happenings as the 2 May French defeat at Dien Bien Phu by Ho Chi
    Minh (and our eventually consequent disastrous involvement in Viet
    Nam), and the Supreme Court ordered desegregation of our public
    schools on 17 May 1954. So much, then for a flavor of the times.</p>

    Mary <i>will</i> be heard from &ndash; March 1954</h3>
  <p class="western">The world wasn&rsquo;t the only thing that was
    moving right along then. In Jun of 1954 my mother (still living with
    Aunt Margaret and Uncle Jimmy) began what would become a series of 5
    moves over the next 6 years, as they moved from their apartment on
    East-West Highway to a rental home (around the corner from what
    would become our future home on Kinross Ave.) on Harding Place. It
    was at this time that Kathleen and I, not having enough to do with
    my job or raising six children, entered into a St. Bernadette&rsquo;s
    study club comprising us, the Ungers, the Bernards, and several
    other forgotten couples. This group met weekly during the school
    season over the next three years, holding meetings from house to
    house. First we took up a study of the origin and significance of
    various parts of the mass, then we took up the study of Pope Pius
    XII&rsquo;s encyclical Mediator Dei (on the sacred liturgy), and
    finally we turned to a study of selected saints.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">For each session
    we would rotate the chairmanship of the meeting, with that person
    making a prepared pitch after which a general discussion would
    ensue. Wouldn&rsquo;t you know that our mild but naturally
    intimidating pastor, Fr. Stricker, would choose to monitor a session
    held at our Dallas Avenue home &ndash; and one at which I was to be
    the pitchman! My subject was St. Thomas Aquinas. As you might
    imagine, &ldquo;<i>EVERYTHING</i> you &lsquo;d <i>EVER</i> want to
    know about St. Thomas was <i>IN THAT PITCH!</i>&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t
    know what Fr. Stricker had expected, but he was surprised. In fact,
    the next issue of our monthly parish bulletin, <i>The Echo<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote55anc" href="#sdendnote55sym"><sup>55</sup></a></i>,
    contained a short item by the pastor testifying to his surprise and
    enjoyment over participation in a parish study club meeting at which
    he confessed he learned much. I still consider that one of the best
    tributes I have ever received, for Fr. Stricker was nothing if not
    an outstanding scholar. (I don&rsquo;t mean to imply that I was
    brilliant &ndash; a possibility, of course &ndash; but merely that I
    was always fully <i>prepared</i>.)</p>

    With Anne at Hains Point &ndash; June 1954</h3>
  <p class="western">Lest we be overwhelmed by my strengths, let me
    hasten to confess that this was also the point at about which a
    period of weakness first manifested itself. Not much shall be said
    about all this. As Sergeant Joe Friday might have said, &ldquo;All
    names and details shall be omitted to protect the innocent.&rdquo;
    Suffice it to say, after all these years I suddenly started to
    notice other women. Be warned, my dear children, that the middle
    years can beget strain. Contrasting forces are at work. The husband
    is essentially job-focused while the wife can understandably become
    increasingly children-focused, perhaps even to the detriment of the
    husband. Indeed, in our case, some very trying times would ensue.</p>
  <p class="western">Our present happily married state wasn&rsquo;t
    achieved without pain and struggle. As one confessor at the time
    encouraged me, &ldquo;Take heart in the fact that the Devil is smart
    and only devotes his time to those he thinks might be his best
    catches. He therefore particularly targets good husbands and
    fathers.&rdquo; Another positive aspect of this much-rued lapse was
    that it cured me (I hope) of any inclination to or pretense of
    self-righteous pride. Never again could I look down my nose at
    others&rsquo; apparent weaknesses. Let&rsquo;s just conclude by
    saying, &ldquo;We <i>did</i> make it through this night.&rdquo;
    Beyond that, as Plutarch has said, &ldquo;It is a point of wisdom to
    be silent when occasion requires.&rdquo; Frankly, I&rsquo;d have
    much rather not even mentioned this, but honesty and fairness to the
    record compelled it.</p>
  <p class="western">The end of 1954 ushered in our eight-passenger
    DeSoto ex-airport limousine, with the pull-down seats, and ushered
    out Joe McCarthy by way of Senate censure even as, ironically, Alger
    Hiss was being released from 3-and-1/2 years in jail for perjury.
    Meanwhile, on the family front, we had instituted a new
    Christmas-gift-wrapping tradition. After all, we now had three
    children at age six or over. Do any of our children remember? I&rsquo;d
    take you, one at a time, into a bedroom, and there George would be
    allowed to wrap Anne&rsquo;s presents, and then Anne would be
    allowed to wrap George&rsquo;s. This was designed to let the
    children share in the excitement of surprising one another, but I
    wonder &hellip; were you guys really able to keep such secrets from
    each other?</p>
  <p class="western">In any event, our M.O. certainly wasn&rsquo;t
    anything fancy. We started off by wrapping the gifts in newspaper,
    so the nature of the gift couldn&rsquo;t be read through the
    Christmas tissue with which we ultimately re-wrapped them. However,
    we soon dispensed with the bother of even adding the more decorative
    tissue covering. The children didn&rsquo;t seem to mind, and it sure
    saved both time and money. To complete the job, we&rsquo;d merely
    scrawl the recipient&rsquo;s name on the package with a bright
    crayon. No fancy name tags or stickers for us. So, the base of our
    Christmas tree would be soon lost in an unsightly mound of
    newspaper-covered blobs of varying sizes. I can almost hear Pat
    Brady exclaiming as I write, &ldquo;Oh, No! That&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo;
    Hey, Pat! It just goes to show: it&rsquo;s the thought that&rsquo;s
    important.</p>

    1951 DeSoto Limo<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote56anc" href="#sdendnote56sym"><sup>56</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">Thus dawned the year 1955. This was to be a
    pivotal year in many respects. It was the year of the Salk vaccine,
    the push-button phone, vinyl floors, auto-train, air-conditioned
    buses, stereo FM, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s &ldquo;all deliberate
    speed&rdquo; integration order, the Warsaw Pact, the deposing of
    Juan Peron in Argentina, the merger of the AFL and CIO. It was also
    the year that a Miss Rosa Parks chose to sit down on a bus in
    Montgomery, Alabama, and the fateful year that the U.S. agreed to
    send some advisors to help train Viet Nam forces. For me, it was the
    year I moved on into a new job, transitioning from the Bureau of
    Ships&rsquo; Machinery Design Division to its Fleet Maintenance
    Division.</p>
  <p class="western">This entailed my elevation to GS-13 at the
    magnificent salary of $8,360 per annum! I was also now designated a
    <i>General Engineer</i> in lieu of my previous classification as a
    <i>Marine Engineer</i>. The change was timely. I loved my work in my
    old billet, but I had by then virtually exhausted its possibilities.
    By then I had reduced every aspect of sizing equipment to a science.
    I had carefully developed and detailed design parameters for
    turbines, pumps, compressors, valves, motors, generators,
    condensers, evaporators, tanks, reduction gears, bearings, shafting,
    piping, boiler, you-name-it. I had literally worked myself out of a
    job and was starting to get a little bored by lack of challenge. Not
    only that, there was no upward mobility in my present organization.</p>
  <p class="western">Even should one of the three people who outranked
    me die or transfer out of the section, my experience and
    qualifications were not a match for the job requirements of their
    billets, which were more oriented to supervising draftsmen. So, I
    had to move on, but there was a certain amount of regret. After all,
    it had been a most pleasant and rewarding seven-year association. In
    any event, move on I did, transferring from Code 434 (Machinery
    Arrangements) to Code 518 (Ship Improvements) on 27 Feb 1955.
    Significantly, this seemingly innocuous switch also marked a
    dramatic change from a passive off-line planning office to a dynamic
    on-line real-time office! So ended the first segment of my civilian
    employment. We then had six children, ranging from 11-year-old
    George to one-year-old Mary, and Kathleen was already carrying
    someone who would become known as KT.</p>

      XIV. OPERATIONS</h2>
  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western"><i>The only way to get rid of
    responsibilities is to discharge them.</i> <span style="font-style: normal">&ndash;&nbsp;Walter&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Robertson</span></p>
  <p class="western">The mid-to-late 1950s was a period of
    high-anxiety living, a consequence of the so-called <i>Cold War</i>,
    which was very chilling indeed. Lots of our friends and neighbors
    were building bomb shelters on their property, and the fire
    department even designated a fallout-shelter area in what it deemed
    to be the safest corner of our house. We also laid in a modest stock
    of emergency rations (which I recall comprised lots of peanut
    butter, crackers, and chocolate bars among other staples). We also
    stashed a first aid package that included vitamin C for radiation.
    Everyone did the best they could, but overall remained rather
    fatalistic. Mike Todd tried to distract everyone by his lavish
    fantasy evolved from Jules Verne&rsquo;s <i>Around The World In
      Eighty Days</i>. In Mar 1955 the nation (less us, of course)
    tuned-in the first coast-to-coast <i>color</i> TV program.</p>
  <p class="western">This was the period when the all-consuming
    anguish of the general public quickly made <i>Dear Abby</i> a
    household name. Those great popular philosophers, the beer salesmen,
    trumpeted the great tidings that, &ldquo;Where there&rsquo;s life,
    there&rsquo;s Bud.&rdquo; (I&rsquo;ll bet Gary wishes he&rsquo;d
    said that!) A short time later they were urging us to &ldquo;Grab
    all the gusto you can, because you only go around once in life!&rdquo;
    <i>WOW!</i> No! <i>Double WOW!</i> The great symbol of the times was
    the Frisbee &ndash; not yet recognized as an art form worthy of a
    college major at those really &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; institutions of
    higher learning that seemingly infest only Florida and southern
    California. In short, there was an awful lot of tension in the air
    in those days, and the public response was generally one of false
    bravado compounded by the frantic pursuit of pure escapism. You
    simply refused to think about nuclear bombs and fallout shelters.
    Life could still be beautiful, if only you just closed your eyes.</p>
  <p class="western">Of course neither Kathleen nor I could afford to
    close our eyes. We were both much too busy: her with the children,
    me with mastering the responsibilities and duties of a new job. We
    really just didn&rsquo;t have time to sit around wringing our hands
    over the precarious balance of terror then governing world affairs.
    Really, it was sort of like a cross between living in a trance and
    being in &ldquo;never-never land.&rdquo; It was all kind of unreal.
    The times impelled a deepening religious awareness on the part of
    thinking adults, and our continuing study club involvement testifies
    to our participation in that general trend. Still, we both had a job
    to do, so we just kept marching ever forward into a rather
    threatening future, but relatively serene in our faith.</p>
  <p class="western">I reported to the Fleet Maintenance Division of
    the Bureau of Ships, Code 518,on 27 Feb 1955. My new boss was a
    &ldquo;blue and gold&rdquo; type, a Captain Gaasterland. He was a
    semi-portly but highly flamboyant figure who affected a cigarette
    holder &aacute; la FDR, with swagger to match. He was, all in all,
    an above-average naval executive, and worthy of respect. His
    greatest trait, so far as I was concerned, was his flair for
    delegating responsibility with matching authority. He simply gave me
    my head &ndash; turned me loose. It&rsquo;s interesting to note,
    too, that like my first civilian job in the Design Division, this
    job was a newly created job that had never before existed. So, once
    again, I got to plow virgin ground.</p>
  <p class="western">What fantastic good fortune! I was bound by no
    precedents. I could write my own rules, and I did. In the first
    several weeks I didn&rsquo;t do anything but analyze my job
    requirements, thoroughly study and absorb all relevant directives
    pertaining to it (and there was a substantial and complex literature
    on the subject area), and then plan precisely how I would go about
    getting the job done. This will require a little elaboration, so
    once again I must ask any persevering readers to bear with me. A
    brief of my job description might run thus:</p>
  <p class="western">As a Supervising General Engineer, review on a
    continuing basis <i>all</i> ship improvement projects as the Senior
    Administrator of the Ship Alteration Program. Analyze military,
    mechanical-electrical, and structural aspects of all proposed
    projects, as well as potential impact on planned programs. Exercise
    complete authority for funding the <i>$100 million per year</i>
    program; and for approving, disapproving, or canceling ship
    improvement proposals; and for <i>establishing their priority.</i></p>
  <p class="western">This, boys and girls, was one helluva job. To
    begin with, you can&rsquo;t imagine the complexity of the ship
    improvement process as evolved by minions laboring in the Chief of
    Naval Operations&rsquo; &ldquo;Puzzle Palace&rdquo; in the Pentagon.
    First, a ship improvement proposal was passed up the line through
    the type-commander chain in the Forces Afloat. It then had to be
    hacked by the various technical branches in the appropriate
    headquarters bureaus (such as Bu Ships, BuOrd, BuAer, etc.). Every
    item also had to be evaluated in terms of technical validity,
    weight, and moment considerations, and habitability (a forerunner,
    you might say, of the environmental impact statement). If it passed
    these hurdles, and cost-efficiency analyses, then the item was
    introduced as an item in the SIG (ship improvement guide). A SIG
    item then ran the gauntlet of reviews by Bureau Type Desks for
    consideration in various CIP&rsquo;s (class improvement plans) for
    various vessel types. Once an item was approved for inclusion in a
    CIP, a formal ShipAlt then had to be issued for that improvement in
    that particular class of vessels.</p>
  <p class="western">Next a determination had to be made whether the
    ShipAlt was a military or an ordinary alteration, as these were
    distinctly separate listings with different fund sources. So far, so
    good. This was an already established procedure of much greater
    complexity than indicated through this brief sketch. Now, this is
    where I came in &ndash; I was to first determine the <i>criteria for
      determining the priority of competing improvement projects</i>, and
    then I was to <i>assign the priority for each and every improvement
      project</i>. That having been done, my office then established the
    cut-off point for funding the suite of ShipAlts to be accomplished
    on particular ships as they underwent their periodic shipyard
    overhauls. Mr. Kim was my funding officer &ndash; my bookkeeper, if
    you will. This, remember, was a $100-million-a-year program &ndash;
    pretty big stuff in the 1950s.</p>
  <p class="western">So my very first order of business (and
    ultimately, I suppose, my major claim to fame) in this job was to
    evolve a basis for fixing ShipAlt priorities. It was fortunate that
    at that time I was deep into St. Thomas Aquinas in pursuit of my
    avocation &ndash; a fascination with theology. As I believe I have
    already mentioned, the theology of St. Thomas is rampant with fine
    <i>distinctions</i>. His conclusions are generally evolved by a
    process of elimination, the essence of which is drawing
    distinctions. (I was always fond of pointing out in my speeches how
    a simple &ldquo;S&rdquo; alone distinguished the cosmic from the
    comic, and a simple &ldquo;I&rdquo; distinguished poise from pose.
    (Well! It held people&rsquo;s attention.)</p>
  <p class="western">More than that, St. Thomas&rsquo;s work reflects
    a hierarchical structure in which things are ordered in terms of a
    certain inherent precedence arising from ultimate goals. Thus, for
    example, he proceeds along the line that the world is intelligible
    only in terms of its relation to man, man is intelligible only in
    terms of his relation to God, and God is intelligible only in terms
    of Himself. So, in effect, my absorption in St. Thomas at that time
    also proved to be a boon to my job-related efforts of devising
    priority criteria &ndash; my mind was fully in gear for analytical
    exercises. (Can you imagine my trying to explain to my fellow
    technicians at the Bureau that my priority scheme was evolved after
    the manner of St. Thomas Aquinas?)</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, this was the way I proceeded. Thus it was
    that my first order of priority became those alterations which would
    directly enhance the immediate <i>safety</i> of the whole <i>ship</i>,
    that is, the safeguarding of the entire crew &ndash; for example,
    installation of search radar. The next order of priority became
    those alterations which could directly enhance the immediate <i>safety</i>
    of an <i>individual</i> human being &ndash; for example, a device
    that would automatically disengage a high-voltage power supply when
    the cover was removed from some electrical apparatus. Then, of
    course, military improvements took precedence over ordinary
    improvements, and offensive military improvements took precedence
    over defensive improvements. Thus is was that, step by step, I
    evolved an entire array of priority categories.</p>
  <p class="western">So far I was operating completely independently,
    evolving the priority category list entirely on my own, and it was
    sufficiently comprehensive that each and every improvement project
    on the books could easily be slotted into one or another of these
    categories. The next phase of the process was to actually review all
    existing ship improvement projects, assign them to the proper
    category, and then order their relative priority within categories.
    For this part of the job I was to have what was euphemistically
    called &ldquo;help.&rdquo; Actually, coincident with the
    establishment of my new billet, the Chief, BuShips, chartered a
    so-called <i>Fleet Improvement Council</i> (FIC). This was to be an
    advisory body charged specifically with assigning ShipAlt
    priorities. The FIC was to be composed of representatives from each
    of the type desks and certain allied technical desks, specifically:
    Codes 522 (Carriers), 523A (Battleships), 523B (Cruisers), 523C
    (Destroyers), 525 (Mine &amp; Amphib Craft), 526 (Submarines), 527
    (Auxiliaries), 529 (Yard &amp; Patrol Craft), 736 (Shipyard Overhaul
    Scheduling), and 990 (Electronics). My job description provided that
    I (representing Code 518, Fleet Improvement Programs) would be
    Chairman of the FIC.</p>
  <p class="western">Each Type desk, of course, had direct input from
    its corresponding Type Commander (afloat). In due course I called
    for the first meeting of the FIC to set about our formidable task. I
    immediately ran into deep trouble. I had scarcely opened the meeting
    when the deputy for Capt. Gaasterland (my boss), a certain Cdr. Hank
    Kittendorf, a precocious if plodding Prussian if there ever was one,
    and only an ostensible observer, attempted to take over the meeting
    to make a policy speech. I called for an immediate halt in the
    proceedings, admonished the good Commander (also my ostensible boss)
    that he was merely an observer with no right to speak, and
    threatened to adjourn the meeting if he opened his mouth again.
    Well, one didn&rsquo;t normally and publicly treat one&rsquo;s boss
    this way, and the mouth of every attendee was fully agape. The
    Commander, taken aback, sat down somewhat stunned. We proceeded, but
    only for a moment. Cdr. Kittendorf started sounding off again. I
    immediately adjourned the meeting, to the consternation of all
    present.</p>
  <p class="western">This was vitally necessary if ever I was to
    function as an effective chairman of the FIC, the very function of
    which was itself charged with an abundance of controversy and
    competition. Not only that, it turned out that every FIC member
    out-ranked me in grade, most of them being the head of their
    respective division. This dynamic initial action of my part,
    however, clearly established my authority once and for all. At the
    next meeting I publicly apologized to an <i>absent</i> Cdr.
    Kittendorf &ndash; my concession to Capt.. Gaasterland in exchange
    for Kittendorf&rsquo;s future absence. <i>Nobody</i> else on the
    council ever challenged me.</p>
  <p class="western">So the work began at last. We established two
    lists: a list of military ship improvements, and a list of
    &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; (non-military) improvements. Then, you might
    think, some further sub-division might be required. How, for
    example, should search radar in a carrier rank with respect to
    search radar in, say, a cruiser. Actually, this type of question
    didn&rsquo;t in fact arise, as may become clearer as we proceed. The
    important (amazing?) thing at this point is that I was able to sell
    my priority scheme virtually without change both to shore-side
    military honchos, in both the technical Bureaus and the office of
    the Chief of Naval Operations, and to the Type Commanders of all the
    Forces Afloat. Beyond that, our smoothly functioning FIC then
    generated our two priority listings. It was a job well done. In
    fact, I was officially <i>commended</i> by the Chief of the <i>Office
      of Naval Research</i>, Admiral Rawson Bennett, for my &ldquo;unbiased
    and objective development of alteration priorities for FY1956.&rdquo;
    Then, in Feb 1957 I was <i>commended</i> by the Chief, Bureau of
    Ships, for &ldquo;improved administration of the ShipAlt program.&rdquo;
    This recital doesn&rsquo;t begin to indicate the sheer force of
    confident leadership demanded for this task.</p>
  <p class="western">The truly amazing thing about all the foregoing,
    of course, was that &ndash; a dozen years after WWII had ended &ndash;
    <i>this had never been done before</i>. In fact, this had been
    perhaps the major problem in the Bureau of Ships. The shore-side
    Admirals there were constantly having their feet held to the fire by
    the Forces Afloat Type Commanders for the chaotic and inequitable
    administration of the overall Fleet Improvement Program. It was
    precisely to rectify this huge problem that I was hired. (Me! It
    boggles the mind, doesn&rsquo;t it! Here I was, a fugitive from the
    &ldquo;blue and gold&rdquo; in effect telling the Admirals at sea
    what to do!)</p>
  <p class="western">You have to understand that this was an immensely
    complex business. For example, electronics was just coming into its
    own, mushrooming overnight. Worse than that, <i>acquisition</i>
    funds and <i>installation</i> funds came from two separate
    appropriations. The former were lumped with continuing <i>new
      construction</i> funds which were then in good supply. The latter
    were lumped with annual <i>operational</i> funds which were always
    relatively on a shoe-string basis. Thus it was that we literally had
    shipyards with warehouses full of fairly new electronic gear (being
    pushed by the Chief of Naval Research) for which there simply was a
    dearth of installation funds. This being peacetime, the Forces
    Afloat didn&rsquo;t give a damn about overloading their ships with
    still highly fragile electronics gear requiring highly skilled
    maintenance.</p>
  <p class="western">So the Type Commanders would lobby the Bureau for
    more mundane improvements like dishwashers in the galley, more
    reliable liberty boats, and the like. So the electronic gear stayed
    on the shelves in the shipyards. Well, my priority ordering put an
    end to these shore-against-sea-commander squabbles. The &ldquo;squeaking
    wheel no longer got all the grease,&rdquo; &ndash; the order of
    doing business was pre-ordained. And, thanks to my interpreting
    search radar as a device enhancing overall ship safety, they went to
    the top of the list and started moving off the shipyard shelves.</p>
  <p class="western">Next you have to understand a little about the
    complexity of the ship overhaul process. Every ship in the navy is
    overhauled at periodic intervals, the intervals varying for
    different ship types. Thus, the schedule of overhauls could be
    extrapolated several years into the future. Thus we could be
    certain, say 1 Jan, that USS Superboomer would be undergoing
    overhaul on 1&ndash;24 October. More than that, we would know that
    the overhaul would occur at Podanka Shipyard, because Podanka was
    the assigned home port of Superboomer. Well, the overhaul comprises
    two worklists. The repair list is the product of the Type Commander
    afloat, with input from the ship itself, and it is funded by the
    Type Commander. The alteration list was the product of the Type Desk
    in the Bureau, funded by my office (only Mr. Kim could authorize
    funds) through a cut-off point established my me. This suite of
    ShipAlts was communicated by the Type Desk, via a funds endorsement
    by my office, to the overhauling shipyard (with copy to the ship and
    Type Commander afloat) by the so-called 120-day letter, which
    indicated that it reached all hands 120 days in advance of the
    scheduled start of the overhaul.</p>
  <p class="western">The complexity doesn&rsquo;t end here. Each ship
    also has a designated planning yard which is charged with
    responsibility for developing and delivering both installation plans
    and the requisite materials to the installing yard by the date of
    the overhaul. So the process requires the dovetailing of the arrival
    of the ship, plans, material, and authorization and funding at the
    shipyard by the requisite date, concurrent with delivery of the
    repair list and associated funds from the Type Commander afloat.
    Well, has a light gone on in your brain yet? One sure went on in
    mine. After all, all of this complex planning was implemented <i>BY
      HAND</i>! I found this unbelievable. I knew the Navy had electronic
    punch-card equipment everywhere, adapting it to inventory control
    and payroll functions. I knew, too, that the Navy was beginning to
    invest heavily in newly developing electronic computers. Now! See
    how my job naturally led me first to look into and then transition
    into the electronic computer field?</p>
  <p class="western">We&rsquo;re getting ahead of our story though.
    Getting from here to there wasn&rsquo;t quite that simple. I was
    working prodigious hours, sometimes spending entire weekends in the
    office around budget time, and often working with Mr. Kim until
    three in the morning, trying to price-out our alteration lists to
    establish an equitable cut-off point that could be sustained through
    an entire year. At home we still managed to steal a family day here
    and there at Mayo Beach. (It got so we could change a fan belt on
    the Corvair station wagon in less than 15 minutes.) Some children
    may be able to place this time by noting that in July 1955 Fr. Cieri
    was replaced by Fr. Bonfiglio at St. Bernadette&rsquo;s. On 31 Aug
    <i>False-alarm</i> KT made her last of many appearances in
    Georgetown Hospital. Uncle Tom drove Kathleen to the hospital, this
    happening occurring in an afternoon for a change, while I was still
    at work. My job so absorbed me that before we knew it we were well
    into 1956. In April my mother moved with Margaret and her family
    again, this time from Harding Place to Bieber Place. We didn&rsquo;t
    quite realize it at first, but they evidently were having problems
    with the rent. This business was to get worse. In July the <i>Andrea
      Doria</i> sank off the North Carolina coast, and Egypt seized the
    Suez Canal. This must have been about the summer we all packed off
    to a week or so at Rehoboth Beach, with Mr. Kim and my Aunt Ruth
    along for the fun.</p>

    KT at 5 days &ndash; 5 September 1955</h3>
  <p class="western">Our family numbered seven children then, with
    two-year-old Mary still in playpen limbo, and not quite one-year-old
    KT still being crib-bait. George was eleven and John was just about
    four. With that number and the low age-range, we could never have
    done this without Mr. Kim and Aunt Ruth. This was the time when Kim
    demonstrated how to surf by merely wetting a mattress cover, running
    along the beach to billow it full of air, and then securing the open
    end with string. He would then ride the inflated mattress cover onto
    the beach like a surfboard. He was a sight to behold. A lifeguard
    finally made him desist &ndash; not because he didn&rsquo;t know
    what he was doing, but probably because it might give ideas to
    youngsters who couldn&rsquo;t handle it. This was also the time Aunt
    Ruth taught us to play pinochle, and we adults (Kathleen and I, Kim
    and Aunt Ruth) would have a big game every evening at the kitchen
    table after the youngsters were put to bed. Kim, of course, provided
    an extra family lifeguard at Oceanside, and Aunt Ruth provided a
    live-in babysitter. A fine time was had by all &ndash; a most unique
    family vacation.</p>
  <p class="western">In the fall of 1956 (on 23 Oct), we moved from
    Dallas to Kinross Avenue. This time we had a real mover, but I have
    no recollections about the details &ndash; other than the three boys
    and I each taking a leg of our swing set and walking from house to
    house down the middle of Lanark Way, and Mary sitting on the upper
    level stairs and crying that she wanted &ldquo;to go home now&rdquo;
    at bedtime. The Hungarian revolt broke out the day we moved and was
    all over by 4 Nov. This was also the period when I staged my own
    revolt in the Fleet Maintenance Division of BuShips. I call it my
    <i>Yamamoto Caper</i>.</p>
  <p class="western">I refer to an incident <i>just fifty-one days
    before Pearl Harbor</i>, when the Chief of Staff of the First Air
    Fleet, RAdm. Kusaka, contested with Yamamoto, the Commander in
    Chief, about who would be calling the shots. Kusaka fired off a
    message: &ldquo;CinC, did you not assure me that the details of this
    plan would be placed under my supervision and every possible effort
    would be made to meet my requirements for the operation?&rdquo;
    Yamamoto immediately replied via the Senior Staff Officer, Combined
    Fleet: &ldquo;Adm. Yamamoto insists that his plan be adopted. I am
    authorized to state that if it is not, then the CinC of the Combined
    Fleet [Yamamoto] can no longer be held responsible for the security
    of the Empire. In that case he will have no alternative but to
    resign, and with him his entire staff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Believe me, this kind of message gets attention
    at the highest levels. It was precisely such a ploy that I became
    involved in at this time. I was in Code 518 under Capt. Gaasterland.
    His immediate boss was Code 510, Adm. Pete Haas, and his immediate
    boss was Code 500, VAdm. Jimmy James &ndash; the senior BuShips
    liaison with the Type Commander Admirals Afloat and the bureau&rsquo;s
    Type Desks. It seems one Type Commander got hold of Adm. James and
    persuaded him that a few of his preferred ShipAlts should be jumped
    up the priority list, and Adm. James passed the word to me to do so.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, I didn&rsquo;t go to Capt. Gaasterland, or
    even to Adm. Haas. I stomped right down to Adm. James&rsquo;s
    office. I&rsquo;d never even met the man before and had to introduce
    myself. Not only that, I barged into a staff conference &ndash; a
    room full of gold braid. I was paranoid mad &ndash; furious. I
    bellowed how I&rsquo;d been hired to do an impossible job, and that
    by God I&rsquo;d been doing it, working around the clock and right
    through weekends, and that I had been promised complete support &ndash;
    no more squeaky wheel getting the grease &ndash; and here he was
    pulling the rug on me. I averred this turn-around would be the hole
    in the dike that would bring the whole ocean crashing through, and
    that if that was all the support I was going to get, then, by God,
    &ldquo;You have my resignation, now!&rdquo; I then stomped out of
    the room.</p>
  <p class="western">Have you got the picture? I have a house full of
    kids, and I&rsquo;m telling them they can take my job and shove it.
    It <i>was</i> heart-felt. After all, I firmly believed that to allow
    the proposed change to pass unchallenged would cause my entire
    position to unravel, and that my job would then indeed become
    impossible. So, in effect, I wouldn&rsquo;t be giving up anything &ndash;
    the job would be finished. I never gave a thought, however, to what
    I would use for money to pay the bills. In any event, I slumped back
    to my office, feeling completely drained, totally betrayed. I felt I
    was already unemployed. I was in shock.</p>
  <p class="western">Within 20 minutes, Adm. Pete Haas sent for me. He
    gave me the old Dutch Uncle treatment: &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t
    get so upset.&rdquo; He then told me that, as I&rsquo;d left Adm.
    James&rsquo;s office, Adm. James had admitted (of me), &ldquo;By
    God, he&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; Adm. James then reversed himself. Adm.
    Haas then pleaded with me to stay on (confirming my feeling that,
    indeed, I <i>had</i> really separated myself from a job). I couldn&rsquo;t
    believe it. I hadn&rsquo;t, I guess, really expected to win. I sort
    of hedged &ndash; what guarantee, after all, would I have that the
    same thing wouldn&rsquo;t happen again next week? &ndash; and so on.
    Well, Adm. Has told me to get back to work, not to worry about it.
    &ldquo;everyone topside,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thought I was doing
    a terrific job &ndash; and <i>I&rsquo;d be getting that in writing.</i></p>
  <p class="western">Good grief! Now, instead of being out of a job,
    apparently I was going to get a commendation. And, indeed, I did,
    thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Per reapportionment schedule approved by
    Bureau of the Budget 6 Mar 1956, and Budget Activity Allocation
    approved by the Navy Comptroller &hellip; the Active Fleet
    Alterations sub-project has been increased 13.7 million dollars as a
    result of our recent request. Except for the relatively &ldquo;free
    money&rdquo; wartime eras, BuShips has <i>never</i> faired so well
    in a Bureau of the Budget reapportionment&hellip; It is considered
    that the aforementioned success is largely attributable to the &hellip;
    recent emphasis on continuous and realistic refinement of &hellip;
    alteration priorities, and the more timely, complete and accurate
    delineation of program details&hellip; Your <i>able</i> leadership
    and <i>assiduous application</i> to the chairmanship of the <i>Fleet
      Improvement Council</i> are recognized as major contributing factors
    to the success of the alterations program&hellip; <i>WELL DONE!</i>
    [Sometimes it pays to get mad, but you&rsquo;d better damn well be
    <i>right</i>!]</p>
  <p class="western">Nevertheless, the pressures of the job continued
    to grow. I was scarcely ever home. In addition to budget hassles,
    there were the continuing fusillades from provincially minded Type
    Commanders at sea. They didn&rsquo;t like a bunch of goddamn
    civilians telling them, in effect, what improvements they were going
    to get in their ships. Never mind that their shore-side
    representatives in the Bureau&rsquo;s Type desks were regularly
    funneling in their input. Finally, there were quarterly
    merry-go-rounds when the pricing-out of the entire program had to be
    updated as new alterations were continuously merged into the program
    listings, ship by ship. These sessions always meant several
    consecutive all-night work-throughs. I was getting more harried and
    beat by the moment. I had already proved I could do the job, but I
    was beginning to wonder if anybody could long keep it up. And I was
    beginning to wonder if it was worth it.</p>
  <p class="western">I guess you had to be there to really comprehend
    the immense, unrelenting pressure of the job. Everyone on the fringe
    of the job gave it lip-service praise, but they couldn&rsquo;t
    really know its toll on my nerves. It&rsquo;s somewhat like Sir
    Thomas Browne said in a similar situation: &ldquo;Pureblind men have
    discoursed well of <i>sight</i>, and those without issue,
    excellently of <i>generation</i>.&rdquo; Kathleen, of course, was
    largely left to shift for our seven children during all of this
    pretty much by herself. So, there were growing strains on the home
    front, as well as the office pressure cooker. This wasn&rsquo;t the
    nice, relaxed, and comfortable family situation I had anticipated.
    Doing well on the job wasn&rsquo;t all that satisfying, either.
    Clearly, something had to be done, and yet the next move was the
    result of an almost casual accident.</p>
  <p class="western">I ran into my friend Jack Smith one day at the
    snack bar coffee break. Jack had been the original representative of
    the electronic division of BuShips on my Fleet Improvement Council,
    but had since transferred to the Data Processing Systems Division of
    the Navy Management Office. We exchanged a few pleasantries, briefly
    discussed our jobs, and then I suddenly inquired whether there might
    be any openings for me in the Navy Management Office. This was
    strictly spur of the moment on my part, because I hadn&rsquo;t
    consciously even started to think of a job change until this point.</p>
  <p class="western">On Easter Monday, 21 Apr 1957, even as ground was
    being broken to build St. Bernadette&rsquo;s Church, I transferred
    to the Navy Management Office as a <i>Program Analyst</i>, GS-14, at
    $10,320 per year. This was another step up the grade structure
    ladder, and provided virtually unlimited opportunity for
    advancement. Even more significantly, this move marked a transition
    in my career pattern from the <i>engineering</i> realm to the
    <i>management</i> realm.</p>
  <p class="western">While in the Machinery Design Branch, I had
    authored an illustrated article anent the challenges and
    opportunities of government engineers, which I then almost sold to
    the then very popular <i>Look</i> magazine, the major competitor of
    <i>Life</i> magazine. (To enhance the potential income, I had even
    signed each colored illustration with a different name, &ldquo;Mort
    Baker.&rdquo;) The uncommon personalized rejection letter regretted
    that only the publication of a related-type article some weeks
    earlier militated against acceptance of my &ldquo;very fine
    article.&rdquo; So it goes.</p>
  <p class="western">The reason I mention this is because one of my
    illustrations (based upon my experience during our post-graduate
    field trip to the General Electric headquarters) depicted the
    baggy-suited head research engineer arriving at the office in a
    Model T, while the sporty V.P. in charge of Sales, complete with
    golf bag slung over the shoulder, arrived in a block-long Cadillac.
    The point is clear: Money is to be found on the <i>management</i>
    side rather than the <i>technical</i> side of business &ndash; or
    government! (The 1984 Engineering Manpower Commission&rsquo;s annual
    salary survey showed that &ldquo;engineering superiors&rdquo;
    (<i>management</i>) earn 10-to-15% more than <i>engineers</i> with
    the same number of years&rsquo; experience but without supervisory
    responsibility.) This particular move, then, was the key one in my
    march to professional success.</p>
  <p class="western">At the same time, this move marked my assumption
    of a converging course for an inevitable eventual collision with the
    <i>Peter Principle</i>. This so-called principle is to the effect
    that any truly persevering professional will eventually progress to
    a level beyond his competence &ndash; and so it was to be,
    eventually, with me. After all, I was now really leaving my true
    trade behind.</p>
  <p class="western">I have already obliquely alluded to the natural
    basis for this job switch. It was the data base complexity of my
    Fleet Maintenance position. This virtually compelled any thinking
    person to investigate the possibility of harnessing computers to
    take the drudgery out of the constant and massive data
    manipulations. For example, new alterations were constantly being
    inserted into an overall, comprehensive priority list. Yet certain
    alterations were only accomplished on certain ships, and there was
    always a fixed funding limit. Hence, there was a constantly
    recurring need to price out the entire program, ship by ship,
    alteration by alteration, to revalidate the constantly changing
    (shrinking) cut-off point. This was a terribly tedious and
    time-consuming job, and all of it was then being done manually.</p>
  <p class="western">So it was that I was led into, first, the
    punch-card-equipment field, and almost immediately thereafter, into
    the just emerging computer field. After all, there were also needs
    to coordinate and collate shipyard schedules, dry-dock schedules,
    material delivery schedules, installation blueprint delivery
    schedules, etc. There were also complex, recurring calls for bushels
    of budget back-up data. If ever there was a fruitful field of
    endeavor for exploitation by computers, this was it. It was only
    natural, therefore, that I gravitated to NMO as the Data Processing
    Systems Division Program Analyst in charge of monitoring the
    development of computer systems for naval shipyard overhaul
    management information systems.</p>
  <p class="western">You might well ask, &ldquo;What did you really
    know about computers?&rdquo; My answer has always been somewhat
    evasive. I continue to contend that you don&rsquo;t really have to
    <i>know</i> very much <i>per se</i> about computers. You don&rsquo;t,
    for example, have to know how a pencil is manufactured in order to
    write with one. Neither do you have to know anything about the guts
    of a computer in order to make it &ldquo;write&rdquo; for you.
    Computers, after all, are no more or less than another tool in
    management&rsquo;s arsenal &ndash; though a very powerful tool, to
    be sure. Rousseau had an observation that seems apt: &ldquo;I shall
    be asked if I am a prince or a legislator to write on politics. I
    answer that I&rsquo;m neither, and that is why I do so. If I <i>were</i>
    a prince or legislator, I should not waste my time in saying what
    wants doing; I should do it and hold my peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Let the computer specialists therefore develop
    better computers. As for me, along with other would-be managers,
    simply set us down at the keyboard and turn us loose. We&rsquo;re
    the guys with problems. Only <i>we</i> know the priorities involved
    and the criteria governing our decisions. No computer can divine any
    of this. It&rsquo;s like the old Army Signal Corps motto: &ldquo;It
    takes an Act of Congress to make Generals; but only the Signal Corps
    can make them Commanding Officers.&rdquo; Computers are nothing more
    than the manager&rsquo;s Signal Corps. They enable enhanced
    management decisions embracing all relevant data on a truly timely
    basis. Computers make would-be managers <i>managers in fact.</i> As
    for me, my decision was: it was time to join the management team!
    So, this ends a short chapter in this book. It was also a short (two
    years, two months) chapter in my life.</p>

      XV. MANAGEMENT</h2>
  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western">People need to be reminded more
    often than they need to be instructed. <span style="font-style: normal">&ndash;&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;Johnson</span></p>
  <p class="western">My transition from a quasi-engineering to a
    quasi-management billet was a significant one, with many unforeseen
    ramifications. I use the qualifier &ldquo;quasi,&rdquo; since while
    my FIC function required an engineering background, it was heavily
    slanted toward the administrative field. Similarly, though my job in
    NMO was management oriented, I had no &ldquo;line&rdquo;
    responsibility but in fact operated in a staff relationship to real
    management. (Since we actually managed nothing, but presumed to tell
    managers how to manage, and since I was one of the very few in my
    new office that had in fact exercised line management responsibility
    in a real-time situation, I often felt compelled privately to remind
    my coworkers that we were in fact parasites.) In all events, while I
    didn&rsquo;t know it then, I was entering upon the longest stint of
    continuous duty in one office that I was to enjoy throughout my
    entire professional career. I would be with the Navy Management
    Office for slightly more than eight-and-a-half years &ndash; until
    its disestablishment. This would be, in many ways, my most fruitful
    or personally rewarding tour, and the one in which (it was to turn
    out) I&rsquo;d peak as a professional.</p>
  <p class="western">To begin with, I was brought aboard as a Program
    Manager in charge of monitoring and guiding the harnessing of
    computers in the service of enhanced shipyard management. Yet, in
    almost no time at all, I was elevated to the job of Assistant
    Division Director. This little move leap-frogged me over a
    half-dozen more senior professionals. As it was with my chairmanship
    of the FIC (and even earlier as the young Chief Engineer at sea in
    charge of salty, old-hand, up-from-the-ranks, father-figure,
    &ldquo;mustang&rdquo; commissioned and warrant officers), it was a
    case of &ldquo;a little child shall lead them.&rdquo; It seems that
    I spent most of my life bossing around older, more experienced
    people. I must have had some sort of knack for this. This knack, I&rsquo;m
    sure, consisted of getting on top of any incipient rebellion at the
    very outset &ndash; letting everyone know who was in charge.</p>
  <p class="western">Early on in NMO I provided an almost instant
    replay of the Cdr. Kittendorf put-down at my first FIC meeting. One
    loud-mouthed and self-proclaimed know-it-all section head in my
    division, who had only days before my appointment as Assistant
    Division Director ranked as my senior, had the temerity publicly to
    volunteer &ldquo;<i>straightening</i> me out&rdquo; &ndash; feigning
    to save me from an assumed ignorance on some point. Well, I
    thereupon unleashed on him a violent diatribe about possibly &ldquo;<i>laying</i>
    him out&rdquo; if he didn&rsquo;t quickly realize there had been
    some changes made, and by God starting immediately he had better
    realize that he should no longer presume to tell me what to do, I&rsquo;d
    tell <i>him</i>! I asked if he had any questions on that score. I&rsquo;ll
    never forget his meek, cowering, obsequious confession of undying
    fealty forevermore. I had no more problems.</p>
  <p class="western">I&rsquo;d been aboard scarcely a month when we
    added another child to the family, Monica being born on 28 May 1957.
    Apparently she enjoyed a very pleasant childhood, because more than
    25 years later, she still reveled in many fond memories. She
    remembered how the kids could completely remodel the playroom when
    they played &ldquo;dress-up,&rdquo; moving anything and everything
    around to make little rooms and houses. She remembers how viruses
    were passed down the line just like old clothes, and that too often
    they were countered by what she came to call &ldquo;Pepto-Dismal,&rdquo;
    which usually prompted an immediate bathroom line-up to throw up.
    She remembers how she really enjoyed listening to Kathleen&rsquo;s
    &ldquo;pretty music,&rdquo; and how frequently they&rsquo;d invent
    ballet dances to go with it, and even sell tickets for their
    performances.</p>
  <p class="western">Other times, they&rsquo;d be content to listen to
    Kathleen's &ldquo;opera singing,&rdquo; which often accompanied the
    music. She remembers a great blizzard (1964?), when it was an
    adventure to walk behind me single-file to the street where she
    could &ldquo;finally see again,&rdquo; the unplowed snow being
    higher than her head. Then we all walked straight down the middle of
    University Blvd., because there were no cars on the road. She also
    recalls a special payment system for good report cards, and she
    always liked getting her report card because it meant more money.
    she has an obviously somewhat distorted recollection of me &ldquo;getting
    up tight&rdquo; when about to leave for &ldquo;great&rdquo;
    vacations, and how Kathleen always lightened the trips by passing
    around fresh fruit and cookies en route.</p>
  <p class="western">Another treat she remembers about vacations was
    that all the kids got special spending money in the morning and some
    more for dinner in the evening. Perhaps this segment would be
    entitled &ldquo;I remember Melvin&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Then of course
    there was the tragedy of the loss of those cute little red-rimmed
    eyeglasses when she got flattened by a big wave. Even repeated trips
    to the Coast Guard Station&rsquo;s lost and found boxes failed to
    recover them. And who will ever forget watching the kids&rsquo;
    jerking-the-wallet-on-a-string game?</p>
  <p class="western">Hey! There <i>will</i> be a quiz! All of this
    nostalgia isn&rsquo;t spliced in here for nothing. This is a test of
    reader fortitude. I want to discover how many people really
    persisted through all my job recital to this point. Pretty sneaky,
    huh? Well, if you&rsquo;ve come this far, it&rsquo;s only fair that
    I offer still a little more of Monica&rsquo;s remembrances.</p>
  <p class="western">She recalls how, after going to Ocean City for
    several summers, she began feeling like a native, since the children
    always enjoyed great freedom to explore along the boardwalk. She
    recalls striking up a conversation with a young employee in one of
    the arcades who was complaining about the tourists and asked if she
    were one. &ldquo;Oh, no! I&rsquo;ve been here a week!&rdquo; Well,
    by then O.C. really was her &ldquo;home away from home.&rdquo;
    Actually her enjoyment of vacations was second only to her enjoyment
    of Christmas. She recalls how breakfast seemed to take forever &ndash;
    but it did make the excitement grow and last, as did opening
    presents one by one, until almost on cue everyone started opening
    them together. The she remembered visits to Grandma Kirk, whose
    summertime specialty seemed to be <i>Fizzies</i> &ndash; flavored
    drink that bubbled like Alka-Seltzer.</p>
  <p class="western">Then there was the time Monica held a slumber
    party, and all the kids went outside to play. The only thing
    Kathleen demanded was that they stay in the immediate vicinity of
    the house. Yielding to peer pressure, Monica trooped them off to
    visit the &ldquo;haunted house&rdquo; (then located where the
    Safeway now stands). When Kathleen couldn&rsquo;t spot them nearby,
    she got in the car and went looking for them. She soon found them,
    thanks to some &ldquo;chickens&rdquo; who stood outside rather than
    venture into the haunted house. Then followed Kathleen&rsquo;s
    patented &ndash; worse than death &ndash; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s sit
    down and talk&rdquo; routine. All Moni&rsquo;s friends first got
    sent down to the playroom. Moni reports, &ldquo;The talks she gave
    were a million times worse than a spanking, withdrawal of my
    allowance or even restrictions could ever have been. she&rsquo;d
    tell me how worried she&rsquo;d been, that she had trusted me and
    how I&rsquo;d let her down. It was <i>terrible</i>. I remember
    thinking &ndash; please stop! Just beat me or something! I felt so
    bad!&rdquo; (Well, I must say, it&rsquo;s always nice to learn that
    I wasn&rsquo;t the only &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; in the house after all.)</p>
  <p class="western">In October of 1957, my Mom moved again, with
    Margaret and Jimmy of course. This time they hopped from Bieber
    Place to 97000 Colesville Road. On 4 Oct 1957 the Russians sent a
    chill down the spine of all Americans with the successful launching
    of Sputnik. This was just about the time, too, that Ford was losing
    400 million dollars on the failed Edsel. As we swung into 1958,
    America finally got into space with Explorer I, Nautilus traversed
    beneath the North Pole, Alaska was granted statehood, and everybody
    was singing about some bozo named <i>Tom Dooley</i>. By May everyone
    was freaking out in a Hula Hoop. By 4 Aug 1958 the British Overseas
    Airways had initiated the first transatlantic jet service even as
    the U.S. wasn&rsquo;t to inaugurate any jet service until late
    December with a more modest New York to Miami venture. In the
    interim Pope Pius XII died 9 Oct 1958. (I encountered Uncle Jimmy on
    the steps of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Church the next day quoting odds on
    the identity of the next Pope.)</p>
  <p class="western">Good Pope John XXIII was elected on 28 Oct 1958.
    On 14 Dec St. Bernadette&rsquo;s new church was finally dedicated,
    even as I was elevated to GS-15 and the munificent salary of $12,770
    as a program analyst. For the uninitiated, GS-15 is the top of the
    merit civil service system. All supergrades are by executive
    (political) appointment, and carry the insecurity that goes with
    political office in general. I was therefore now at the end of my
    professional line so far as grade structure is concerned. Of course,
    each grade had ten steps, so I still had some room for salary
    growth, and indeed I was a GS-15 Step 10 long before I retired. In
    fact my performance was sufficiently &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo; to
    achieve transition from step one to step ten (which normally
    stipulated a minimum cumulative time in grade of 18 years) in less
    than 13-1/2 years!</p>
  <p class="western">Of course any thought of retirement in the late
    1950s was the furthest thing from my mind. My professional star was
    still rising. In many ways, NMO was the ideal office for me. There
    was nothing else like it in the Navy Department. To fully appreciate
    the import of the last statement, you must first be subjected to at
    least a capsule crash course in the organizational structure of the
    Department of the Navy.</p>
  <p class="western">The first thing you must understand is that the
    term &ldquo;Department of the Navy&rdquo; embraced the whole
    shebang: civilians as well as &ldquo;blue and gold&rdquo; military,
    ashore as well as afloat, the whole worldwide shooting match. The
    term &ldquo;Navy Department,&rdquo; on the other hand, comprised the
    composite civilian-military Navy complex <i>headquartered</i> in
    Washington, DC. The Navy Department actually comprised a huge
    military entourage under the leadership of the Chief of Naval
    Operations and largely quartered in the Pentagon, and a <i>composite</i>
    civilian-military entourage (scattered throughout town, including in
    the old Main Navy building formerly on Constitution Avenue between
    the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial) for which the
    lines of authority trended upward to peak in the office of SecNav
    himself.</p>
  <p class="western">In general the various offices in the composite
    ranch of the Navy Department were each headed by more-or-less
    &ldquo;equal&rdquo; civilian and military representatives ultimately
    responsible to SecNav and the CNO, respectively. NMO was unique in
    this respect. It was the <i>only</i> purely civilian staff directly
    accountable to the Administrative Assistant to SecNav, who in turn
    was directly subordinate only to SecNav. In other words, NMO was as
    near to the top of the Navy hierarchy as you could get, and was
    <i>virtually free from any and all military domination or influence</i>.</p>
  <p class="western">As you might imagine, to me this set-up
    represented heaven on earth, and like everything on earth it was not
    to last. (I left NMO, in fact, only when and because it was
    officially disestablished on 19 Dec 1965 under pressure on SecNav by
    the CNO!) Meanwhile, life near the top was great, and we were <i>very</i>
    near the top. In fact, our official designation was NMO-EXOS-Navy
    Dept-Wash. D.C. &ndash; that is, Navy Management Office, Executive
    office of the Secretary (of the Navy), headquartered in Washington,
    DC. And I was Assistant Director of one of its two major divisions,
    and top-of-grade. Literally, I had nowhere to go but down &ndash;
    but that journey of descent was still quite a way off.</p>
  <p class="western">The two major divisions of NMO were my Data
    Processing Systems Division and the Management Analysis Division.
    The latter was charged with improving management procedures
    throughout the department, whereas we were charged with harnessing
    these management tasks to computers, which were (in 1957 through
    1965) just coming into the picture. NMO had three other smaller
    sections which should be mentioned: an Organizational Planning
    Section, an Industrial Engineering Section, and a Management
    Sciences Section. Whereas the Management Analysis Division was
    essentially concerned with office <i>management</i> procedures, the
    Organizational Planning Section was concerned with office
    <i>organization</i>, and the Industrial Engineering Section was
    concerned with <i>industrial procedures</i> (as in ordnance plants
    and shipyards, etc.). The Management Sciences Section comprised
    three long-hair mathematicians whose responsibility it was to assure
    the optimum exploitation of the capabilities of the computers, the
    introduction of which was facilitated by our division.</p>
  <p class="western">These were rather large responsibilities, and our
    organizational placement assured that we had correspondingly large
    authority by means of which we might acquit them. This also meant I
    was now in the &ldquo;big leagues&rdquo; &ndash; the majors &ndash;
    and all the personnel in NMO were top-of-the-line types, first-class
    professionals. I&rsquo;m rather proud to say that I belonged. I
    always held my own, and then some. In fact, looking back only now, I
    realize I might well have come across to some (most?) of my peers as
    somewhat pushy. I can only say that you have to be &ldquo;pushy&rdquo;
    to some extent to succeed at this level., just as a successful
    entertainer generally must be an egotistical extrovert. Also, any
    apparent or potential pushiness was, I believe, somewhat ameliorated
    in my favor by an overriding sense of humor and a demonstrated
    record of generally being right. It never hurts to be right.</p>
  <p class="western">It was in the foregoing context or perspective
    that I operated from 1957 to 1965 &ndash; with virtually the
    authority, force, and effectiveness of SecNav. Orders, policies, and
    regulations which I authored in this period, <i>for SecNav
      signature</i>, effectively directed the entire &ldquo;blue and gold&rdquo;
    Navy what to do &ndash; from the lowest Seaman, 2/c, to the CNO. And
    I authored a lot of other official stuff, like testimony to be
    presented before the office of the Bureau of the Budget (the
    forerunner of David Stockman&rsquo;s OMB enterprise), the General
    Accounting Office, and various Congressional Committees. It amused
    me that this <i>civilian</i> also authored occasional pieces under
    the title <i>The Captain&rsquo;s Corner</i> in our monthly Navy-wide
    management review. I also authored input to official speeches by
    SecDef, SecNav, CNO, and, of course, the Chief of NMO. (The latter
    recalls once sitting at a sidewalk caf&eacute; at the very foot of
    the Himalayas, somewhere in India or Pakistan in the late 1970s, and
    discussing an impending speech he was to make with some native
    official, when the latter suggested that he &ldquo;incorporate some
    of those humorous points you made in that speech Jack Wright wrote
    for you&rdquo; in nineteen-fifty-something. You see! My fame is
    virtually worldwide.)</p>
  <p class="western">I personally remember cracking up JFK&rsquo;s
    SecNav, his old war buddy Paul &ldquo;Red&rdquo; Fay, at the Chief
    of NMO&rsquo;s retirement party. I always emceed these affairs, and
    for this one I had typed up a bunch of actual Western Union telegram
    forms and was passing them off as the reactions of various
    celebrities to our Boss&rsquo;s retirement. Now, you have to
    understand that this &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; was virtually a
    firing, since our office was being disestablished, and the boss
    hadn&rsquo;t (like me, and most others) been reassigned. It also
    happened that one of the farewell gifts was a full set of golf
    <i>clubs</i>. So, one of my telegrams was represented as being from
    Arnold Palmer (then pre-eminent golfer in the world). It read
    somewhat as follows:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Dear Ed &ndash; Sorry to hear you&rsquo;ll
    be out of a job &ndash; However, this freedom should enable you to
    better enjoy the <i>clubs</i> I&rsquo;m sending you &ndash; I
    understand somebody else already got your <i>Balls</i> &ndash;
    signed/Arnold Palmer. [As I said, &ldquo;Red&rdquo; Fay damn near
    fell down laughing.]</p>

    Navy Management Review &ndash; March 1964<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote58anc" href="#sdendnote58sym"><sup>58</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">On the serious side, my original computer
    directives came to be regarded as masterpieces. In fact, they were
    virtually copied (so far as applicable and without attribution, of
    course) when &ldquo;mirror&rdquo; offices (reflecting our function
    at their level) were set up first in DOD, and later in the Bureau of
    the Budget. Perhaps the first major directive of this sort was the
    famous <i>Graybook</i>. This, the <i>original</i> Navy Automatic
    Data Processing/Management Information Systems <i>bible</i>, went
    through eight printings, and was endorsed by government and industry
    alike as &ldquo;ahead of its time.&rdquo; It was a 66-page SecNav
    Instruction first issued on 16 Apr 1959. It was 100% edited and 30%
    originated by me. The first real update of the <i>Graybook</i> was
    the <i>Greenbook</i>, issued 26 Feb 1964. It was 75% originated and
    100% edited by me. This time I also had 100% responsibility for the
    directive, and so I was able to cull the instructions down from 66
    to 30 pages while preserving all the meat. (As readers well know,
    I&rsquo;ve never been prone to prolixity.)</p>
  <p class="western">My final effort in the preparation of
    comprehensive computer program&ndash;oriented SecNav directives was
    the <i>Bluebook</i>, which was 100% edited by me but issued in the
    late 1960s from the Automatic Data Processing Selection Office some
    time after the demise of NMO. To the extent that these directives
    governed the acquisition and use of computers throughout the entire
    Department of the Navy, I certainly had a major role in guiding the
    introduction of automatic data processing to Navy management
    generally. I&rsquo;m sort of proud of my part in all this.</p>
  <p class="western">Moving right along, we now swing into 1959. This
    was the era of quiz show furors &ndash; like when Charles Van Doren
    became a non-celebrity overnight when it was discovered that he
    cheated on the TV show <i>Twenty-One</i>. This was also the year
    that Castro took over Cuba (1 Jan 1959). Pope John XXIII announced
    his plans for Vatican II (29 Jan 1959 &ndash; it would run from 11
    Oct 1962 to 8 Dec 1965, and the Church would never again be the
    same), Hawaii became a state, and Father Stricker became a
    Monsignor. On 10 Apr the world was finally introduced to our famous
    first seven astronauts. Can you name them? (CCGGSSS &ndash;
    Carpenter, Cooper, Glenn, Grissom, Shepard, Schirra, Slayton). My
    mother was on the move, too, once again, this time following along
    with the Andrews from their home on Colesville Road to the one on
    the corner of Lanark Way. All of this pales, of course, with the big
    news of the year: Mo put in an appearance on 3 Aug 1959. And
    &ldquo;putting in an appearance&rdquo; was about all she did. She
    checked in at about 3-1/2 pounds, and was to languish in an
    air-conditioned crib at Columbia Hospital long after Kathleen had
    returned home. Her arrival marked what turned out to be our entire
    <i>living</i> brood, spanning up to George, then age 14.</p>
  <p class="western">Naturally such a miraculous event had to be
    properly celebrated. This was easily accomplished. Gene Sheehan&rsquo;s
    wife gave birth at Columbia Hospital also, either the day before or
    the day after Kathleen &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know why I can&rsquo;t
    remember &ndash; so Gene and I spent a lot of hors together at the
    bar across the street, Melona&rsquo;s. As everyone knows, Gene
    (Maureen&rsquo;s godfather) is my greatest living friend, even
    though he is Irish to the core! Pat Conroy&rsquo;s phrase sums him
    up best: &ldquo;Each Irishman is a nation unto himself&hellip; They
    are incapable of self-rule or of accepting the hegemony of their
    superiors.&rdquo; Of course Gene would insist he has no superiors.
    Nevertheless, I was charged with being his in a shared professional
    world, so our enduring close friendship is introduced as evidence
    that I could at least get along with somebody &ndash; and an
    Irishman at that. (Of course, this all evolved before I learned that
    I too was Irish &ndash; <i>KELLY!</i> &ndash; in the course of
    researching and writing this epic.)</p>
  <p class="western">One of my recollections attending Mo&rsquo;s
    birth was how Anne, then age 12, took over the running of the house.
    She prepared meals and cleaned up (with help, of course) after
    meals, did laundry, and generally babysat her younger siblings, and
    she did it all with apparent ease. This was all remarkably
    demonstrated by a parallel event of that period. As a gesture of
    friendship and to &ldquo;help out,&rdquo; two much more mature
    maiden ladies from my office generously had us all over one evening
    for a community pool swim followed by a picnic dinner on the lawn of
    the home of one of the ladies. Well, we all had a gala frolic in the
    pool and the adjourned to the lady&rsquo;s yard. There we enjoyed
    hot dogs, chips, potato salad, Cokes, etc. &ndash; normal and
    filling picnic fare. Yet it was eye-opening to me to behold the
    relative anxiety which inundated these two dear friends as they
    strove frantically to minister to our hyper-active brood. I&rsquo;m
    sure when we left that they both collapsed into chairs right where
    they were and slept the night through. The contrast was highlighted
    by Steady Eddie Anne&rsquo;s unflappability in assuming Kathleen&rsquo;s
    place during the latter&rsquo;s hospital internment. (I apologize,
    Anne, for delaying so long in now publicly rendering this &ndash;
    <i>Well Done!</i>)</p>
  <p class="western">The foregoing story reminds me, in turn, of
    another experience involving my office associates which occurred
    about this time. I&rsquo;ve already alluded to the long-hair
    mathematicians in our small Management Sciences Division. The head
    of that group was a Jewish genius, Dr. Jacob Emmanuel Isaac Heller,
    an Austrian refugee from Hitler&rsquo;s Germany. He wrote a book
    about his piggy-backing his young crippled daughter and leading his
    frail wife by the hand to freedom through the Swiss Alps at night,
    <i>Our Share of Morning</i> (which is, I believe, a phrase from an
    Emily Dickinson poem). Jay, as we called him, was a real genius, but
    unlike most geniuses he had a beautiful sense of humor. He had a
    favorite joke about mathematicians which he liked to tell on
    himself, by way of demonstrating their tunnel-vision preoccupation
    with pure numbers.</p>
  <p class="western">It seems he was traveling by train one in Europe
    with a companion who did not have a ticket. His companion said &ldquo;not
    to worry,&rdquo; and just asked Jay to show him his ticket, which he
    did. At the station, he then followed Jay through the turnstile.
    When the conductor grabbed him and asked to see his ticket, he
    merely protested, &ldquo;I just gave it to you.&rdquo; To prove his
    point, he proceeded to recite the number of the ticket. The confused
    conductor thereupon let him pass. Jay confessed that soon thereafter
    he himself was caught without a ticket and immediately proceeded to
    effect the same gambit, glibly reciting the well-memorized <i>same</i>
    number! (No, it didn&rsquo;t work.)</p>
  <p class="western">This is sort of reminiscent of <i>painter</i>
    George Roult. Reportedly, he loved his wife very, very much, but as
    he observed her face as she lay dying he was heard to exclaim, &ldquo;God!
    What a beautiful purple!&rdquo; By the way, and as befitted his
    mathematical genius, Jay was also the fellow who, at the height of
    plane sabotaging and hijackings in the 1960s came up with the
    perfect solution. He averred that if he had to travel by air during
    that period he&rsquo;d simply carry his own bomb aboard, remarking
    that &ldquo;the odds of <i>two</i> bombs being on the <i>same</i>
    plane would be astronomical!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">In the immortal words of Roseanne Rosannadanna,
    &ldquo;It just goes to show you!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s all too easy for
    all of us to sometimes become so preoccupied with our &ldquo;specialty&rdquo;
    (a euphemism for &ldquo;work&rdquo;) that we lose sight of the point
    &ndash; <i>why</i> it is that we&rsquo;re working. I&rsquo;m sure
    that happened to me. I recognize &ndash; <i>NOW</i> &ndash; that I
    must have been almost totally work oriented in the first half of the
    1960s. Oh, sure! I still took time out for brief inflictions of &ldquo;Now
    we&rsquo;re gong to have a good time, or else!&rdquo; threats, but
    then it was right back to total submergence in office work. My
    family forays were little more than coming up for air. I really am
    afraid that I lost touch with my children at this vitally important
    and exciting stage in their lives. I have no way of estimating what
    that cost them &ndash; or me &ndash; but the time just seemed to fly
    by.</p>
  <p class="western">On Washington&rsquo;s Birthday, my mother moved
    again, this time to <i>our</i> house on Kinross Avenue! (In an
    interesting coincidence, she had left Dallas Avenue on Washington&rsquo;s
    Birthday precisely ten years before! That decade, the 1950s, was the
    period of my sister&rsquo;s purgatory with mother.) In May of 1960
    Gary Powers and the U-2 were shot down. In June I joined the Knights
    of Columbus and thereupon initiated a series of Fourth of July
    family picnics with friends (and mosquitoes) at the K of C Hall and
    grounds near the Bethesda Naval Hospital. Soon we were ready for
    1961.</p>
  <p class="western">JFK ushered in 1961 on the snow-frozen morning of
    20 Jan. He also ushered in a new era &ndash; that &ldquo;brief
    shining moment &ldquo;(which, sadly, has tarnished a little with
    age). This was also the time of Chubby Checkers and the twist, Pete
    Seeger and <i>This Land Is My Land</i>, the end of coast-to-coast
    separate facilities for &ldquo;negroes,&rdquo; and everyone went
    into &ldquo;shake, rattle, and roll.&rdquo; We were (at last) rid of
    our much-loved but failing DeSoto. On 15 Feb we hopped into our
    dazzling white Corvair station wagon (after carefully checking
    headroom for kids sitting in the back). This was the first <i>new</i>
    car we had ever bought, and I think it still remains my
    all-time-favorite car. This was also the time of &ldquo;Good night,
    Chet; good night, David,&rdquo; and Michael was forever rowing his
    boat ashore. And, oh yes, Uncle Jimmy was in some real financial
    distress. There are only two points I wish to make about this
    unhappy development. The first is that it has been my experience
    that distress can often be a blessing to the extent that it brings
    people closer together. I have now been a personal witness to this
    many times. Trouble does tend to engender &ndash; or rather,
    activate &ndash; the too-often latent nobility that lurks within
    family, friends, and neighbors. That&rsquo;s good!</p>
  <p class="western">I don&rsquo;t wish to labor the second point, but
    it has (sadly!) also been my universal experience that so-called
    <i>Catholic</i> charities simply aren&rsquo;t very charitable.
    Conversely, it has been my universal experience that the one, old
    reliable, truly substantive charitable organization in the world is
    the Salvation Army. I was delighted to discover in William
    Manchester&rsquo;s superb personal war memoir, <i>Goodbye Darkness</i>,
    that he confirms this view. Writing of his WWI-injured father, he
    says:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">He lay there in his blood and corrupt flesh
    for five days, unattended, his death certificate already signed.
    Three civilians passed through the tent, representing the Knights of
    Columbus, the Red Cross, and the Salvation Army. The first,
    distributing cigarettes and candy, saw the Masonic ring on his left
    hand and skipped his cot. The Red Cross man tried to sell him &ndash;
    yes, sell him &ndash; a pack of cigarettes; Manchester had no money,
    so he got nothing&hellip; But millions of Americans had contributed
    to the Red Cross to ease the lot of soldiers, and the conduct of
    some of its agents in hospitals behind the lines was nothing short
    of criminal.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">It was the Salvation Army man who finally
    gave the penniless, suffering lance corporal two packs of Lucky
    Strikes and tried to cheer him up. As long as he lived, Manchester
    reached for coins when he passed the Salvation Army tambourine.
    [Amen!]</p>
  <p class="western">The <i>Salvation Army</i> took my sister and her
    children in when nobody else, including <i>Catholic charities</i>,
    would loan her a dime. (I had a similarly disturbing experience with
    <i>Catholic </i><i>C</i><i>harities</i> during Mary&rsquo;s period
    of distress in the early 1970s.) I, too, have ever since regularly
    contributed every year to the Salvation Army, as I propose to do the
    rest of my life. At the same time, one is reminded of Bishop Sheen&rsquo;s
    explanation of the story of the Good Samaritan, wherein the priest
    passes the victim by. Bishop Sheen explains and humorously excuses
    the priest on the grounds that &ldquo;he first had to go to Catholic
    charities and fill out several forms in triplicate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">April of 1961 was bad news for the U.S. on two
    fronts. On the 12th Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space &ndash;
    a Russian. On the 17th JFK flirted with disaster at the Bay of Pigs.
    Unlike most of our leaders since then, he immediately took full
    <i>personal responsibility</i> for the failure! The U.S. did bounce
    back on the space front on 5 May when Alan Shepard went suborbital,
    but an even bigger blast-off was to come on 9 May 1961. This was the
    day when oral contraceptives were declared to be safe, <i>and no
      virgin has been ever since.</i> But things weren&rsquo;t just going
    badly on the frontier of space or the national front. They were
    suddenly going awry on the home front as well. On 19 May Kathleen
    was rushed to the hospital by ambulance yet once again. This time,
    though, things were infinitely more ominous, since she was only
    seven months pregnant. Well, Herbie arrived &ndash; and departed &ndash;
    on 29 May 1961.</p>
  <p class="western">I don&rsquo;t think the temper of the moment can
    be better conveyed than by inserting Kathleen&rsquo;s letter to my
    mother (and my postscript) dated 26 May 1961, thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Dear Grandma &ndash; Do you remember saying
    many times, &ldquo;What good am I?&rdquo; Do you need a more
    dramatic answer than that pure little soul who is with God; or the
    nine others, big and little, whose mother is coming home to them
    alive and well. Both of those are spectacular. When I think of all
    the countless little things you have done every day in the little
    over a year you have been with us, to help and give comfort and
    happiness, I know I can never thank you adequately. But at least I
    do want to say it and now &ndash; Thank you and God bless you!
    s/Kappy.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">P.S. Mother &ndash; I think Kappy has said
    it <i>all</i>. I can only add emphasis. I&rsquo;m sure all of us can
    thank you for her <i>being alive today</i>. However, whether she had
    died last week &ndash; or at the age of 100 &ndash; I&rsquo;m sure
    you&rsquo;ll agree with me that she will have a choice place on
    heaven. Therefore &ndash; even more so do I feel a debt to you for
    Herbie. He only lived 3 hours &ndash; but what a difference! He was
    born alive &ndash; and he was baptized! I think his glorious place
    in heaven today is especially the result of your presence and your
    rising to a frightful occasion. So &ndash; you&rsquo;ve always been
    a wonderful mother &ndash; and I already owe you so much &ndash; but
    when will your miracles cease? God bless you &ndash; Love! s/Jack.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, I&rsquo;m sure you get the picture. This
    really was a precarious time for Kathleen. We almost lost her, and
    then what a different story this would be! At the same time I can
    almost hear someone shouting, &ldquo;Hey! You just said something
    nice about your own mother!&rdquo; Well &hellip; yes! A sort of
    lifelong metamorphosis has been in progress, you see, and it hasn&rsquo;t
    been adequately reflected in this book &ndash; certainly not in the
    gradual manner in which it actually occurred. Had I the requisite
    skill, I would have traced &ndash; through the recounting of
    demonstrative dramatic examples, rather than mere recital &ndash; a
    progression in my feelings <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> my mother:
    insecurity, humiliation, resentment, disgust, indifference,
    bitterness, fury at her, fury at myself, questioning, doubt,
    suspicion, realization, testing, remorse, false generosity,
    re-evaluation, real generosity, sacrifice, love, commitment, and &ndash;
    finally &ndash; contentment.</p>
  <p class="western">Perhaps at this point I was only up to &ldquo;false
    generosity&rdquo; &ndash; I meant well, but my heart wasn&rsquo;t
    really in it yet. It was sort of a feeling of &ldquo;duty
    performed.&rdquo; The final resolution of the mother vs. son (and
    vice versa) saga is, of course, one of the essential parts of this
    story, and revelation of the ultimate reconciliation at this point
    would be decidedly premature. We&rsquo;ll elaborate the conclusion
    of this process in due course.</p>
  <p class="western">So, life went on &ndash; the Russians startled
    the world with the overnight erection of the Berlin Wall in August
    of 1961, and they topped that off with the 16&ndash;28 Oct Missile
    Crisis &ndash; a fitting end to a really bad year. John Glenn soon
    lifted our spirits on 20 Feb 1962 when he lifted off for three
    successful earth orbits, right on the heels of the 10 Feb Soviet
    freeing of U-2&ndash;incident victim Gary Powers.</p>
  <p class="western">Between these two events I enjoyed the rare
    distinction of being (along with Thomas Aquinas) quoted by no less
    than Edward R. Murrow! That came about this way. The government then
    featured an annual Arthur S. Flemming luncheon and awards ceremony
    to honor the ten most outstanding young <i>men</i> (sic!) in the
    federal government. Edward R. Murrow, then director of the U.S.
    Information Agency, was selected to be guest speaker and make the
    awards presentation.</p>
  <p class="western">As it turned out, I was the one who wrote the
    citation for one of the ten recipients of the awards. Murrow noted
    that the selection board had &ldquo;canvassed 87 Cabinet, Executive,
    and independent agencies, ranging from the Administrative Office of
    the United States Courts to the Washington Botanical Gardens. A
    decision was made to recognize half administrative and half
    technical persons. Sixty-seven nominees resulted. The final
    selection of these 10 recipients was made from a screening process
    narrowing the field to 21 nominees &ndash; 10 administrative, 10
    technical. The 21st finalist was some poor chap described to me as
    an odd leftover &lsquo;technical administrator.&rsquo; I do not
    know, but I hope he won.&rdquo; Jack Smith did, and who do you
    suppose came up with the notion of designating him as a hybrid
    &ldquo;technical administrator&rdquo;? That even got Ed Murrow&rsquo;s
    attention.</p>
  <p class="western">Murrow had an introductory story that also merits
    attention, thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Performance and work, especially when it is
    well done, often goes unnoticed. I well recall an episode involving
    a colleague of mine several months back who found under the
    windshield of his automobile this notice: &ldquo;Merry Christmas and
    Happy New Year, from the boys at the garage.&rdquo; My friend was
    touched. He made a mental note to leave a gift of several dollars
    for the boys at the garage. But his mental note was erased from his
    slate of memory. Several weeks passed, and two days before the
    holiday my friend found another note on his windshield: &ldquo;Merry
    Christmas and Happy New Year, from the boys at the garage. Second
    notice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">It&rsquo;s true! People too often go unremarked
    for their virtues. So let me pause to inject this long overdue paean
    right here:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Let the word go forth from this tome and
    place, we not only love all of our children dearly, we are also
    extremely PROUD of each and every one of them! They have taught us
    much for which we are in their debt. AMEN!</p>
  <p class="western">Case in point: Sunday, 10 Jun 1962 &ndash; George
    was one of the 22 honorees of the Seventeenth Annual Commencement of
    the Priory School. Naturally his W&#8209;R&#8209;I&#8209;G&#8209;H&#8209;T
    placed him at the end of the graduation list, but he was that day at
    the very top of our esteem. I can still recall the thrill of hearing
    him cited as a claimant to a scholarship at Fordham University and
    an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy. I remember, too, how I
    cited him with a solid handshake at the conclusion of the ceremony
    as I exclaimed, &ldquo;May I never be less proud of you than I am
    today!&rdquo; Certainly I haven&rsquo;t been &ndash; so far. Similar
    thoughts and feelings attended similar celebrations of like events
    with all our children.</p>
  <p class="western">Nevertheless, when we allude to our pride in our
    offspring, we&rsquo;re essentially referring to <i>who</i> they are
    &ndash; and to who they are (so long as they live) <i>becoming</i>.
    We&rsquo;re proud of their character! After all, it wasn&rsquo;t
    easy growing up in our house, as Moni can attest. She remembers the
    day Kathleen took her hand (for safety&rsquo;s sake, of course) and
    promptly walked her right into a telephone pole. Hey! There&rsquo;s
    more. Who can forget the day Kathleen injected Moni&rsquo;s nose
    with <i>Clorox</i> nose drops? (It seems George had adapted an empty
    nose-drop bottle for ink-eradicating purposes.) Kathleen remembers
    the reaction of the responder to her call to the Emergency Poison
    Hotline: &ldquo;Hey, Gus, I&rsquo;ve got some clown on the phone
    who&rsquo;s just put <i>Clorox</i> up her kid&rsquo;s nose!&rdquo;
    No, growing up in our clan was never easy, and having to do it in
    the 1960s didn&rsquo;t make it easier.</p>
  <p class="western">Moving into the fall of 1962, Pope John opened
    his long promised Council on 11 Oct. Meanwhile, I was involved in a
    council of my own, serving on special assignment to a so-called
    Materiel Management Study Group under the direction of Adm. R. E. M.
    Ward. The latter, a WWII submarine skipper-hero, was one tough
    cookie. (I usually got along great with these types &ndash;
    providing they were competent, of course, seeing it as just another
    plebe-year challenge.) I still recall his calling me over to his
    house after work one night and working with me right straight
    through to sun-up. At that point he simply barked, &ldquo;Go home,
    take a shower, grab a bite to eat, and I&rsquo;ll see you at the
    office in an hour!&rdquo; (I was there! He wasn&rsquo;t.)</p>
  <p class="western">I was in his office on another occasion when his
    son (a Navy Lt.) phoned to complain and implicitly seek his help
    after the son&rsquo;s request for a slight delay in change of duty
    station to attend a wife on the verge of her first delivery had been
    snarled in red tape. Old Ward simply asked, &ldquo;Have you got your
    orders?&rdquo; The son apparently replied, &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo;
    to which Ward barked, &ldquo;Carry them out!&rdquo; and smashed down
    the phone. This guy even looked like a bulldog, and he sure had a
    snarling manner and temper to match. As I said, my kind of guy.
    Really! I got along with him fine since I was one of the few who
    would stand up to him. I had his respect as he had mine.</p>
  <p class="western">In the foregoing perspective, perhaps you can now
    better appreciate why I&rsquo;m especially proud of the following
    commendation bestowed by Adm. Ward on the completion of this special
    assignment (21 Nov 1962):</p>
  <p class="quote-western">During the past several months, Mr. John H.
    Wright has been on loan to this Materiel Management Study Group&hellip;
    Upon completion of this complex and important study, I should like
    to express &hellip; my sincere appreciation for &hellip; the
    valuable contribution which he has made. Mr. Wright was one of the
    first to join the Group so that he was involved in the formation and
    structure of the Group, the development of a Group study plan, and
    the generation of guidelines for subsequent study efforts. He
    continued throughout the study as a member of my personal planning
    staff, as well as a member of the team which I assigned to study
    ships and support materiel management and a second team studying
    inventory control and supply management. Further, Mr. Wright
    assisted materially in the development of our report, including the
    drafting of our initial problem identification paper and the pulling
    together of certain parts of the final report itself. <i>Mr. Wright
      displays a great deal of initiative, works very well with others in
      a joint team effort, and assumes responsibility readily.</i> [Well,
    you&rsquo;d have to say he was a man of keen insight and knew me
    very well.]</p>
  <p class="western">The year 1962 concluded with 16 inches of snow in
    December. On one occasion I walked home (the buses simply quit
    running) from Main Navy to Kinross, leaving Constitution Avenue
    about 1700, barely making it up steep Meridian Hill, and then
    falling in the door utterly exhausted about 2200. Then, before you
    knew it, we were into 1963, and Winston tasted &ldquo;good like a
    cigarette should,&rdquo; people were singing <i>Blowing in the Wind</i>,
    and movie-goers were being charmed by <i>Lilies of the Field</i>,
    amused by <i>Dr. Strangelove &ndash; or How I Stopped Worrying and
      Learned to Love the Bomb</i>, and thrilled by <i>The Great Escape</i>.&rdquo;
    Everybody relaxed a little, too, as the Atomic Test Ban Treaty was
    concluded. In June Good Pope John was succeeded by long-suffering
    Pope Paul, and Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman in space
    &ndash; thereby fulfilling every woman&rsquo;s ultimate dream,
    <i>weightlessness</i>.</p>
  <p class="western">This was about the time, too, when Anne and Doug,
    high school juniors, ran slightly afoul of the law. It seems they
    were bent on a late-evening group picnic to Brighton Dam. The crowd
    had plenty of beer but was slightly under age. Then suddenly the
    police struck and bedlam ensued. Doug, I think, was almost
    immediately caught, but Anne took off in the dark, running for her
    life through the woods, frightened out of her wits. I can well
    believe she must have been terrified, and I have no recollection of
    how she finally made her way home. Needless to say, her escape was
    all in vain, as everyone was tracked down via the ones who were
    caught. So it was that I paid the first of what was to be several
    trips to the police station on behalf of one or the other of our
    children. (Earlier on, Kathleen had marched George back to a Four
    Corners emporium to return a little car he had <i>just happened to
      pick up</i>.</p>
  <p class="western">Later I had to visit the Silver Spring station to
    free Moni from being held for sleeping in a car when she was
    supposed to be spending the night at Dorene Garvin&rsquo;s house.
    Still later, I had to free Mo from the Wheaton Ward&rsquo;s security
    police when she was apprehended for lifting a 45-rpm record. You
    might say she was made to &ldquo;face the music.&rdquo; I won&rsquo;t.
    In a somewhat similar vein, there was the time a young Johnny
    stumbled home almost dead drunk from &ldquo;true-proofing&rdquo; &ndash;
    sampling every jug &ndash; in the Shines&rsquo; bar. Anne&rsquo;s
    escape forced me to visit the Bethesda police station to witness her
    dressing-down by a plainclothesman. In the same room at a nearby
    table, Doug and his Dad were enacting a similar tableau. I didn&rsquo;t
    realize it then, but that was the only time I was ever even to see
    Doug&rsquo;s Dad. He died soon after of a heart attack. It&rsquo;s a
    wonder these antics didn&rsquo;t do me in, but in fact I think all
    our culprits would concede that they never saw me more cool or
    sympathetic &ndash; so chalk up a few points for good old Dad.</p>
  <p class="western">While Anne had been skipping through the fields
    at Brighton Dam, George was bouncing over the ocean waves on
    &ldquo;youngster&rdquo; cruise. Thanks to a letter to us (but
    retained by Grandma Kirk), we can let him describe it:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Youngster cruise is fun. The weather and
    the sea have been terrifically calm. I&rsquo;m working in the
    Electricians&rsquo; Shack now, and standing four-on, eight-off
    watches in the after engine room. This is an air-conditioned control
    booth with remote controls. Not like the old salt-tablet Navy, eh
    Dad? [Hey, son! <i>Now</i> you know who designed the first such
    control booth!] The firerooms are hotter, about 120 degrees, but one
    can usually stay in the control booth there or stand under an 8-inch
    air-conditioning duct when one is forced to go out of the booth.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The sea is so pretty! The water is such a
    pure, deep blue, so clean and clear. I went up on the fantail, and
    this is why I&rsquo;m really writing. The sunset was&hellip; No! I&rsquo;m
    not going to describe that, it was just glaring, actually. The
    prettier picture was seen with my back to the sunset. I was standing
    against the port lifeline. The water was absolutely smooth &ndash;
    so calm, but smoothly billowing. A slight hiss from the white foam
    boiling up from the bow knifing through the water was the only
    sound. The water next to the ship&rsquo;s hull was that clear blue,
    even more striking in contrast with the eddying, hissing white
    bubbles. The color of the water changed as I looked farther out from
    the ship toward the horizon. The blue gave way to a pink with
    touches of the lightest green. The pink surface was slashed with
    blue ribbons where the ripples were more steep. The pinkness
    extended further and further until it melted into a purple haze
    which suggested a horizon.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The purple haze lightened into a white
    which gradually turned blue as you raised your eyes. But there were
    two final touches that really made the picture. Off to the left
    there was an ivory-gray mysterious invasion on the scene, a
    submarine riding awash quietly. What a contrast! But the final
    touch, the thing that made the whole visual image seem like a
    surrealist collaboration between Claude Monet and some other French
    surrealist whose name I can&rsquo;t remember, was three small crates
    just heaved over the side. They were blackish blocks bobbing in the
    pinkness, growing smaller and bobbing, bobbing. (Sigh!) &ndash;
    Until my next soulful experience, musingly yours, s/George. [Well,
    Zane Grey never described a scene better. Makes you almost want to
    go to sea, doesn&rsquo;t it?]</p>
  <p class="western">Now we&rsquo;re into the terrible fall of 1963.
    Suddenly, JFK goes to Dallas, and then, even more suddenly, JFK is &hellip;
    gone! Blown away by a nobody named Oswald, who was the next day
    blown away by a nobody named Ruby. But there&rsquo;s hardly any need
    to elaborate this tragic period. <i>Everybody remembers where they
      were that day!</i> Mercifully we were soon into a new year &ndash;
    1964. The Berkeley campus in California was launching a youth
    totally disdainful of careers, clothes, politics, and religion &ndash;
    the whole civilized shtick! Congress enacted a Civil Rights Act,
    Khrushchev was deposed, Viet Nam was escalating, and the Beatles
    made their first visit to DC.</p>
  <p class="western">For me, this was one of my more prolific writing
    periods. I was already cranking out articles for an assortment of
    management and data processing magazines with such groovy titles as
    <i>Management Information System Distinctions; The Space/Time
      Analogy to Organization and Methods; To Digress on Progress: How
      Navy Saves Time; EDP solves a Problem; Navy Management and
      Electronic Computers: Economy Through Effectiveness; Integrated
      Information Systems and Management;</i> and <i>Who Really Has the
      Helm</i>.</p>
  <p class="western">I&rsquo;ve included brief excerpts from two of my
    favorites as exhibits in this magnum opus, one about personal
    <i>responsibility</i> (which I wish all current and future
    government servants would subscribe to), and one entitled <i>A New
      Breed: Info-maniacs</i>. I was surprised when the latter term didn&rsquo;t
    catch on. I thought it was so-o-o clever. On the whole, though, I
    confess that all this writing was pretty prosaic stuff. Dull! It did
    help pay the bills, though.</p>
  <p class="western">The year 1965 saw Martin Luther King launch his
    march to black freedom via Selma, even as LBJ launched his <i>Great
      Society</i>, and we launched ours: introducing air conditioning into
    our home in June, and installing our first <i>color</i> TV in
    October, while I now treated myself to lunch &ldquo;out&rdquo;
    almost every workday. I remember being alone at lunch one day at a
    now unremembered caf&eacute; next to the old Warner Theatre on 13th
    Street in downtown Washington. In such circumstances, and fancying
    myself as a potential author, it was my habit to eavesdrop &ndash;
    with often fascinating results. I was shocked this particular day to
    realize suddenly that a group of men behind me were discussing my
    area of professional endeavor and with particularly deprecating
    references to &ldquo;higher-ups&rdquo; whom I knew. I sat there
    enthralled as they downgraded every top Pentagon executive
    associated with the DOD computer program.</p>
  <p class="western">Little by little, I was able to piece things
    together so that I was finally able to identify the leading apostle
    of vilification. He had to be &ndash; let&rsquo;s call him Cal
    Benson &ndash; the DOD civilian official directly above our office
    in the organizational chain, a guy I had often spoken to on the
    phone and frequently exchanged correspondence with, but whom I had
    never met. As I rose to leave, I shuffled with my chair long enough
    to note that I knew no one at that table and vice versa. Thereupon I
    went directly to the head hatchet-man and said, &ldquo;You must be
    Cal Benson.&rdquo; He confessed. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I
    just want you to know I sure have enjoyed your conversation. Very
    interesting.&rdquo; He went into a sort of state of shock. &ldquo;Who
    did you say you were?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo;
    I replied and left. I just couldn&rsquo;t resist it. Sorry, Cal.</p>
  <p class="western">On 2 May 1965 Monica made her first communion. I
    don&rsquo;t remember this. Monica does. She recalls that afterward
    Kathleen and I took her out to breakfast at the Hot Shoppe that used
    to be near the Silver Theatre on Colesville Road near Georgia
    Avenue. But even more than the special breakfast, Moni remembers how
    she treasured a little silver rosary that came packed in a little
    white Bible-like box with a golden clasp. She thought it was just
    about the most precious thing she had ever owned in her entire life
    up to that point. I must sadly confess that I have absolutely no
    recollection of my own first communion. I&rsquo;m sure I detested
    all the practicing and standing in line which it must have entailed.
    And ever since I heard about it, I&rsquo;ve always felt jealous of
    Napoleon, who reportedly claimed that, rather than any battlefield
    victory, the day he made his first communion was the greatest day in
    his life. Like I said, I don&rsquo;t even remember mine. On the
    other hand,, I&rsquo;ll never have to look up Bob Wright&rsquo;s.
    How can anybody forget a date like 5-6-78?</p>
  <p class="western">At last, 1965 gradually crawled to a close. The
    war in Viet Nam continued to escalate, George was already in the
    service but considerably removed from imminent deployment, but
    Charlie and John were just 17 and 13 years old, respectively. No
    need to sweat &ndash; yet. On 9&ndash;10 Oct a massive electric
    power failure blacked out most of the northeastern U.S. and parts of
    two Canadian provinces. The lights started going off at 5:15 pm &ndash;
    the height of the evening rush hour, and by 5:27 pm New York City
    was totally dark. Approximately 80,000 square miles with a
    population of 30 million were affected. In New York City, 800,000
    were trapped in subways for hours. Thousands of others were trapped
    in elevators. Several comedies and at least one horror show have
    since been derived from this incident &ndash; all of which was
    caused by an incorrect setting of a small relay in 1963!</p>
  <p class="western">Somehow, this whole tragic comedy seems so
    symptomatic of the times. It provided a fitting symbolism to mark
    the close of what had been a very black year indeed. But, as is so
    often the case, even as a large part of the nation was bathed in
    darkness, a ray of light was emerging. Once again, perhaps, the
    Phoenix would rise from the ashes. Across the mighty Atlantic on 8
    Dec, Pope Paul brought Vatican II to a solemn close with the promise
    of an invigorating fresh breeze sweeping through the Church. It is
    only fitting, I think, that I marked this new beginning by changing
    jobs on 19 Dec. Well, I didn&rsquo;t <i>change</i> jobs, exactly. My
    old office was disestablished and I was <i>reassigned</i> &ndash; a
    euphemism for &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t got no vote, boy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">So, once again my career course changed with no
    input from me &ndash; no hand on the tiller. Now I would be in the
    Pentagon in the Office of Management Information, reporting directly
    to the Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Navy (SASN,
    pronounced &ldquo;sass-in,&rdquo; though before very long an office
    wit would embellish it to &ldquo;as-sass-in&rdquo; for reasons that
    will be elaborated in the following chapter.) In any case, I would
    now labor as a Supervising <i>Performance Analyst</i> at $19,415.
    This, however, doesn&rsquo;t begin to tell the significance of this
    turn of events. For one thing, though there was no immediate hint of
    it at the time, this change marked the apex of my career.
    Henceforth, I&rsquo;d be on the downward slope of the professional
    mountain. Worse than that, I would no longer cavort in a purely
    civilian milieu. Henceforth my ultimate superior would be swathed in
    blue and gold. I was back under the military thumb. Stay tuned!</p>

      XVI. BRASS</h2>
  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western">Those who cannot change their minds
    cannot change anything. <span style="font-style: normal">&ndash;&nbsp;George&nbsp;Bernard&nbsp;Shaw</span></p>
  <p class="western">The most frustrating aspect of the so-called
    military mind for me has always been its intractability. It&rsquo;s
    really quite fitting that the mule, renowned for its stubbornness,
    is the mascot/symbol of the Army. Believe me, the generals and
    admirals <i>have</i> to be the most obstinate people in the world.
    They make imperviousness to the powers of logical persuasion into a
    private religion. At the Naval Academy, we were penalized for
    saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir!&rdquo; Little wonder, then,
    that we were soon transformed into know-it-alls.</p>
  <p class="western">The Irish cherish the questionable notion that to
    apologize is a sign of weakness. In like manner, the military brass
    seemingly pays unswerving homage to the notion that to change one&rsquo;s
    mind &ndash; even in the face of overwhelmingly valid reasons for
    doing so (remember my last Skipper?) &ndash; is a sign of
    indecisiveness, which is perceived (and <i>is</i>, in certain
    circumstances) a fatal military weakness. It is the generals and
    admirals who have undoubtedly given birth to the clich&eacute;:
    &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t confuse me with facts, my mind is made up!&rdquo;
    Well, by now you get the point: It&rsquo;s damn difficult for any
    reasonably intelligent civilian to work in a militarily dominated
    milieu, but such was to be my lot, and the proof of the preceding
    thesis was to be almost immediately forthcoming.</p>
  <p class="western">My new boss was an admiral of Dutch stock whom we
    shall for charitable purposes dub Admiral Mallon. He had to be the
    original model for the stereotypical stubborn Dutchman, and, he was
    &hellip; DENSE. At least once a week the Special Assistant to the
    SecNav (SASN) would call a staff conference of the Admiral and the
    latter&rsquo;s division heads and their assistants. As one of the
    latter I was in regular attendance. Well, the SASN himself was a
    &ldquo;debacle waiting to happen,&rdquo; being a stereotype of the
    crass, brash, crude, rude, loud-mouth, Hollywood-type mogul
    transplanted to a government executive-level setting only a little
    less formal and stylish than a Victorian-era British tea party. He
    stood out as conspicuously as an obscene word shouted in the midst
    of a baptismal ceremony. Worse than that, he thought he was a real
    man and a &ldquo;mover and shaker&rdquo; rushing to the rescue of a
    decaying and degenerating governmental process. He&rsquo;d get us
    all &ldquo;off our ass&rdquo; soon enough. He&rsquo;d &ldquo;get the
    show on the road.&rdquo; He reminded me of the old mess-cook cry
    aboard ship: &ldquo;Hot stuff coming through!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">The SASN was both too obsequious to those up the
    line, like his superiors in OSD, and too contemptuous of those down
    the line, which certainly included me, but especially included dumb
    old Adm. Mallon. I remember trying to shrink out of sight one day
    when the SASN entertained a visit from an OSD superior in his
    office. At one point the SASN, in indecorous shirtsleeves, actually
    got up from his desk, bounced over to the settee on which his OSD
    guest was seated, fell to his knees groveling, and pleaded wildly,
    &ldquo;Just tell us what you want, Al, old boy, and we&rsquo;ll get
    it for you. Just tell us what you need, Al!&rdquo; Ugh.</p>
  <p class="western">What an unsightly contrast to our former top
    boss, the Administrative Assistant to SecNav (AASN), the suave,
    poised, dignified John H. Dillon. Mr. Dillon had served five
    presidents, through two changes of administration from one party to
    the other. He began his service as a Marine Major on the staff of
    FDR&rsquo;s WWII SecNav, Frank Knox. He was the one who provided the
    &ldquo;pass-down-the-line&rdquo; continuity from one SecNav to
    another, the one unchanging pillar of administrative savvy and
    wisdom. He was a soft-spoken gentleman of highly incisive mind, and
    he dealt with his OSD <i>peers</i> in a spirit of equality and
    decorum. He oozed class. What a contrast! The old boss made you feel
    proud to be associated with him. The new boss left you embarrassed
    and dismayed.</p>
  <p class="western">The way the SASN dealt with Adm. Mallon was
    almost obscene. He seemed to have a sadistic streak not unlike that
    too often encountered in young nuns, who seemingly relished
    ridiculing and demeaning their charges into helpless, insecure
    wretches. Whenever Mallon misspoke &ndash; which was virtually every
    time he opened his mouth &ndash; the SASN would be on him like a dog
    with a new bone, and he couldn&rsquo;t any more let go than a member
    of the press with a weeping witness. He&rsquo;d just keep attacking.
    We&rsquo;d all have to sit there squirming as he verbally undressed
    our new boss before our very eyes. This went on week after week, and
    the admiral himself would only exacerbate the situation. The SASN
    would ask a question. The admiral would give the wrong answer. Then
    the SASN would repeatedly give broader and broader hints at the
    correct answer and repeat the question. Through all this, the stupid
    admiral would persist in <i>the same wrong answer</i>!</p>
  <p class="western">It was incredible. You couldn&rsquo;t do a thing.
    You just had to sit there. Of course, too, you realized that every
    demeaning of the admiral also diminished you. Indeed, I was clearly
    now on the toboggan on the downhill side of the career curve. The
    most stark aspect of this unhappy turn of events was that I myself
    had absolutely no voice, vote or veto with respect to my own fate &ndash;
    beyond quitting, of course. It&rsquo;s all reminiscent of my old NMO
    boss, Henry Hill&rsquo;s characterization of life: It&rsquo;s like
    we&rsquo;re all a bunch of ants on this log that&rsquo;s shooting
    down the rapids and we&rsquo;re arguing over who&rsquo;s steering.&rdquo;
    I must admit that my own life&rsquo;s course has often seemed to
    parallel that depiction.</p>
  <p class="western">This, then, was the situation in which I found
    myself as we began 1966. You&rsquo;ve now got a good idea of the bad
    atmosphere in which I was to operate. You must further realize that
    the cavalier treatment of the admiral by the SASN just made the
    admiral that much more intractable in his dealings with us. It
    should be evident that when there is absolutely no chance of
    changing someone&rsquo;s mind, then you have been totally stripped
    of any executive effectiveness, and become little more than an
    administrative eunuch. Such was to increasingly become my fate over
    the next few years &ndash; the final years of my public service. I
    was converted from <i>aspiring and perspiring</i> to <i>conniving
      and surviving</i>. I was just another pebble in that great
    brick-house of bureaucracy that was the Pentagon.</p>
  <p class="western">Of course, I <i>did</i> have a few perks. One was
    that I had all solid oak and completely upholstered furniture rather
    than the ugly modern metal stuff. Another was that I had reserved
    parking in the closest possible proximity to my office. This was
    especially good, since removal to the Pentagon displaced me from the
    many luncheon restaurants in ready walking distance from Main Navy.
    Now I had to drive to lunch (and could make it to St. Dominic&rsquo;s
    noon Mass on Holy Days and during Lent), but that meant another set
    of restaurants, and Ryan&rsquo;s Bar and Grill (now L&rsquo;Enfant
    Plaza) became a favorite. So, all was not yet lost. One could still
    ride away from it all &ndash; for a time.</p>
  <p class="western">Ah, 1966! Bouffants, Black Power, Black Panthers,
    Black is Beautiful, and Ban the Bra! These were the &ldquo;in&rdquo;
    things. Current bumper stickers included &ldquo;Warning! Your Local
    Police Are Armed and Dangerous,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve Gone to
    Pot,&rdquo; &ldquo;Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out,&rdquo; &ldquo;Get
    Your Act Together,&rdquo; and &ldquo;God Is Dead.&rdquo; This was
    the time of Timothy Leary and LSD, the Weathermen, urban riots,
    Charlie Brown, and <i>Hare Krishna</i>. John MacDonald has the right
    idea about the latter: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m turned off by humorless
    fanaticism, whether it&rsquo;s revolutionary mumbo-jumbo by a young
    one, or loud lessons from the Scripture by an old one.&rdquo; Race
    riots even came to DC, and we&rsquo;d had 43 nationally by year&rsquo;s
    end. Andy Warhol was blurring all art by portraying a can of
    Campbell&rsquo;s soup. <i>NOW</i> was founded to promote the era of
    the <i>Feminine Mystique</i>. All in all, it didn&rsquo;t seem like
    the most propitious time to be raising a large family.</p>

    <i>SOLIDARITY DAY</i> &ndash; June 19, 1966</h3>
  <p class="western">By now, of course, it was too late for us &ndash;
    not that we&rsquo;d have had it any other way &ndash; we were
    committed. In this perilous period of the last half of the 1960s,
    our nine children ranged in age from 21 to six, and all of them were
    in school, from elementary through college. During this period, we
    always had <i>four</i> teenagers in the house. We were confronting
    this most troubling of times head-on. It was worrisome, to say the
    least.</p>
  <p class="western">Not the least of it was George&rsquo;s
    bittersweet graduation from the Naval Academy that June. It would
    not be appropriate to this autobiography to elaborate George&rsquo;s
    personal frustrations (a foundering engagement) even if they were
    fully known &ndash; which they&rsquo;re not. Let&rsquo;s just say
    that the spirit of what could and should have been a most happy time
    was considerably dampened. Truly, things were then going sour all
    over. Of course, in the light of since revealed more joyful
    developments, all of this is much easier to take in retrospect.
    Still, for the entire family, as well as George, it was a most
    poignant period in our life story. To jump slightly ahead in our
    story for a moment, a short note from George (then in Meridian,
    Mississippi) dated 10 Jan 1967 will give you the flavor of the
    times:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">This is a rather strange kind of
    multi-purpose letter. It&rsquo;s mainly a letter of thanks. Tom and
    I surely did enjoy the time we spent at home. I wish we could have
    spent more time there, and I hope you don&rsquo;t feel that ignored
    or slighted the family. It&rsquo;s just that the last one was about
    the loneliest Christmas I ever had, and going off to buy a new bike
    was about the only thing that kept me from a state of constant
    self-pity. Right now I&rsquo;m trying (unsuccessfully as yet) to get
    back into the swing of flying. It seems I&rsquo;ve lost all my
    acquired skill and that another uphill struggle is in order. And, on
    top of it all, I was turning left at an intersection and the VW was
    struck on the side by a car that was passing a van behind me! s/Your
    plumbing son, George. P.S. &ndash; a plumber is someone who is as
    skilled and at home in the cockpit as, say, a plumber.</p>
  <p class="western">On 1 July, France withdrew from NATO and LBJ
    crowned his Great Society by inaugurating Medicare. On the office
    front we were both <i>conducting</i> studies and the <i>object</i>
    of studies. You must realize that &ldquo;study&rdquo; is a euphemism
    for &ldquo;boondoggle.&rdquo; The purposes of any &ldquo;study&rdquo;
    that ever was or ever will be (at least in government) are twofold:
    (1) to justify what is already being done, and (2) to substantiate a
    case for raising selected salaries. The first question of any
    self-respecting authority reviewing or approving studies should be:
    &ldquo;Who gets the raises?&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">This reminds me of a purportedly true story told
    to me by a now dead office associate who once labored in the very
    top echelon of IBM. At that time IBM had its top dog and he had two
    vice presidential &ldquo;special assistants.&rdquo; This was then
    the structure of the apex of the management pyramid. Well, the head
    honcho one day called in his two veeps and said something to the
    effect that he thought the organization could be more streamlined
    for improved efficiency, and the two veeps were thereupon
    commissioned to come up with proposed organization charts. It seems
    that in due course each veep would come up in turn with a proposed
    organization, but invariably the chief would look at it briefly and
    dismiss it out of hand with a &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it!&rdquo; At
    long last one of the veeps came up with a chart that omitted the
    other veep. The chief immediately seized his hand in a
    congratulatory shake, exclaiming, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s
    it!&rdquo; But the punch line of this true story was still to come:
    &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s why to this day you never see an
    organization chart for IBM. Nobody has the guts to risk making one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">As we moved into the fall of 1966, we acquired a
    new beige-colored Corvair sedan from the now long-gone Tom&rsquo;s
    Chevrolet in Wheaton, but the thoughts of Kathleen and I suddenly
    turned rather to highways in the sky. We reasoned that George would
    soon be coming home on Christmas leave from flight school in
    Pensacola. We just knew he would be deluging us with flight jargon,
    and so we thought it behooved us to get knowledgeable on the subject
    &ndash; well, at least semi-literate. So, we proceeded to read every
    book in the library about flight training. Then, almost before we
    knew it, we were enrolled in ground school! Well, this was a totally
    new field for us, and a very exciting one. Our excitement was
    heightened by the fact that this was all to be a surprise for
    George. We hoped to be able to talk to him on his own terms. of
    course, another aspect of this effort was that it ushered in a whole
    series of extracurricular efforts upon which Kathleen and I would
    embark &ndash; TOGETHER!</p>
  <p class="western">This is no small thing. So many spouses seem to
    pursue their separate avocations, and in the process unwittingly
    drift apart. All of our forays afield from home were mutual affairs,
    joint ventures. We attended ground school together. We initiated
    flight training together. We took our FAA exams together
    (progressing through private, commercial, and instrument exams &ndash;
    all passed). Thereafter we attended a course in sailing together,
    religious education course together, golf lessons together, German
    lessons together, a course in CPR together. This didn&rsquo;t mean
    we didn&rsquo;t at the same time retain some measure of &ldquo;our
    own space.&rdquo; we each had some separate interests, too, but all
    the big things we did together. We commend this approach to our
    married progeny.</p>
  <p class="western">We were suddenly into 1967. Everyone should
    remember that year, since, as John Mosedale has said, &ldquo;Sex was
    invented in 1967 or thereabouts.&rdquo; It was also the time of the
    tragic death of three Apollo Program astronauts on the pad at Cape
    Kennedy in a flash fire. This was also the year of the first heart
    transplant by Dr. Christiaan Barnard, and the time of riots in all
    our big industrial cities. Kids everywhere were singing &ldquo;Where
    Have All the Flowers Gone?&rdquo; In Nov 1966 Edmund Brooke
    (Massachusetts) had become the first black senator in 85 years, and
    in Oct 1967 Thurgood Marshall became the first black Supreme Court
    Justice, ever, while in Nov 1967 blacks gained their first mayors in
    major U.S. cities with Stokes in Cleveland and Hatcher in Gary,
    Indiana. The middle of the year was punctuated by the Arab-Israeli
    <i>Six-Day War</i>, in which Israel gained a territory four times
    its original size. At the height of this short war, the Israelis
    sank the U.S. communications ship <i>Liberty</i>, resulting in 34
    American deaths and 75 wounded. They subsequently &ldquo;apologized&rdquo;
    for the &ldquo;accident.&rdquo; (Can you imagine the hullabaloo over
    a similar accident &ldquo;in reverse&rdquo;?)</p>
  <p class="western">On the home front, I completed 30 years of
    government service on 28 Jan 1967. I got a &ldquo;pin,&rdquo; which
    I promptly lost. So it goes, but it still wasn&rsquo;t going too
    well with George. A letter dated 22 May 1967 is indicative:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">First I want to ask what Dad meant when he
    wrote that he &ldquo;practiced&rdquo; Dutch rolls. From what I
    learned, a Dutch roll is a characteristic of aircraft that have an
    excess stability, not an acrobatic maneuver. Was this little gem a
    &ldquo;test&rdquo;? [Well, not exactly. It was my instructor&rsquo;s
    sarcastic comment on my propensity to over-control. I never could
    tell a joke. George then launched into a lengthy description of a
    dive on a wreck off Pensacola (which turned up less loot than they
    finally found in the <i>Andrea Doria</i>&rsquo;s safe), and how they
    were organized to harpoon stingrays &ndash; and I wonder whatever
    happened to his stingray-barb letter opener? More to the point, and
    speaking of possible &ldquo;leave&rdquo; between Pensacola and
    Corpus Christi, George then continued.]</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The story goes that not long ago some
    people requested extra leave between here and Corpus to get married,
    22 people in fact. And when they got to Corpus they found the C.O.
    had invited them to a reception for all the newlyweds. The rub came
    when only three (count &rsquo;em!) couples showed up. Since this sad
    occasion, other people are a little more cautious in claiming
    marriage as a reason for extra leave. [You see, Watergate morality
    was already underway.]</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Things have been rather tense around the
    squadron for the past few days. Last Thursday it all started when
    the X.O. went home for lunch and hung himself instead in the garage.
    This would seem to me to indicate clearly that all was not well with
    the X.O. and/or his family. With this in mind, it seemed rather
    strange that there appeared a recommendation that all students
    attend a full-scale memorial service with service dress white and
    everything. That was today. I didn&rsquo;t go, because I don&rsquo;t
    think I could stand listening to the minister&rsquo;s eulogy. I
    rather regret not going now, because I think the eulogy probably
    would have been a masterpiece of &ldquo;tact,&rdquo; i.e., speaking
    for a long time without really saying anything definite. Maybe I do
    the minister a disservice by judging a sermon I never heard. But the
    idea of trying to deliver a eulogy on a suicide in the context of an
    it&rsquo;s-strongly-recommended-that-all-students-attend memorial
    service seems to me the type of thing I would shun if I were an
    honest minister.</p>
  <p class="western">Of course, nothing is ever all bad. In between
    downers George did enjoy an occasional upper, like his foray with
    Tom in February to the New Orleans <i>Mardi Gras</i>. Let&rsquo;s
    let George tell about it:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Just got back from the most all-time show
    ever seen by this reporter, namely, <i>Mardi Gras</i> weekend in New
    Orleans. And it was for less than ten dollars! Tom and I left (from
    Meridian) late Friday night on our bikes and pulled into
    Fontainebleau State Park four hours later. Establishing ourselves by
    about 2300, we lay in our bags in Tom&rsquo;s new tent passing a
    flask back and forth until we fell asleep. As we straightened up
    next morning prior to motoring 20 miles into New Orleans, a fellow a
    little younger than we came over wearing a sailor&rsquo;s peacoat
    and French sailor&rsquo;s hat. He and his buddy were in N.O. on a
    last fling prior to going into Army boot camp. The tales he told and
    the suggestions he gave had us ready to start on an interesting
    Saturday. [Why do I start suspecting at this point that this letter
    from George is reminiscent of my previously elaborated &ldquo;Bermuda
    letter&rdquo;?] Then a man about your age came over and allowed as
    how he used to bike before he broke his hip (whether on a bike or
    not he didn&rsquo;t say). As the weather report he&rsquo;d seen on
    his trailer&rsquo;s TV had predicted a cold Friday night, he figured
    we could use some coffee to warm us up. He and his wife, down from
    N.Y. on a trip to California, saved us time and money for breakfast
    as well as providing some interesting conversation.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">We next motored down to the N.O. scene just
    as the twelve o&rsquo;clock whistle blew. Parking the bikes on a
    parking lot, we stored our helmets and about two layers of
    insulation in a bus terminal locker, for the temperature was warming
    as the afternoon wore on. First order of business was to recharge
    the flasks, of course, as we had already had breakfast. It would be
    impossible to describe everything. We went to see the French
    helicopter-carrier ASW vessel, <i>Jean D&rsquo;Arc</i>. As we
    wandered back into town, the day&rsquo;s first parade was coming by.
    Tom and I managed to catch enough souvenir necklaces to keep us in
    stock for a long time. After the parade things really began to get
    good. We went down to the Square and flopped out on the grass and
    just stared.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Such a collection you wouldn&rsquo;t
    believe. Take a look at the <i>Lovin&rsquo; Spoonful</i> and <i>Rolling
      Stones</i> albums and imagine a whole block full of that kind of
    people sitting, sprawling, meandering almost arm-in-arm with matrons
    in sequined gowns and high heels with their tuxedoed husbands. We
    sat and watched an old &ldquo;nigra&rdquo; fellow about 60, I guess,
    who was playing guitar, Mississippi-John-Hurt style. He was drinking
    something out of a &ldquo;Genuine Dixie Beer&rdquo; bottle which,
    from its effects, wasn&rsquo;t Genuine Dixie Beer. I hope my
    pictures come out!</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The night was just unbelievable. The
    streets were impassable to traffic for all the people. The gutters
    were ankle deep in beer cans The streets were full of drinking
    American sailors and drinking French sailors. An almost
    clich&eacute;-seeming scene was commonplace: a French sailor would
    come strolling down the street with a bottle in his left hand, his
    arm around a girl, and a French-English dictionary clutched in his
    right hand. After we got our fill of talking to well-lubricated
    people and watching the day&rsquo;s second parade, we headed back
    and got to bed even earlier than Friday. We returned to Meridian
    early Sunday morning. So, I had an all-time weekend on little money,
    without even losing sleep, and I even had Sunday left over. It&rsquo;s
    too bad you&rsquo;ll have to settle for only a written description
    of it. Adios. s/George. [This was the last written letter we ever
    got from George. No! He didn&rsquo;t disappear from the face of the
    earth. He bought a typewriter. Where&rsquo;s your sense of humor?]</p>
  <p class="western">Meanwhile, Kathleen and I were off and flying &ndash;
    literally. We obtained our student pilot licenses on 28 Feb 1967 and
    began our flight instruction on 4 Apr 1967. We financed this venture
    by the simple expedient of cashing in expensive-to-maintain life
    insurance policies. I &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; the time from the
    office for lessons by scheduling them before work on weekday
    mornings and doubling up on weekends. It was a most joyous and
    exciting spring. Here we were on the verge of fifty, reaching for
    the sky. Wonderful! I had the same instructor throughout my
    training. Kathleen had a different but equally excellent one for her
    first few lessons, and then she shifted to my instructor when hers
    suddenly took off for Indiana. (We like to think it wasn&rsquo;t to
    get away from Kathleen&rsquo;s <i>controlled-crash</i> landings, but
    <i>whyinhell</i> would anyone ever want to go to Indiana?)</p>

    Meridian MI, Macho-man &ndash; December 6, 1966</h3>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, our main man was Ron Barnhart, a native
    of Mt. Airy. Even as he trained us he was qualifying in
    multi-engines for an eventual airline pilot job with Allegheny, now
    USAir. He was good. He gave me several &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; omitted
    from Kathleen&rsquo;s curriculum: like having me land on the grass
    at Montgomery Airpark beyond the end of the runway; releasing me
    from under the &ldquo;hood&rdquo; (which prevents seeing out of the
    cockpit when practicing instrument flight) either in a small cloud
    or over the threshold; and putting me (illegally, since we weren&rsquo;t
    wearing chutes) into a tailspin. I was amazed by the <i>d&eacute;j&agrave;
      vu</i> aspect of the latter. It seems we had had that eye-view so
    often before via the medium of the movies and TV that we&rsquo;d
    surely done it before. Yes, boys and girls, it&rsquo;s just like in
    the movies &ndash; only you have to get out of it. Fun, fun, fun!
    (Rally!) Ron also gave George his first check-ride as a civilian
    after his crash. He was highly amused when George asked, &ldquo;Where
    is the G-meter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, Kathleen and I took out first flights on
    4 Apr 1967. By 21 Apr (as we didn&rsquo;t fly every day, of course!)
    we were doing power-on and power-off stalls and steep 720-degree
    turns. Now, there&rsquo;s a thrill-and-a-half, and quite near enough
    to acrobatics for me. On 22 May came George&rsquo;s last letter from
    Meridian as he was already looking forward to Texas:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">They don&rsquo;t waste much time down here.
    I&rsquo;m three-quarters through my form transition hops. I&rsquo;ll
    start gunnery probably late next week. Ten gunnery hops and eleven
    carrier hops later (assuming I can convince my instructor I&rsquo;m
    proficient enough throughout) and I&rsquo;ll be on my way to Texas&hellip;
    If I were to hit things right I could end up with seventeen days
    free &hellip; and I&rsquo;ll be able to make it home sometime &hellip;
    between here and Texas. Of course by the time I get home you&rsquo;ll
    both be big time aviators. And this means you&rsquo;ll take me up
    for a ride. Will you be allowed to take up passengers with the type
    of license you will have? I hope so, because I sure would like to go
    up once without worrying about fulfilling a syllabus. I would
    imagine it would be a bit easier to relax and enjoy the entire deal
    if you knew you weren&rsquo;t being graded on everything you were
    doing from pre-flight to final shutdown. Another thing about the
    planes I&rsquo;m flying now, I&rsquo;m always up so high that
    there&rsquo;s no real sense of motion, no real sense of doing
    anything but influencing the readings on the instruments by
    adjustment of nose attitude. Back in the good old days at Saufley,
    we would cruise around low enough to distinguish things on the
    ground.</p>
  <p class="quote-western"><i>I honestly think if there hadn&rsquo;t
    been so much competition and social pressure to go to Meridian and
    be hot jet jocks I would have gone to helicopters.</i> (Then how
    different Chapter <a href="#crash">XVII. CRASH</a> of this opus
    might have been! Who knows?) The only trouble with Navy helicopters
    though is that all they seem to do is hover off the quarter of a
    carrier to pick up all the hot jet jocks that crash on take-off or
    landing. The nice thing is that every limb has a control to
    manipulate. Much more motor skill is involved. [Well, Gary ought to
    like that!] Ah, perhaps I&rsquo;ll end up in choppers anyway. There
    seems to be a shortage of them now, chopper pilots, that is, not
    choppers&hellip; Until next time, remember: the quick brown fox
    jumped over the lazy dog. Typographically, s/George.</p>
  <p class="western">Well you get the general idea here &ndash; at
    this point in time the lives of Kathleen, and I, and George were all
    closely interwoven through the shared interest and concentration on
    flying. We couldn&rsquo;t know it then, of course, but in viewing
    all this in retrospect, mindful of the near-tragic conclusion of
    George&rsquo;s professional flying career, this peculiar
    preoccupation on our part would seem most providential. Elaboration
    of this point can be deferred to a later chapter, however, and it
    now remains only to detail our further progress through 1967. We
    never got as high as George, of course, but the very prospect of
    great heights had a salutary effect on my life.</p>
  <p class="western">Early on in ground school we had a lecture on
    hypoxia (acute oxygen deficiency, a possible consequence of
    high-altitude flight). The word was that you <i>had</i> to use
    supplementary oxygen above 14,000 feet and it was recommended even
    above 10,000 feet. It was also pointed out that with supplementary
    oxygen in the cockpit you had an extremely dangerous fire hazard.
    Smoking under such conditions was taboo. It was also emphasized that
    hypoxia struck heavy smokers at even lower altitudes. Well, I
    forthwith gave up smoking &ndash; for all time &ndash; on 29 Jan
    1967! I wasn&rsquo;t fully to realize the good fortune of that move
    until recovering from my heart surgery in 1981, about which more
    later.</p>
  <p class="western">On 10 Jun 1967 I completed my first solo after 18
    hours of instruction. This was to be the most unparalleled thrill of
    my entire life. How does one describe the indescribable? All I can
    say is that you haven&rsquo;t really felt exhilaration until you
    suddenly for the first time find yourself in the sky &ndash; totally
    alone &ndash; floating there above the ground, master of all you
    survey. The catalyst of this exhilaration is the realization that
    you and you alone are the one who has to safely manage a smooth
    reunion with the rather solid earth. Nobody else can help you.
    <i>NOBODY!</i> It&rsquo;s the ultimate satisfaction of the old
    plaint, &ldquo;Please, mother, I&rsquo;d rather do it myself.&rdquo;
    For once in your life, you&rsquo;re master of your own destiny &ndash;
    provided, of course, the engine doesn&rsquo;t quit, or the weather
    suddenly go haywire. Anyhow, my instructor and the resident FAA
    check-rider celebrated with me by sharing beers in their private
    room at the airport. I confess I felt every solo flight an
    adventure. I may as well have been on my way to the moon. My spirits
    were!</p>
  <p class="western">Kathleen felt this same exhilaration on 22 Jul
    1967 after 27 hours of instruction. Don&rsquo;t forget, she had no
    previous technical education such as I had enjoyed. I&rsquo;ve
    always thought our accomplishments in this area at our age were
    equally remarkable, and we weren&rsquo;t through yet. On 4 Aug I
    enjoyed my first solo cross-country flight from Gaithersburg to
    Easton, across the bay. On 2 Sep I grabbed an hour of dual out of
    Washington National (the guy had me practice stall recoveries), and
    so got to take off and land at DCA! On 4 Sep I got my Private
    Pilot&rsquo;s license. On the 14th &ndash; <i>our 25th wedding
      anniversary</i> &ndash; I took up my <i>first</i> passenger,
    Kathleen. We then celebrated the dual event with martinis at the
    Washingtonian Motel en route home. The bill including tip was a mere
    $4.50, but you couldn&rsquo;t buy the joy in our hearts on that
    occasion at any price! Kathleen cross-country soloed on 23 Sep and
    had her Private Pilot&rsquo;s license by 31 Oct. Now we were ready
    for the world. Katie and John were our first passengers (23 Sep
    1967), then Charlie (3 Oct), Mary and Monica (4 Oct), and Katie and
    John again (21 Oct). Gary and Martha waited until 27 Apr 1968, and
    Mo (with Moni again) made it aloft on 14 Jun 1968. Chicken Anne only
    flew with George.<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote59anc" href="#sdendnote59sym"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
  <p class="western">Welcome, 1968! William Manchester calls it &ldquo;the
    year that everything went wrong.&rdquo; Others refer to it broadly
    as &ldquo;the cataclysm of the sixties.&rdquo; It was the time of
    <i>Hair</i>, Tiny Tim, and the Hong Kong flu. Katie Hepburn starred
    in <i>The Lion in Winter</i>, Mia divorced Old Blue Eyes, Julie
    married David, and the Smothers Brothers TV show was censored when
    TV execs blipped out an anti-war song by Pete Seeger. On 29 Feb the
    Koerner Commission concluded that white racism was the cause of
    black riots &ndash; this a mere five weeks before the assassination
    of Dr. King on 2 Apr. A popular bumper sticker implored, &ldquo;Little
    Orphan Annie, Call Your Eye Bank!&rdquo; The U.S, population hit the
    two billion mark. Another bumper sticker exclaimed, &ldquo;George
    Wallace, Your Sheets Are Ready.&rdquo; The U.S, submarine <i>Scorpion</i>
    foundered with the loss of 99 lives. There were 21 major campus
    riots. There would be 221 major demonstrations between I Jan and 15
    Jun against war and/or racism. Things got so bad that on 31 Mar, LBJ
    commandeered TV to proclaim, &ldquo;I shall not seek, and I will not
    accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your
    president.&rdquo; And this wasn&rsquo;t even the worst of it.</p>

    Author over Bay Bridge &ndash; April 13, 1968</h3>
  <p class="western">On 23 Jan the North Koreans seized the <i>USS
    Pueblo</i>, which was under the command of Boystown product Cdr.
    Lloyd Bucher. I have read every book, pro and con, on this subject
    that I could lay my hands on, and I must confess that Bucher still
    strikes an ambivalent chord in my consciousness. Hero or scapegoat
    or coward? I wouldn&rsquo;t even hazard a guess. A classmate of mine
    was a member of his Court Martial board. This would be Adm. Al
    Bergner, born in Kankakee, IL, football captain and All-American at
    USNA, and now a resident of Onancock, VA, on the Eastern Shore. I
    knew Al a little better than I knew the vast majority of my
    classmates, having once been on his sailboat crew at the Academy.
    From such close observation I concluded that he was no
    phony-baloney, and not a knee-jerk flag-waver, either. I carefully
    audited all of his reported remarks after the trial. They struck me
    as very measured, cautious, reserved. I got the impression he shared
    my ambivalence.</p>
  <p class="western">There&rsquo;s no doubt Bucher could have become
    an all-time hero of the first rank had he chosen to put up a
    foredoomed fight. It would have been more in the Navy&rsquo;s
    tradition, but I doubt there would have been any American survivors.
    On the other hand, there is no doubt that American prestige in the
    world was dealt an extremely costly blow. Worse than that, it seems
    to me that Bucher&rsquo;s motives were less than altruistic. Again,
    on the other hand, he was poorly served by his subordinates, peers,
    and superiors both before and after the incident. On balance, I&rsquo;d
    have to say the jury is still out on this one. In any event, he and
    his men were freed on 22 Dec 1968.</p>
  <p class="western">Precisely a week after the <i>Pueblo</i> incident
    hit the headlines, the Tet offensive hit our forces in Viet Nam. As
    our fighting men struggled on the ground and in the air and on the
    sea there, our diplomats struggled in the U.N. It seems, however,
    that LBJ took a dim view of the U.N. He remarked at the time, &ldquo;It
    couldn&rsquo;t pour piss out of boot if the instructions were
    written on the heel.&rdquo; No diplomat, LBJ. But even this wasn&rsquo;t
    the end of our troubles this miserable year in U.S. history. On 4
    Apr Martin Luther King was shot. This set off riots in 125 American
    cities in 29 states, often necessitating the calling out of the
    National Guard to augment the police. Our own Washington, DC, was
    hit the worst, logging <i>711 fires</i>! I can remember being in a
    bus slowly working its way up 16th Street at this time, staring in
    shock at the 14th Street skyline, pierced by billowing black smoke
    punctuated by leaping tongues of fire darting well above the two-
    and three-story buildings that intervened between the two parallel
    streets. You prayed that your bus wouldn&rsquo;t stop, that it would
    get through, you mentally contemplated a footrace to the relative
    safety of the suburbs. You actually wondered if you were going to
    make it. It was scary. And when next we ventured back into town to
    go to work, it was really eerie &ndash; seeing fully outfitted and
    <i>armed</i> National Guardsmen posted on just about every street
    corner, and all sorts of military vehicles dashing madly up and down
    through the traffic. For our beloved country, believe me, it was
    almost unreal.</p>
  <p class="western">Still, through it all, life went on. So did work.
    It might change, but it never ceased, and mine did change. On 19 May
    1968, I was once again <i>reassigned</i>. Forthwith I was
    transferred from that virtual citadel, the Pentagon, to the center
    of our &ldquo;sacked city&rdquo; at 16th and L Streets. Way to go.
    My job designation was changed, too, from Performance Analyst to
    Program Analyst. Don&rsquo;t ask me what&rsquo;s the difference. I
    never could figure it out. At a then princely $21,469 annual salary
    I didn&rsquo;t really care. Meanwhile, as though I wasn&rsquo;t yet
    near enough to the heart of the DC disaster area, we moved a little
    farther east a few months later to 15th and L Streets. At this
    latter spot I at least got a parking spot, even if it did entail
    shoehorning into a Lilliputian alley alcove. You really hated to
    have to go to your car after dark in this neighborhood, especially
    in an unlighted spot like this. Suddenly, I wasn&rsquo;t working so
    late, so often, anymore.</p>
  <p class="western">The only other redeeming feature of this
    neighborhood was my discovery of really <i>hot</i> chili at the
    nearby New York Lounge. I don&rsquo;t remember how long we stayed
    there, or when we finally made our move to a brand new building in
    mushrooming Crystal City across the Potomac in Virginia, just west
    of National Airport. There I had my plushest quarters yet &ndash;
    floor-to-ceiling curtained windows on two sides, an oversized desk &ndash;
    the works. It has since been quartered into four offices! One thing
    for sure, I was damn glad to get out of DC. Henceforth I&rsquo;d
    groove to and from work via the GW Memorial Parkway and the Beltway.
    It was eight miles longer than driving through town, but the driving
    time was the same &ndash; and a helluva lot easier on the nerves. So
    ends this short but hectic chapter of my life.</p>

  <p class="western">It was raining. The time was about 1513 on a
    fairly balmy fall afternoon in Washington, DC. The date was 3 Oct
    1968 &ndash; then celebrated as the feast of St. Therese, the <i>Little
      Flower</i>. I responded to an ostensibly routine phone ring in my
    office. A gentleman identified himself as Cdr. William Parrish,
    Executive Officer of Fighter Squadron 124 (VF-124), then based at
    Miramar Naval Air Station, San Diego, CA. He very much regretted to
    have to inform me that our son, George, had sustained an air crash
    at Approximately 0740 that morning in the desert about 26 miles east
    of NAF El Centro, CA (which is about 40 miles west of Yuma, AZ, and
    15 miles north of the Mexican border), while a member of a
    four-plane Mk-76 (20# practice bomb) strafe practice mission. These
    were designed to increase the proficiency and accuracy of squadron
    pilots in an air-to-ground delivery environment then so germane to
    our activities in Viet Nam. He further advised that George had been
    evacuated to Balboa Naval Hospital, San Diego, where his condition
    was &ldquo;<i>guarded</i>,&rdquo; which he interpreted as being very
    serious. Further information would be provided as it became
    available.</p>
  <p class="western"><i>D&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>! I had been this
    route before. Way back on the beautiful spring afternoon, 12 Apr
    1945, I had similarly responded to a seemingly innocuous ring of the
    phone via the shore-connected phone line to the <i>USS Amsterdam</i>,
    then docked for post-shakedown overhaul in Norfolk, VA. Uncle Bernie
    regretted to inform me that my father had died suddenly that morning
    of a heart attack. For my part, I must confess that an eerie
    serenity engulfs one at such moments. Time is suddenly suspended.
    One drifts off into a sort of dream. The profound mystery of life
    seizes the consciousness. Mental concentration as well as the
    possibility of physical movement are briefly paralyzed. A weird kind
    of panorama unfolds before the eyes. Meanwhile we stand suspended
    and stricken in solitary grief as an unseeing world seems to hurl
    itself onward through space, passing in quiet review. John D.
    MacDonald captures the mood precisely in <i>A Deadly Shade of Gold</i>:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The stars &hellip; look down on a world
    where thousands of 4-H kids are raising prize cattle or sheep. The
    Green Bay Packers, of their own volition, join in the Lord&rsquo;s
    Prayer before a game. Many good and gentle people have fallen in
    love this night. At this moment, thousands of women are in labor
    with the fruit of a good marriage. Thousands of kids sleep the deep
    sleep that comes after the long practice hours for competitive
    swimming and tennis. Good men have died today, leaving hearts sick
    with loss. In quiet rooms young girls are writing poems. People are
    laughing together, in safe places.</p>
  <p class="western">This spell, which seems to persist for minutes,
    probably subsides in seconds, but it is a deeply mystical moment &ndash;
    such as can be shared only by lovers in a reverent silence
    sanctioned and sealed with a clasp of hands. Just as suddenly, it is
    all over, the veil lifts, and one (especially a military-trained
    individual) reverts to practiced methodology. I discover Kathleen
    has already been somewhat alerted by someone who has called from
    California to get my office phone number. I ask if Charlie is at
    home. He is. I request that he also get on the phone. After all, I&rsquo;m
    not sure how Kathleen might react to he devastating shock of the
    news, so I want someone else present there to know what&rsquo;s
    going on. We really don&rsquo;t say much. We don&rsquo;t know much.
    But we know enough, and there&rsquo;s just not very much to say.
    Charlie is to drive down and pick me up at the office &ndash; then
    at 15th and L Streets in Washington. He&rsquo;s there in 20 minutes.
    I&rsquo;m standing out front, waiting in the rain. It doesn&rsquo;t
    matter. I had to retreat from the small talk of the office. I&rsquo;ve
    done all I can for the moment, and I&rsquo;m back in dreamland. We
    drive home in silence. We both steal sidelong glances at each other.
    I seem to remember a tear or two valiantly straining the corners of
    our eyes despite our best efforts. I&rsquo;m certain we were both
    praying.</p>
  <p class="western">We had last heard from George on 18 Sep, a mere
    15 days ago. He reported that due to a recently announced release of
    reserves there was a &ldquo;hole&rdquo; in VF-111, a fixed-wing
    fighter squadron &ndash; the <i>Sundowners</i>. It was to be filled
    by those F-8 Crusader pilots who had (as he had) just qualified in
    the <i>USS Ranger</i>. They were to begin the following week of 23
    Sep a series of 40 flight hours of practice sessions operating out
    of Miramar. On 18 Nov they were to deploy to Fallon Field, about 50
    miles east of Reno, NV, for one-and-a-half weeks of simulated air
    strikes. Then they were to deploy aboard <i>USS Ticonderoga</i> from
    10 to 20 Dec for refresher qualifications. Finally, he suspected to
    be &ldquo;free&rdquo; from 21 Dec to 1 Jan, before reporting back
    aboard <i>Ticonderoga</i> on 3 Jan 1969 for expected deployment to
    the far Pacific and Viet Nam. As it turned out, he was to be back
    home in Washington at 7:22 pm on 1 Dec &ndash; in Ward T-14 at the
    Naval Hospital, Bethesda, MD.</p>
  <p class="western">How this change in plans came about is part and
    parcel of the F-8 Crusader legend. This was the plane that was to be
    known as the &ldquo;MIG Master.&rdquo; While it didn&rsquo;t shoot
    down the most MIGs, it had by far the best kill rate, prevailing at
    a ratio of 6.3:1, compared to the overall U.S. kill rate of a mere
    2:1! This plane was really something else. The first pilot to put
    1000 hours in type was Congressional Medal of Honor winner Cdr. (now
    VAdm.) James B Stockdale, who spent 7-1/2 years in the Hoa Lo POW
    camp. As a former Landing Signal Officer he avers that the Crusader
    was &ldquo;as demanding an airplane in the groove as any the Navy
    ever put aboard carriers,&rdquo; and maybe &ldquo;the first for
    which pre-selection of pilots on the basis of their reflexes &hellip;
    was advisable.&ldquo;This plane required such a delicate trimming
    touch that the stick was provided with two little right-angled
    potentiometer wheels enabling the ultimate in fine-tuning. One pilot
    described flying the Crusader as &ldquo;the most fun I ever had with
    my clothes on,&rdquo; while another decried that it &ldquo;took a
    mere 10 years to screw it up with an air-to-ground mission.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">It became a popular cry in that fleet that &ldquo;When
    you&rsquo;re out of Crusaders, you&rsquo;re out of fighters.&rdquo;
    There were many, however, who modified this tribute in recognition
    of Crusader&rsquo;s championship accident rate (2&ndash;3 times that
    of the F-4 Phantom; one every 78 hours at sea) to &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re
    out of Crusaders, you&rsquo;re out of trouble.&rdquo; This plane was
    no pussycat. It was a real mean tiger &ndash; the first production
    plane to exceed 1000 mph in level flight, the first shipboard plane
    to exceed Mach 1 (it was rated Mach 1.7 but was often pushed to
    almost Mach 2). Astronaut John Glenn set the cross-country speed
    record in it on 16 Jul 1957 at slightly above Mach 1 (725 mph). It
    took eight bending Gs to permanently deform it, and it could climb
    from brakes off to 40,000 feet in 2-1/2 minutes. She approached at
    170 mph &ndash; the same as the space shuttle! The VF-111 <i>Sundowners</i>
    concluded the MIG-a-month record of the summer of 1968 with its
    Sidewinder (an air-intercept missile of the heat-seeking variety)
    kill of 19 Sep 1968. This was its 160th shootdown, and the <i>last
      Crusader MIG kill</i> &ndash; on the <i>111</i>th mission of VF-<i>111</i>
    from CV-<i>11</i>. Here was a squadron of destiny, one of the few
    with kills in WWII, Korea, and &rsquo;Nam. This Navy fighter had the
    most hours from 1960&ndash;66, and 53% of the total Navy kills from
    1965 to the LBJ bombing shutdown of 1968.</p>
  <p class="western">Our particular story, however, concerns only one
    Crusader, and it really begins on Tuesday, 1 Oct 1968. That is when
    Lt. Hugh J. Risseeuw, USN, the Weapons Training Officer of VF-111,
    conducted a Practice Weapons Delivery &ldquo;brief&rdquo; to all
    squadron members. This session covered (a) pattern altitudes and
    airspeeds; (b) weapons release and firing attitudes, including
    altimeter lag data and a discussion of scan techniques; and (c)
    minimum pull-out altitudes, etc., with special stress and warnings
    on pressing too close, &ldquo;target fixation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;hosing.&rdquo;
    These items were all taken from the F-8 Technical Manual, the
    emphasis being upon 20-mm strafing, Mk76 practice bombing, and the
    dive recovery charts. At the conclusion of this presentation,
    kneeboard cards containing all of the procedures covered were
    provided to each pilot. George was present at this session.</p>
  <p class="western">The pertinent flight schedule for the following
    Thursday, 3 Oct 1968, lists George for two sorties, with take-offs
    at 0700 and 1500. The briefing for his first scheduled flight was
    conducted at 0600 (45 minutes before sunrise) by flight leader
    Lt.(jg) Thomas L. Garrett, USNR. Other members of the flight were
    Lt. Risseeuw, Lt.(jg) Laughter, and George. The expected duration of
    the bomb and strafe exercise was 1-1/2 hours. Only the strafing
    exercise is germane to this story. Roll-in was to commence at 5000
    AGL at 350&ndash;400 KIAS with a 20-degree strafing dive. Firing was
    to commence at 1000 AGL with pull-out at 200&ndash;300 feet &ndash;
    with due diligence for 100&ndash;200-foot altimeter lag. This
    translates into a 500-mph dive actually programmed to terminate only
    90&ndash;100 feet above the ground! That&rsquo;s not too much margin
    for error! This is really sticky stuff.</p>
  <p class="western">More than that, an early-morning flight over the
    6500-foot mountain range between Miramar and El Centro might well
    (as Cdr. Parrish explained to Kathleen and me on our first meeting
    with him later in the squadron hangar at Miramar) be expected to
    entail an additional but unmeasured altimeter error. This
    sandbagging situation was further aggravated in George&rsquo;s case
    by the Target Controller requesting an additional &ldquo;dummy&rdquo;
    pass by George with the result that he would then have only two
    rather than the three customarily allotted passes to &ldquo;shoot
    out.&rdquo; This means that if he was to expend all of his ammo
    (which is desirable so that armorers working in the desert sun know
    that their work has not been in vain), he would really have to
    concentrate on his aiming, thereby having less time to monitor his
    instruments. He would also have to fire longer, which would
    contribute to a lower pull-out. This situation was a real
    psychological set-up, and George subsequently confirmed a desire to
    &ldquo;fire out,&rdquo; initiating his burst at 1500 instead of 1000
    feet. (The investigators concluded that, because of that, altimeter
    lag, and incorrect altimeter setting, and possible failure of the
    pilot to take 100-foot elevation of the target into consideration,
    George was probably some 470 feet lower than he thought and
    compounded this by slightly extending his burst.)</p>
  <p class="western">In any event, take-off proceeded according to
    plan about 0705. George was in Alpha Hotel 107, Bureau Number
    148631, a single-engine, swept-wing jet aircraft which had been
    accepted to the squadron on 18 Sep, the very day of his last call
    home. It was deemed to be in excellent shape by the squadron&rsquo;s
    Assistant Maintenance Officer, Lt. Carl G. Stattin, USNR, a new
    engine having been installed on 19 Aug. The Mark F-5A Ejection Seat
    &ndash; which was to save George&rsquo;s life &ndash; was installed
    on 16 May 1968. At this time George had 477 flight hours and had
    completed the FITRON 124 training syllabus in F-8 type aircraft. He
    had also flown seven precious air-to-ground weapon delivery flights
    in F-8 type aircraft, the last one being flown with FITRON 111 only
    two days earlier on 1 Oct. He was to complete only three more such
    passes.</p>
  <p class="western">On the way to the air-to-ground target complex in
    Restricted Area R-2512, Lt. Garrett passed the lead to Lt. Laughter
    due to a long-range radio deficiency. This placed Lt. Garrett
    directly behind George in the pattern. There were no clouds present
    at pattern altitude or any unusual wind conditions which might
    adversely affect the attack runs. The first run was a &ldquo;dummy&rdquo;
    run as briefed. (George&rsquo;s second pass was also a &ldquo;dummy&rdquo;
    run due to a misalignment on the target.) Glen A. Wellman, ABF3, was
    Petty Officer in Charge at Target 68 and had a three-man crew. Two
    men were left in Rake #1 to spot strafing hits. The other man
    accompanied Wellman to the Butler hut to help with target
    operations. Upon entering the hut Wellman donned a phone to the Rake
    shack in order to relay hits to the radio operator. At this point
    one of the men in Rake #1 mentioned that <i>all of the aircraft were
      low on their pull-ups.</i></p>
  <p class="western">George was &ldquo;right on target&rdquo; with a
    20-mm burst on his third pass. On his fourth pass, his second firing
    pass, George rolled into a 23-degree dive at 5800 feet, squeezed the
    trigger at 1500 feet, and began his pull-out as he passed 1100 feet.
    He remembers pulling some positive G on the aircraft and looking
    left to check interval on his flight leader. Suddenly he realized
    that the desert sagebrush was zooming past the canopy much too fast
    and much too close. Lt. Garrett realized that George was going to
    hit the ground an instant before impact. It must have been at this
    instant that Wellman reports that, before he even had time to notice
    the reported low pull-ups, he hears a pilot on the UHF say, &ldquo;Oh
    my God!&rdquo; He continues, &ldquo;There was a flash of fire and an
    explosion. The aircraft which had just made a hot run had crashed.&rdquo;
    Garrett reports only that &ldquo;by the time I keyed my mike he had
    hit and skidded along the desert floor and exploded. I heard no
    radio transmission from Lt. Wright prior to or after his impact with
    the ground.&rdquo; Significantly, <i>neither Garrett nor Wellman
      reported any evidence of George escaping the plane, despite the
      semi-deployment of his chute.</i></p>
  <p class="western">The aircraft first impacted approximately 535
    feet beyond the strafing target in a flat, wings-level, nose-up
    attitude with a very small rate of descent. It skidded about 200
    feet along the sand &ndash; like a smooth pebble skimming a pond &ndash;
    becoming airborne again while traversing a shallow ravine (another
    miracle &ndash; that ravine!), and then impacted in a totally
    disintegrating explosion some 465 feet farther along the flight
    path. At about a <i>mere 120 feet</i> before the final exploding
    impact of the plane and the ground, George initiated an ejection by
    pulling the face curtain. Right here we confront the very crux of
    George&rsquo;s survival. He had been expecting an 8,262-mile trip
    <i>west</i> to Saigon. In a veritable flash he opted for a
    2,100-mile trip <i>east</i> to Silver Spring. In between he was a
    <i>mere 1-3/4 tenths of a second</i> from a trip to &hellip;
    eternity! The simple cold fact is the ejection gun had propelled the
    seat only 16 inches up the rails before the tubes were bent and
    frozen by the progressing damage. So, George left the cockpit in a
    fairly flat trajectory at a forward speed <i>in excess of 345 miles
      per hour!</i> In effect, George became a human projectile, traveling
    the length of two football fields per second! His drogue chute
    deployed, and his personal parachute was ripped and torn, suggesting
    that he was partially decelerated and pulled from his seat as his
    chute caught in ground vegetation. George struck the ground hard,
    leading with the seat pan and right foot. His right sole was sheared
    back-to-front by either rudder or torn-free engine. The seat pan
    absorbed much of the force which otherwise would have caused major
    spinal injuries. George was found, but not easily, about 900 feet
    beyond the point of the explosion, and the seat was found another
    300 feet along the path of his trajectory. Debris from the initial
    point of aircraft impact was found along a line extending about 4200
    feet to where the engine came to rest. Needless to say, the plane
    was a total loss, and George nearly so. Garrett estimated that the
    crash occurred about 0740, and the Flight Surgeon confirmed that by
    virtue of El Centro monitoring radio traffic between Target 68 and
    Target Operations, it had notice of the crash at 0743. Garrett
    released Risseeuw to Miramar, sent Laughter up to line-of-sight
    radio contact with the NAS, and swung low seeking George, advising
    El Centro of the crash by 0748. However, there was still no word
    concerning George, with both air and ground personnel remaining
    oblivious to any possibility of his survival. How like the
    <i>resurrection</i>! Nobody witnessed that, either &ndash; merely
    the empty tomb!</p>

    Jack&rsquo;s hand-drawn schematic of George&rsquo;s crash<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote60anc" href="#sdendnote60sym"><sup>60</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">Remote rescue operations were initiated at El
    Centro at 0750 with the dispatch of a Flight Surgeon and ambulance.
    This was followed at 0800 by a 6511th Test Group (Parachute) U.S.
    Air Force rescue helicopter launch from El Centro, complete with
    Flight Air Safety Officer and two photographers. This was the unit,
    airborne within 17 minutes of the crash, which was to eventually
    effect George&rsquo;s removal to El Centro. Five miles out of El
    Centro, however, they had a 14-minute letdown to repair an oil leak,
    which triggered the 0808 launch of another helo by the 6511th Test
    Group. Finally, and it wasn&rsquo;t until 0812, approximately <i>32
      minutes after the crash</i>, a report was received that &ldquo;<i>the
      pilot was alive</i> and needed medical attention badly.&rdquo;
    Meanwhile, at 0813 an H-34 rescue helicopter departed the Marine
    Corps Air Station, Yuma, AZ, some 40 miles distant. The El Centro
    Flight Surgeon&rsquo;s helo, finally, after the 14-minute oil leak
    letdown, landed alongside George at 0833. At this point the three
    helicopters and the earlier dispatched ambulance all had each other
    in sight as they converged on the scene. George lay battered but
    fully conscious in a slight breeze in the desert for 53 minutes but
    felt pain only if he tried to sit.</p>
  <p class="western">The helo-borne Flight Surgeon was not, however,
    the first man actually on the spot. That was Apprentice Airman R. F.
    Daniels from the target crew. His arrival and the belated discovery
    of George&rsquo;s miraculous escape is detailed in the post-crash
    report of Petty Officer Wellman:</p>
  <p class="western">I then proceeded to go through crash procedures.
    I left &hellip; with one man and picked up two CO2&rsquo;s &hellip;
    and went to Rake #1 to get another man. We proceeded in the general
    direction of the crash until the truck started to sink in the sand.
    I stopped the truck and we got out the CO2&rsquo;s and started to
    put out the fire&hellip; We left the wing section burning (it was
    too fuel saturated to extinguish) and started over the hill in the
    direction of more fire. After reaching the top of the hill <i>I saw
      the pilot and his chute. I saw the pilot move his head and look our
      way</i>. [Welcome back, Lazarus!]</p>
  <p class="western">We went to his aid to see if we could give him
    any first aid. There was no serious bleeding so I sent one man back
    to make sure medical help was on the way. We talked to the pilot
    until the helo from Yuma [and El Centro] arrived and the doctors
    took over.</p>
  <p class="western">Lt. Garrett had meanwhile remained over the crash
    site until the arrival of the helos. He then diverted to El Centro.
    On arrival there he noted a C-130 Marine Corps Air Evac 689 shooting
    touch-and-go&rsquo;s and had the brilliant presence of mind to
    recommend that the tower land it and hold it to evacuate George to
    Miramar, instead of flying him all the way there by the infinitely
    slower helicopter.</p>
  <p class="western">The Flight Surgeon from El Centro, Lt. (MC) J. J.
    Beck, USNR, who insisted on accompanying George all the way to
    Miramar, found George lying supine with his helmet, torso harness,
    G-suit, and boots still fastened in place. (One can only hope that
    these items helped to stifle bleeding to his ultimate benefit.) The
    doctor reports, &ldquo;His skin was an ashen gray color, his eyes
    were open and staring his mouth was open and his teeth were dry and
    covered with blood, his pulse was barely perceptible. Part of his
    ruptured metal seat pan was wrapped around his right thigh. The sole
    and heel of his right boot were missing. The pilot complained of
    pain in his right ankle, left hip, and left hand. There was evidence
    of only moderate blood loss from his right heel.&rdquo; The seat pan
    and helmet were removed and his torso harness and G-suit were opened
    to release constriction.</p>
  <p class="western">Victim and doctors then departed the scene by
    helo at 0846 &ndash; <i>one hour and six minutes after the crash.</i>
    A single unsuccessful attempt to start intravenous infusion was made
    aboard the helo. Other ministrations are recorded thus: &ldquo;The
    pilot was reassured and was given water on a gauze sponge to moisten
    his mouth.&rdquo; It was also reported that George, who had
    sustained major injuries, &ldquo;<i>very nearly expired en route.</i>&rdquo;
    Following this 17-minute helicopter flight to El Centro, George was
    transferred to the C-130 transport. After a flight of about 20
    minutes to Miramar, he was transferred to an ambulance for the
    14.5-mile, 23-minute dash to Balboa Naval Hospital. There he was
    finally thoroughly examined and given the first genuine medical
    attention. At this point of admission, George was &ldquo;in shock&rdquo;
    and his &ldquo;<i>pulse was not obtainable</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Dr. Beck relates that aboard Marine Evac 689,
    he&rsquo;d asked the pilot about the accident and that this is the
    story that George (who was in shock) related: &ldquo;We had three
    runs on the target. [Actually, of course, it was four runs.] The
    first one was to be a dummy run, and I think I made a second run,
    and I think that was a dummy run too. [It was.] So I had two runs to
    go, I think. [he did.] My third run I think was a strafing run. [It
    was and he was right on target. He then continues to discuss what he
    calls his third run, but he is from here actually discussing his
    fourth and final run.] I started strafing at 1500 feet. [That is
    correct, and he purposely began 500 feet high to enable a longer
    burst, in order, he hoped, to &ldquo;shoot out.&rdquo;] At 1000 feet
    I started pulling back on the stick, but I guess I didn&rsquo;t pull
    back hard enough&hellip; I think I remember an impact. [He probably
    did, and this no doubt prompted a training reflex &ndash; pulling
    the face curtain to initiate the life-saving ejection a bare instant
    before the second and explosive impact!] Then I was dreaming and
    woke up and saw some black smoke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Dr. Beck then specifically asked George if he
    remembered initiating an ejection, and he said he didn&rsquo;t think
    he had but he couldn&rsquo;t remember. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t
    questioned further at this time, and a few minutes later expressed
    some concern that he felt he was going to pass out.&rdquo; [This was
    hardly a time for George to really concentrate on any
    recollections!] He was reassured that it was all right for him to
    close his eyes and to not worry if he did pass out. &ldquo;He had
    been conscious all the time,&rdquo; Dr. Beck reports, &ldquo;from my
    arrival at the scene. his pulse was taken several times aboard Air
    Evac 689 and was generally about 120 and quite weak. He received no
    medication prior to landing at Naval Air Station, Miramar. His eyes
    were closed for only a short time aboard Air Evac 689 and he was
    fully conscious on landing at Naval Air Station, Miramar.&rdquo; And
    so it was George returned to his 0705 take-off point at about
    0926.he then continued on by ambulance to finally arrive at Balboa
    Naval Hospital, in downtown San Diego, at about 0952 &ndash; for his
    first genuine medical attention. This was by now some two hours and
    12 minutes since his near-fatal crash in the desert.</p>
  <p class="western">It was about 1252 Washington time that George
    arrived at the hospital in San Diego. Some two hours and 23 minutes
    later, at 1515 Washington time, his loved ones at home had the news.
    We were assured that he was getting the best possible care, that
    there was no need for us to depart for San Diego, and that we would
    be kept informed. We knew nothing of the miraculous nature of his
    escape, the violence of his accident, or the extreme seriousness of
    his condition. In fact we had no specifics on his condition.
    Actually, this state of affairs nevertheless reflects excellent
    communications. After all, they couldn&rsquo;t have told us much
    more then in any event, because even they didn&rsquo;t know his
    status until completion of approximately six hours of exploratory
    and (largely orthopedic) remedial surgery. Specific immediate
    treatment comprised the intravenous introduction of fluids (glucose
    in the neck) and blood, administration of oxygen (nose-trachea
    tube), comprehensive x-rays (including a dye-injected bladder x-ray
    that proved negative on damage), a skull check-out, and an
    exploratory laparotomy (top-to-bottom slit down chest and belly to
    explore all internal organs, during which a large laceration of the
    liver was closed and accumulated blood was evacuated from the
    stomach cavity). He was also given the Last Rites of the Roman
    Catholic Church by the hospital chaplain, Father Edward Murray. Even
    these minimal details became known to us only much later.</p>
  <p class="western">Meanwhile our home was infected with the eerie
    quiet common to funeral parlor waiting rooms. KT recalls the first
    phone call &ndash; some idiot annoying Kathleen with a request for
    my office phone number. Then the second call &ndash; which she
    didn&rsquo;t know was me &ndash; in which older children present
    were told to get on the phone with Kathleen. It must really be
    something exciting, she thought. Then, after the second call, the
    aforementioned strange, somber quiet descended over the entire
    household like a sudden, chilling, early spring shower. She recalls
    that even Grandma, &ldquo;who really got knocked into action during
    emergencies&rdquo; (like when Mom had to rush to the hospital to
    have a baby) was pale, quiet, and very still. She recalls that
    nobody could look at anybody else when Kathleen said, &ldquo;George
    has been in a bad plane accident and is in the hospital in
    California.&rdquo; That was all! She recalls asking Charlie for
    details and him saying only, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go get Dad,
    but it sure doesn&rsquo;t look good!&rdquo; And he left. Suddenly
    she realized it was all very, very serious.</p>
  <p class="western">KT next remembers when I got home. Kathleen and I
    embraced at the door, cried silently, and said nothing. Later, she
    recalls, I was sitting in the kitchen in a white shirt, with
    slackened tie, flushed face vivid against the white shirt, silently
    sipping bourbon. Then I suddenly jumped up from the table and bolted
    for the door, exclaiming that I was walking to church, and started
    off coatless and hatless through a light misting rain. KT then went
    into the backyard and found Moni sobbing under the overhang. She
    tried to comfort her like &ldquo;Big Sister.&rdquo; Moni became
    enraged, advised her that she could cry if she wanted to, and KT
    felt sort of &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; and went off to cry by herself on
    the kitchen steps. This was interrupted by irreverent one-liners
    from Johnny (until he digested the news) as he eventually showed up,
    as usual, just in time for dinner.</p>
  <p class="western">Church was strange. There was quite a crowd,
    because they happened to be hearing confessions for First Friday,
    the next day. I remember going into Father Hartel&rsquo;s box &ndash;
    real calm, firm, and poised. I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go
    to confession, Father. I would just like to ask for announcements at
    tomorrow&rsquo;s Masses asking for prayers &hellip; for &hellip; my
    &hellip; son&hellip; He&rsquo;s in a hospital &hellip; from a bad
    airplane crash&hellip;&rdquo; I then broke down completely. I was
    totally wasted. I just sobbed like a fool. Father Hartel was merely
    great. I soon left church thoroughly recharged, and then set about
    trying to organize our family efforts, pulling things together, and
    getting on with some sensible plan of how to proceed. The very first
    thing, of course, would be to get the promised further report from
    Cdr. Parrish, who was to follow up with the findings of the hospital
    examination.</p>
  <p class="western">So, we sat down to a dinner that couldn&rsquo;t
    have been more unreal had it taken place on the moon. Every little
    clink of silver on plate sounded like the explosion of a 500-pound
    bomb. Everyone was intent on examining the contents of their plates.
    Nobody could engage anyone else&rsquo;s eyes. Finally the phone
    rang. Every ear then focused on my non-committal, seemingly endless
    series of yes &hellip; yes &hellip; yeses. At last, according to KT,
    I returned to the table with a relieved smile, said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
    the deal!&rdquo; and started reciting a list of injuries from a
    paper on which I&rsquo;d made notes. She recalls that it sounded
    like George had broken every bone in his body, but that all that
    stuck in her mind was &ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; and that after
    I finished, it was sort of like everybody felt kind of like
    applauding. Here is a summary of my notes: Lucky SOB &ndash; should
    be dead &ndash; hit at 500 mph &ndash; got out on his own &ndash;
    just before second bounce &ndash; fantastic &ndash; both heels &ndash;
    right ankle, knee, and tibia &ndash; sipping water and ice &ndash;
    watching right foot &ndash; might have to come off &ndash; but still
    has some circulation &ndash; euphoric &ndash; repeats &lsquo;Fly
    Navy&rsquo; &ndash; no need to come &ndash; will keep in touch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">We had three other calls during dinner that
    evening. One was from Chaplain Murray. I&rsquo;d been able to leave
    a request for him to call earlier that afternoon. I&rsquo;d gotten
    his name and number via my secretary Doris&rsquo;s husband Paul, who
    happened to be an active CPO on duty in Washington. He had also
    gotten me the Balboa Hospital&rsquo;s Duty Officer phone number via
    his official Navy contacts. The chaplain could report only generally
    on George&rsquo;s condition, the fact of the &ldquo;precautionary&rdquo;
    Last Rites, and his hope to be able to give George Holy Communion by
    the following Sunday. The second call was to read a subsequently
    delivered crash-confirming telegram from the squadron commander. The
    third and final call was from the local Red Cross. They advised that
    if I needed money to travel to San Diego that they would make it
    available. I expressed my amazed appreciation, but told them that
    the hospital officials there had advised that such a trip didn&rsquo;t
    seem indicated at the time. All in all we went to bed that night
    somewhat relieved. The thought of any possibility of death no longer
    even entered our minds. Our prayers now were mainly centered on
    continuing circulation to save that right leg and foot.</p>
  <p class="western">As we proceeded into the weekend &ndash; the
    crash occurred on a Thursday morning &ndash; very little additional
    info was forthcoming. Nobody contacted us, so we frantically tried
    every possible angle we could think of to get news of further
    developments, especially regarding the right foot. All gleanings
    were the same: everything was about the same, still some circulation
    in the right foot, no need to come, etc. There was one exception.
    Squadron mate Chuck Scott called late Sunday night and expressed a
    categoric imperative that we, Kathleen and I, should get there as
    soon as possible. It was quite clear to him that George wanted us,
    expected us, and was wondering when we&rsquo;d get there. We then
    immediately began preparations to go as soon as possible. I called
    my boss to get permission to leave. No problem there. I called Red
    Cross to follow up on arranging the offered free transportation.
    Imagine our shock on being told, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, sir.
    That would be out of the question. Such arrangements are possible
    <i>only in case of an actual or imminent death</i>, and then we
    contact you automatically!&rdquo; Well, of course, they had done
    just that &ndash; on Thursday evening &ndash; and the belatedly
    understood implication of that call now sent a damp chill racing
    through our bodies. Damn hospital jargon, anyway! Now we knew what
    &ldquo;condition <i>guarded</i>&rdquo; really meant.</p>
  <p class="western">We were finally able to get a noon flight out of
    Dulles on Tuesday, 8 October. Mrs. Bryce drove Kathleen and me to
    the Silver Spring Sheraton, where we caught an airport limousine.
    Anne, Charlie, and Martha took over our house and family. The only
    thing I remember about the flight out was the then-popular song they
    kept playing over the American Airlines tape system &ndash; <i>By
      the Time I Get to Phoenix</i> &ndash; to which I&rsquo;d invariably
    and silently add, &ldquo;He may be dying.&rdquo; (I still can&rsquo;t
    ever hear that song without getting the creeps, and strangely enough
    we made our only en route stop in Phoenix.) Anyhow, Chuck Scott met
    us about 2030 in the San Diego Airport at Lindbergh Field. He had
    assured us on his Sunday night phone call that he and wife Sally
    could put us up indefinitely in their spare bedroom. It was by then
    too late for a hospital visit, so first Chuck drove us to the
    Miramar BOQ, where we picked up George&rsquo;s VW (with the
    traditionally reluctant/exciting VW brakes) so as to have
    transportation during our stay. Then we followed him, Kathleen at
    the wheel, me checking the routing via our maps, to his house at
    5219 Winthrop Street. There we were further greeted by his wife
    Sally and daughter Catherine. The latter (whom I recall as somewhere
    between 1 and 2 years old) had a hip cast from some corrective
    surgery for a congenital deformity and could scoot all over the
    house by bellying on a sort of early skateboard. These were A-1
    folks indeed!</p>
  <p class="western">Kathleen and I visited George for the first time
    about 1000 on Wednesday, 9 Oct, six days after the accident. He was
    simply delighted to see us. Thanks only to Chuck Scott, we had
    certainly done the right thing at long last, and I really ought to
    digress here for a moment to recount a very vital lesson learned. I
    had always envied only the vocations of priest and doctor. These
    two, alone so I always thought, were the only ones who could really
    do anything meaningful when a human being was really in trouble. All
    the rest of us, I thought, became merely useless bystanders. Not so!
    Nothing &ndash; absolutely nothing! &ndash; is so therapeutically
    valuable and vital as the friendly face and <i>touch</i> of a loved
    one! I&rsquo;ve seen this confirmed many times since, but this is
    where I learned it. Our presence there, even for the mere few
    minutes allowed in an Intensive Care Unit, was a critical element,
    I&rsquo;m confident, in George&rsquo;s survival. We actually saw the
    dynamic spark of love and life suddenly transform his deep, dark,
    suffering eyes as he looked up and recognized us at this first
    visit. He insisted on repeated kisses, on the mouth, and wouldn&rsquo;t
    let go of our hands. It was an unforgettable and tremendously moving
    moment in all of our lives, even though George was pretty much
    whacked on pain-killing drugs most of the time.</p>
  <p class="western">Still, there is no way else to put it, George was
    a shocking sight. Indeed, God <i>does</i> shout to us in our pains.
    (To whom else can we go?) Six tubes for supplying vital fluids or
    providing equally vital drainage seemed to project from every corner
    of his body and stations in between. A rough cross-stitched scar
    extended down the front of his body from the bottom of his sternum
    to below his navel, and the rest of his body was a patch quilt of
    blood stained bandages, except for which he&rsquo;d have been
    utterly naked. His immediate concerns were threefold: (1) a dire
    need for ice chips (bootlegged at intervals by an attentive
    Corpsman, Ron Sellers), (2) a plea that we stay around, and visit
    him as often and as long as permitted, and (3) an anxiety as to
    whether he had in his word &ldquo;coped.&rdquo; He was concerned
    with a burning compulsion to gather every shred of testimony as to
    whether he had performed professionally, as trained, or to use my
    phrase whether he had somehow &ldquo;goofed off.&rdquo; The response
    then, as now even more clearly confirmed by subsequent evidence, was
    and is fully thumbs-up! (He ejected! There simply are no impact or
    otherwise automatic self-ejection features built into the
    Martin-Baker ejection seat, and the very possibility of even an
    accidental impact-initiated ejection is ruled out by the delay
    between initial impact and ejection!)</p>
  <p class="western">Thereafter our days assumed a sort of
    military-like methodicalness. Kathleen and I stayed pretty much
    within the closed confines of our assigned bedroom at the Scotts to
    minimize encroaching on their privacy. Chuck would be gone before
    we&rsquo;d rise, and Sally would be house-working and over-seeing
    Catherine while Kathleen would make us toast and coffee in the
    morning. Then Kathleen and I would be off in the trusty VW for a day
    spent in the hospital environs, from about 0900 to 2100. We were
    allowed a five minute visit in the ICU at 1000&ndash;1400-2000
    daily. To assure against missing a visit, you&rsquo;d be on hand
    20&ndash;30 minutes early, especially as you always hoped to
    intercept a doctor for questioning. We therefore became quite
    familiar with all the other similarly spaced out habitu&eacute;s of
    the ICU waiting room. I especially remember an older lady whose
    husband was terminally sick and who died while we were there; a
    young mother whose baby daughter had some serious congenital
    affliction; and the relatives of a young sailor who had suffered a
    violent Saturday-night motorcycle accident. Such details are
    remarkable here precisely as they underscore how shared pain draws
    suffering humanity together for mutual support. Before our shared
    ordeals were over, we knew all these folks like family. Time spent
    in an ICU waiting room is only somewhat less memorable, I&rsquo;d
    guess, than time spent in the ICU itself.</p>
  <p class="western">As often as not Kathleen and I would grab our
    only food at the hospital staff snack bar in the building
    immediately across the street from the ICU. Apart from the fleeting
    actual moments with George, the highlight of each day became Holy
    Communion at the noon mass in the hospital Chapel. There was never
    any question in our minds that this daily mass was our main
    contribution to George&rsquo;s well-being each day, and we gave it
    everything we had. One especially dramatic aspect of these masses
    was the all-male chorus of lusty young sailors booming out &ldquo;Sons
    of God, Eat His Body, Drink His Blood&rdquo; as they almost marched
    to Communion each day! I can still hear them, and we were certain
    that the Lord was hearing us all.</p>
  <p class="western">Yet another daily highlight was our 1500 phone
    call home each day, to both report on George and to check out how
    things were going in Silver Spring. Here, so far as I can recall,
    let me proclaim the first and long overdue resounding tribute to the
    Silver Spring contingent for making our San Diego stay so worry-free
    from their standpoint! Anne, Charlie, and Martha must truly have
    been outstanding as SOPAs (Senior Official Parents Aboard). Their
    one highlight was the evening Art Feenan, Doris and Sharon showed up
    from my office to cook them a great real steak dinner.</p>
  <p class="western">Kathleen and I enjoyed a few more breaks than
    that in our routine. The hardest time to fill was between our 1500
    call home and the 2000 hospital visit. Usually we&rsquo;d just sit
    reading quietly in the sun on the front hill of the hospital which
    overlooked the city of San Diego &ndash; sort of to the southwest
    and the falling sun. Twice we guiltily snuck off to a movie &ndash;
    <i>The Graduate</i> and Shirley MacLaine&rsquo;s <i>Woman Times
      Seven</i>. (We had to leave early both times.) Once we went to a
    terrific dinner at Squadron mate George Melnyk&rsquo;s home. There
    we met wife Pat and son, George, Jr. George is a sort of a cross
    between Leo Gorcy (of the Dead End Kids) and Barretta &ndash; a
    no-nonsense, tough-talking, cigar-chomping blusterer, but really
    all-around nice guy. Wife Pat made the best spaghetti west of the
    Pugliese tribe, and was a truly fine gal. I remember my telling
    Kathleen then that I wished our George could find a Pat like that,
    not dreaming then that so soon he would (though her specialty is
    lasagna). Then, too, this was the time and place where Kathleen and
    I discovered martinis. (See, George, you drove us to it!) We got in
    the habit of driving down the hill to the Grant Hotel where we could
    sip something in the bar till we made our 1500 phone call. We
    started with our customary bourbon on the rocks, but soon found that
    you only get a thimble this way at a full drink price. So, we soon
    learned to substitute the equally potent but much bigger and
    same-priced martini for the teenie-bopper bourbon.</p>
  <p class="western">There were several unusual aspects of the overall
    proceedings in San Diego. First, Anne and Margie Pflaum had paid a
    recent visit, and George was soon to receive a life-size blowup
    print of a picture Anne took of him standing in front of a small
    mountain of aircraft wrecks at the base airplane dump. That&rsquo;s
    certainly a little bizarre in retrospect. Second, there was a
    general queasiness throughout his squadron over the fact that the
    very evening before the crash George had had several members witness
    his <i>Last Will and Testament</i>. Recalling that brought lumps to
    many throats, I can assure you. Then there is the matter of George&rsquo;s
    survival itself. Without exception, everyone agreed that his
    excellent physical condition &ndash; he had been working out like a
    monk every day &ndash; and the fact of his paratrooper training
    proficiency (he was a 1964 class Honor Graduate) undoubtedly stood
    him in good stead. (George considers it critical to survival that
    this training prompted his searching out a harness so tight that it
    was hard to walk upright, which probably held his seat pan in place
    and his torso together.</p>
  <p class="western">Then there was the fact of the Marine C-130 Air
    Evac and the unrewarded (so far as I know) role that Lt. Garrett
    played in its emergency redeployment. You may recall that Garrett
    reported that the C-130 just happened to be shooting touch-and-go&rsquo;s
    at El Centro on his arrival there from the crash scene. This
    medically equipped plane (George remembers the stenciled inscription
    on the bulkhead at his elbow which read &ldquo;Cadavers must be
    stacked aft of frame XX&rdquo;) also just happened to have a
    cruising speed slightly more than 5 times faster than the replaced
    helicopter. This fact, and Lt. Garrett&rsquo;s insistence on its
    being pressed into service for the rescue transfer, saved at least
    45 minutes on George&rsquo;s mad dash to the hospital, and surely
    everyone is familiar with how critical even seconds became in
    President Reagan&rsquo;s 1981 post-assassination trip to George
    Washington Hospital! And, you may recall, even so George very nearly
    expired en route. So, praise be Lt. Garrett wherever he is!
    Incidentally, the Navy now provides an air rescue facility at El
    Centro during target operations. As for Tom Garrett, we know only
    that he joined the airlines just in time to be furloughed by a pilot
    glut and economy moves. He then worked for a time as a golf course
    greenskeeper, but he is probably ready to be a first officer by now.
    Happy landings, Tom!</p>
  <p class="western">The final bizarre aspect of the San Diego
    experience was that the Balboa Hospital&rsquo;s ICU was on the top
    floor of a hilltop building just 300&ndash;400 feet directly below
    the commercial airline jet pattern in and out of Lindbergh Field.
    Every passing plane created a hellish din and shook the entire
    building. It sounded for all the world like the plane was shooting a
    landing on the roof or was even trying to get in bed with you.
    Needless to say, George didn&rsquo;t find this situation too
    thrilling. At first his whole body would noticeably tense up and a
    somewhat haunted expression would flicker across his eyes as every
    plane passed overhead. Gradually all of this merged into the
    unconsciousness of customary background noise and you grew oblivious
    to it. Funny thing, too, they still had Quiet Zone signs up on the
    surrounding streets. I guess the pilots couldn&rsquo;t read these
    signs from the air. Anyhow, the worst was yet to come.</p>
  <p class="western">We had arrived on the 8th and were due to depart
    on Sunday the 13th, so I could return to work the following Monday.
    We would have by then had a good extended visit with George, and he
    seemed to be progressing satisfactorily, and even circulation in the
    right foot was showing improvement (although I should make clear his
    orthopedic surgeon said from the very first that it wasn&rsquo;t
    going to heal and the sooner it came off the better). We had, at
    last, actually managed to get an interview with one of the doctors
    (who always seemed to be out during visiting hours). The orthopedics
    expert, Dr. DeWaal, gave us his prognosis. (George also had been
    attended by the chest cutter, Dr. Oury, and an internal medicine
    specialist, Dr. Anderson.)</p>
  <p class="western">Dr. DeWaal indicated that George had evidently
    landed somewhat on the right side (as well as seat and heels), and
    that his helmet evidently prevented any serious head or facial
    injury. He emphasized that the right foot had suffered complete
    destruction (fragmentation) and in his opinion wasn&rsquo;t worth
    saving and would impede overall recovery. He categorically
    maintained that it would never again become functional. The left
    foot was fused and would have limited flexibility, and, he said, a
    plate and several metal screws or pins had been used in
    restructuring the left knee. (The removal of these would put George
    back on crutches the following Sep.) The doctor anticipated George
    would have a permanent limp. Still, he felt that all in all things
    were going very well. George should be out of the hospital by the
    end of Dec (though he might not be able to put any weight on his
    right foot for an additional three months), and then he might very
    well be permitted to relocate to DC at his own expense. Further,
    he&rsquo;d be allowed to exercise the left knee as soon as the
    kidneys stabilized.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, before the kidneys were to stabilize George
    went into complete renal failure. His temperature suddenly soared,
    and a radical skin rash reaction to some medication infected his
    entire body. He became a wild-eyed instant raging mess. He literally
    went out of his mind and had to be totally restrained by huge
    leather straps lest he rip out his intravenous feeders and drains.
    One time his eyes riveted on my left hand. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a Naval Academy ring! Did you graduate
    from there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Damn,&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;So did I!&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t even recognize me or
    Kathleen. We had simply returned for the customary late evening
    visit one day after a completely normal afternoon visit and there it
    was: Jekyll had become Hyde!</p>
  <p class="western">The shock was incredible. You simply cannot
    imagine how it is to behold your own beloved flesh and blood in a
    stark raving fit of delirium! (I&rsquo;m reminded in retrospect of
    some of the more gross episodes from the Exorcist.) It is totally
    frightening! How tenuous is the thread of our sanity! Moreover, you
    don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s to be any coming back! (The
    official report merely states regarding all this that &ldquo;the
    patient&rsquo;s post-operative course was <i>stormy</i>&rdquo;!)
    Things became stormy indeed, and this put an entirely new complexion
    on the whole situation. Only that morning we had told the Scotts
    we&rsquo;d be leaving Sunday, but we happened to encounter Chuck on
    the hospital parking lot that evening and told him of the startling
    change in things. We apologized and asked it we might, after all,
    extend our visit. Of course we could. He couldn&rsquo;t understand
    our hurry in the first place, we were no trouble, we could stay as
    long as we liked. They were glad to be able to help. Talk about
    friends&hellip;</p>
  <p class="western">Yes, we did indeed find many friends. Starting
    with Mrs. Bryce, then the Scotts, then my boss, and finally my old
    shipmate Ace Foster from the <i>USS Amsterdam</i>. As for my boss,
    Kathleen and I arrived at Lindbergh Field more than an hour early
    for our homeward flight. We had no sooner gotten all checked in than
    I was paged on the airport phone which then told me to call my
    office in Washington collect. I did, and my boss said if I could get
    out to the Naval Electronics Laboratory on Point Loma, and sign in
    and out there before my flight departure, then he could and would
    issue a set of travel orders which might fully reimburse me for my
    emergency trip expenses. The round trip to NEL from Lindbergh Field
    is almost 14 miles, and I had already checked in for the flight.
    Nevertheless, Kathleen and I <i>flew</i> out there in a wild
    record-breaking taxi dash, and then just made it up the ramp for
    last call at Lindbergh Field. My orders to <i>check the progress on
      ADPESO Project 004-67</i> provided reimbursement for $460. Our plane
    tickets totaled $430.50, with our rent being free. Friends!</p>
  <p class="western">As for Ace, he and his wife, Bernice, had been
    the ones who had some 20 years before met Kathleen and George at the
    airport in California when I had to unexpectedly chaperon the
    Sentimental Journey of <i>USS Amsterdam</i> from Long Beach Naval
    Shipyard to Pearl Harbor for our over-Christmas overhaul. The entire
    ship&rsquo;s company had relocated their families from the east to
    west coast for the holidays, and we had barely put half of the
    officers and crew (including Ace, then my Assistant) on leave before
    the rest of us had to execute the change of orders for an overhaul
    in Pearl instead of in the States. Anyhow, Kathleen and I had driven
    through Escondido on the 1500&ndash;2000 break one day and I
    remembered that Ace had always said that was where he was going to
    retire. So we stopped and looked them up in the phone book. They
    were listed all right, but in Chula Vista, which is on the opposite
    side of San Diego. So, we just had time to later drop them a line
    about George&rsquo;s condition and whereabouts. Good old Ace
    thereafter made several extended visits to George, long after we had
    returned to DC, and he faithfully phoned us on his condition.
    Friends! Kathleen and I paid them a happy reunion and thank-you
    visit over lunch in Borrego Springs, CA, on the San Diego-Tucson leg
    of our 1979 cross-country auto trip.</p>
  <p class="western">Now, to return to our story, just as suddenly as
    George went into the shock of renal failure, his condition reversed
    once again just as dramatically a couple of days later, such that we
    were able to leave San Diego on Thursday, 17 Oct, just two weeks
    after the accident. George came off the critical list the following
    Monday, 21 Oct. He was back in Washington on 1 Dec, at the Bethesda
    Naval Hospital Center and <i>not</i> at his own expense. I was idly
    thumbing through the OSD phone book one day for something, and I
    suddenly got the idea of looking for some Bureau of Medicine and
    Surgery office to contact about the possibility of patient
    relocation by the Navy. I soon stumbled upon an entry labeled
    Patient&rsquo;s Family Affairs Liaison or some such. I simply called
    the listed Commander and asked him why George couldn&rsquo;t be
    transferred for convalescence where we could visit him. He said he&rsquo;d
    look into it and I never heard from him again. Instead, I got a
    good-humoredly threatening call from Balboa questioning why I didn&rsquo;t
    like their service, asking why I was raising so much hell in
    Washington, and concluding with, &ldquo;Your son will be arriving in
    Bethesda on 1 Dec via Scott AFB, Illinois.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">But our little phone book roulette is not the
    whole story on this. KT remembers walking alone in the backyard
    after dinner and wishing on the stars, wishing George could come
    home. Not more than 5 minutes later, she swears (and, of course, you
    have to allow for the speed of light reaching the stars), Kathleen
    called her to tell her about the phone call saying George was coming
    home. Who are you going to believe?</p>
  <p class="western">You will recall that George had been scheduled
    for Jan 1969 deployment to offshore Viet Nam operations &ndash;
    so-called Yankee Station Special Operations. After operational
    readiness exercises in the second week of Jan (during which one A-7
    Corsair pilot was lost at sea), the <i>USS Ticonderog</i>a (CV14) in
    fact departed San Diego on 1 Feb 1969, the first CV to make five
    such deployments. She then made stops in Pearl Harbor; Yokosuka,
    Japan; and Subic Bay, RPI. The first potential combat deployment
    then followed on 4&ndash;19 Mar, with Lt.(jg) B.G. Hahn of VF-111
    making the 123,000th arrested landing aboard Ticonderoga on 18 Mar
    1969. Following a week&rsquo;s respite, the second combat deployment
    occurred 30 Mar&ndash;16 Apr. Then followed 10 days of contingency
    operations in the Sea of Japan occasioned by a North Korean
    aircraft&rsquo;s shoot-down of a U.S. Navy EC-121 reconnaissance
    aircraft [which Charlie notes was from VQ-1, the same squadron that
    he would join on Guam in late 1972]. During the latter period our
    dear friend and benefactor, Lt. Tom Garrett executed the 125,000th
    arrested landing aboard Ticonderoga. Another respite in Subic Bay
    followed, during which Ticonderoga celebrated her 25th anniversary,
    marking her as the oldest attack aircraft carrier on active service.</p>
  <p class="western">Two more Yankee Station deployments followed on
    10 May&ndash;4 Jun, and 26 Jun&ndash;1 Aug, with the latter 37-day
    exercise being the longest deployment on station during that cruise.
    An R&amp;R visit to exotic Hong Kong intervened between these two
    deployments, which also included two successful F-8 ejections,
    successful A-4 and A-7 ejections, and the loss of an A-4 pilot who
    flew into the sea on launch of a combat strike. This, plus the loss
    of the Air Wing Commander, Cdr. Charles Cates, in his A-7 on
    Okinawa, testify to the dangers attending such deployments even
    apart from combat itself. VF-111 flew off Ticonderoga for extended
    stateside R&amp;R in San Diego on 17 Sep, thus completing a
    relatively uneventful 254-day cruise embracing 97 days on Yankee
    Station. During the cruise Ticonderoga was visited on 22 May by then
    VAdm. Bill Bringle, a former and junior head of department shipmate
    of mine in <i>USS Bremerton</i>, who was then Commander 7th Fleet;
    and on 2&ndash;3 Jul by RAdm. Dan Gallery, then researching material
    for a new book.</p>
  <p class="western">But George was not meant to be a part of all
    this. Instead, he returned to Washington on 1 Dec 1968. After the
    failure of a skin graft from his right thigh to close a
    bone-exposing suppurating wound in his right heel, George&rsquo;s
    right leg was amputated just below the knee on 13 Feb 1969. (No! it
    was not a Friday the Thirteenth, merely a Thursday.) The pins were
    removed from his left knee in Sep 1969. But in between these two
    events in Feb and Sep George experienced yet another accident.</p>
  <p class="western">He had this date with a Navy nurse. He escorted
    Lt.(jg) Pat Brady on 30 Mar to see and hear <i>Judy Collins in
      Concert</i> at Constitution Hall. A proposal soon followed,
    coincident with a visit to the MacArthur theatre for <i>The Lion in
      Winter</i>. Finally, George slipped a ring on Pat&rsquo;s finger in
    the Bethesda Chapel on 28 May 1969. The current prognosis for this
    happy accident is still highly favorable despite the interim traumas
    of Bob, Mike, Matt, and Phil. All of this therefore doesn&rsquo;t
    say so much about near death as it does about life. All life is a
    re-enactment of the paradox which St. Paul terms &ldquo;the folly of
    the cross.&rdquo; You cannot have hills without valleys, birth
    without labor, happiness without pain, a resurrection without a
    crucifixion. Indeed, God draws closest to us when we hurt. Pain <i>is</i>
    His megaphone! So, remember, the rainbow always follows the storm,
    and even though Graham Greene is right when he says &ldquo;Suffering
    is always something which will be provided when it is required,&rdquo;
    accept it as the herald of the Good News! God guarantees
    keepers-of-the-faith a happy ending!</p>
  <p class="western">It now remains only to give George&rsquo;s
    maternal Grandpa his customary last word written only two days after
    George&rsquo;s accident:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">How George survived instant death in such a
    terrible crash is a miracle. Only a few months hence he would likely
    have been flying a jet plane off a Navy aircraft carrier and over
    Viet Nam. Who can say he might not have been shot down without a
    trace? This will mean a radical change in George&rsquo;s career. He
    faces a major re-adjustment in his life, a real crisis. Even after
    recovery the resulting physical disability will most likely mean his
    separation from the Navy. (And in mid-Jun 1969 he was indeed found
    unfit for further military service.) He will need to be comforted
    and consoled and given the benefit of the fervent prayers of many
    folks. Helping him to bear this great cross manfully and generously
    will mean that what God has permitted to be taken away, He will
    replace with something better, heaped up and overflowing.</p>
  <p class="western">AMEN! How often my own father (and now my own
    experience) has verified this fundamental Christian truth: Unless
    the grain of wheat falls to earth and dies, it remains just a grain
    of wheat. But if it does die, it produces much fruit. And, so we say
    again, AMEN! And here&rsquo;s to George&rsquo;s #1 Nurse, and to Lt.
    Garrett, and to the Scotts, wherever they may be!</p>
  <p class="western">As for Grandpa Kirk, with a wife and six
    daughters in the home he never really had the last word, and so we
    can&rsquo;t let him get away with it here. Let&rsquo;s let George
    have the last word on this key event in his life. His comments amply
    testify to the fulfillment of Grandpa&rsquo;s expressed hope that he
    might bear his cross manfully and generously, thus:</p>
  <p class="western">It&rsquo;s not really a great cross. En route
    from Balboa to Bethesda, I had to stay a few nights in the Scott AFB
    temporary dispensary, a waiting room for the non-ambulatory awaiting
    flights to various points in CONUS. Here <i>were</i> people with
    <i>great</i> crosses: 18-year-olds, no education, no arms, no legs
    (or maybe just paralyzed arms and legs), no eyes, and one suspects
    not very much hope for the future, either. (This is to say nothing
    of burn cases too sick to transport.) These are the folks that need
    comfort and consolation. I think about these people when I hear
    about the veterans on hunger strike for more investigation of agent
    orange and delayed stress syndrome. What a crock! That&rsquo;s what
    comes of turning minor inconveniences into great crosses!</p>
  <p class="western">Right on, George!</p>

    greatness to the ability of detecting in those they destine for
    their tools the exact quality that matters for their work.<span style="font-style: normal">
	&ndash;&nbsp;Joseph&nbsp;Conrad</span></p>
  <p class="western">I left home for good on 10 Aug 1936. I was almost
    eighteen-and-a-half years old. I hadn&rsquo;t the slightest idea
    what lay ahead. I only knew that I had a life objective and that my
    journey had begun. I had no fear and no regrets. It was all to be a
    great adventure. So, I set out for the Naval Academy, my father
    driving me to Annapolis, just as I was to drive our son, George,
    some 26 years later.</p>
  <p class="western">So, where are we? Actually, we jumped a little
    ahead in our continuity in order to present George&rsquo;s desert
    saga all in one piece. That episode spanned the period of the Oct
    crash to his May engagement, but a lot more was going on in the wild
    and woolly last half of 1968. You may remember that on 4 Jun RFK was
    shot. He died, thank God &ndash; his wounds were mentally terminal
    the next day. The national spirit was really sagging now. Comes good
    Pope Paul to the rescue, zapping one and all with a solid-lead
    life-preserver: <i>Humanae Vitae</i>. This was just about the time
    some luckily nameless fool coined the soon-to-be clich&eacute;:
    &ldquo;Have a nice day!&rdquo; Well, the same to you, fella! But
    what, really, would be our present verdict on <i>Humanae Vitae</i>?
    Good question&rdquo; hard to answer. In situations of this kind
    we&rsquo;ve always found it prudent to revert to certain basic
    principles, which we have found in our experience to be reliable.
    Thus: (1) It is generally wise not to accept as <i>definitive</i> in
    a <i>Pilgrim</i> Church any single trend of ecclesiastical tradition
    or theology; (2) Life holds many mysteries to which there are no
    <i>final</i> answers in this world &ndash; &ldquo;How deep are the
    riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How inscrutable his
    judgments, how unsearchable his ways&rdquo;; (3) Cultivate a healthy
    skepticism of anyone who would presume to <i>know</i> &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
    design&rdquo; in any matter not clearly revealed through the gospels
    wherein we alone meet Christ &ndash; for &ldquo;Who has known the
    mind of the Lord?&rdquo; &ndash; no member of the hierarchy has a
    monopoly on a hot-line to the Holy Spirit, and, when all is said and
    done the private, personal (<i>informed!</i>) conscience remains
    inviolable.</p>
  <p class="western">We should elaborate that final point before going
    further. Human inquiry is unwise which would ignore the cumulative
    scholarship of specialists and the continuum of collective
    historical experience. In the realm of moral theology, the Church is
    uniquely qualified as a depository of ever-evolving wisdom. It would
    be foolhardy for each individual to undertake the re-invention of
    the wheel by sheer dint of his or her own meager education and
    expertise in the face of each and every moral dilemma. At the same
    time, too many promoters of responsible parenthood seemingly forget
    to whom it is that they are ultimately responsible. It behooves us
    to be familiar with the distilled but still crystallizing
    conclusions of mankind with respect to all important questions.
    However, it would be ridiculous to eschew such guidance on the
    grounds, for example, that &ldquo;professional unmarrieds&rdquo; can
    or should have anything to teach &ldquo;marrieds&rdquo; about
    marriage. After all, an expert medical diagnostician doesn&rsquo;t
    have to have suffered every disease in the book in order to write a
    prescription for a cure. All of this, of course, is just a long way
    around of saying: proceed with caution, don&rsquo;t think you know
    it all.</p>
  <p class="western">Now we can finally get on with it. The real &ldquo;nub&rdquo;
    of <i>Humanae Vitae</i> comes in section 11, thus: &ldquo;Each and
    every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life.&rdquo;
    (It might be well to note that it is not the adoption of the
    products and techniques wrought by science but the distortion of the
    significance of a human act which is deemed contrary to the personal
    moral nature of humankind. At the same time, there can clearly be no
    contravention nor abrogation of such moral nature involved where a
    couple chooses the healthy self-discipline of abstention from
    intercourse during periods of probable fruitfulness.) Well, at least
    there is no ambiguity in proposition 11, no equivocation. It&rsquo;s
    quite clear enough. Really? Think again! What, <i>precisely</i>,
    constitutes the transmission of <i>uniquely human</i> life? There is
    a purely biological aspect, to be sure. But the <i>human</i> entity,
    per se, compels the infusion of a soul. Surely we wouldn&rsquo;t
    contend that the latter is transmitted with the seed. It seems
    equally clear that a soul can&rsquo;t, in fact, be infused until a
    new biological entity exists, no matter how embryonic it might be.
    Hence, transmission of seed, and its effective matriculation with
    the ovum must have occurred <i>prior</i> to infusion of the soul. It
    therefore follows, it seems to me, that any materially &ldquo;sterilizing&rdquo;
    intervention which precludes the aforesaid matriculation can be said
    <i>prima facie</i> to reflect an action antecedent to any potential
    materialization of a new <i>human</i> being. (This line of
    reasoning, it also seems to me, even more so obscures any definitive
    determination of whether the ingestion of some substance &ndash;
    say, a pill hours before intercourse &ndash; would constitute an
    &ldquo;intervention.&rdquo;) I could go on, but I think you get my
    point: Indeed, God&rsquo;s ways <i>are</i> mysterious, we can&rsquo;t
    really <i>know</i>, and ultimately we can only rely on our best
    conscience. What is <i>our</i> conscience in the matter, you might
    well ask. Well, it&rsquo;s academic now, of course, but we never had
    any problems with section eleven.</p>
  <p class="western">&ldquo;Good grief!&rdquo; (I can almost hear the
    exclamations.) &ldquo;What a digression!&rdquo; No, not really. This
    entire exercise has been an attempt to show you (and <i>me</i>!) how
    I became whatever it is that I am, and what it is that I represent
    and most firmly believe and hold sacred and dear. I would hope that
    the foregoing might be a representative indication. It now remains
    only to remark on three peripheral points before proceeding. First,
    you may be amazed (as I was) to note that <i>Humanae Vitae</i>&rsquo;s
    opening and closing salutations address &ldquo;Venerable <i>brothers</i>
    and beloved <i>sons&rdquo;</i>! This seems strange indeed, for a
    subject so intimately involving <i>women</i>. Second, I&rsquo;m
    always put off somewhat by ecclesiastical documents which are not
    derived in large measure from the gospels. As I&rsquo;ve noted, that
    is the <i>only</i> place we meet Jesus. It turns out that Christ is
    mentioned only twice in <i>Humanae Vitae</i>. In fact the gospels
    number only seven out of a total of 41 citations.</p>
  <p class="western">Jesus, of course, didn&rsquo;t have anything to
    say about birth control. Hold it! To those of you who might cry out
    &ldquo;IUD&rsquo;s hadn&rsquo;t been invented yet!&rdquo; let me
    just note JC also had nothing to say about homosexuals, and the
    Bible is otherwise replete with references to them. Third, I&rsquo;m
    frequently taken aback by the too-often half-baked non-sequiturs
    crammed into encyclicals in the clear expectation that shear weight
    may serve to substantiate relatively questionable propositions.
    There are several instances of such speciousness when <i>Humanae
      Vitae</i> goes on to elaborate additional problems with artificial
    birth-control, such as the potential for: increasing marital
    infidelity, lowering standards of morality, easy corruption of
    youth, and loss of respect for women. One should learn to quit when
    they&rsquo;re ahead, and so I too had best quit right now!</p>
  <p class="western">What else was happening in the latter half of
    1968? Well, it was estimated that 89 million Americans watched the
    Chicago police on TV as they clubbed protesters at the late summer
    Democratic convention. (&ldquo;Have a nice day!&rdquo;) In August
    Warsaw pact armor crushed a Czech uprising, while American youth
    staged its own uprising at fabled Woodstock. Jackie announced plans
    to marry Ari. (There&rsquo;s a thrill and a half.) On 14 Sep our
    children presented us with a freezer for our 25th wedding
    anniversary, but the opulent Jackie-Ari wedding almost immediately
    upstaged us. Walter Schirra took our first Apollo capsule into
    space, even as our entire family spaced out over &ldquo;<i>that</i>
    phone call&rdquo; from Miramar &ndash; the news of George&rsquo;s
    near-fatal and totally unplanned desert plowing expedition. As you
    already know, we were to spend 8 to 17 Oct in San Diego visiting his
    bedside. Suffice it to say, neither George nor we were having &ldquo;a
    nice day&rdquo; very often then, but we did have a great one when he
    came off the critical list on 21 Oct and even more so when he
    returned to the area (Bethesda Hospital) on l Dec 1968. Tricky had
    been elected on 4 Nov, and Noel McCormick still remembers his
    delight when I said on hearing the news, &rdquo;There goes the
    country!&rdquo; and proceeded appropriately if inadvertently to turn
    off the TV when I hurled a pillow at it in frustration.</p>
  <p class="western">At about this time Kathleen was taking her
    frustrations out in a Piper 140. In Jun we had shifted from
    Montgomery Airpark and its Cessnas to Friendship (now
    Baltimore-Washington International) and its Pipers. This gave us the
    advantage and practice of operating in and out of a control tower
    airport, a slightly faster plane, and a better rental rate. In
    short, it was &ldquo;an offer we couldn&rsquo;t refuse.&rdquo; So it
    was that she flew us to Skybryce in the nearby Virginia mountains to
    have lunch at the ski lodge there. Well, the 1,262-foot airport
    elevation proved to be a little startling to us sea-level pilots.
    Kathleen proceeded to have to perform two go-arounds as she came in
    too hot the first two passes. She was really thrilled at lunch when
    the waiter asked her if she&rsquo;d seen &ldquo;that crazy fool
    dive-bombing the runway in that blue Piper.&rdquo; (Hold that tip!)</p>
  <p class="western">Still, we were making progress. I passed 100
    hours on 22 Oct 68, and Kathleen logged her first 100 hours on 20
    Jan 69. In any event, we finally closed out this most eventful year
    as Borman read from the opening lines of Genesis as he circled the
    moon in Apollo 8 on Christmas Eve, and Anne was figuratively flying
    to the moon only a few days later as she and Doug were wed on 28 Dec
    1968. I&rsquo;ll never forget the heart-warming sight of all of our
    beautiful little daughters dressed in green velvet, and the low-key
    yet fancy family reception at the nearby Stonehouse Inn, and the
    joyous presence of newly-home George even though he was in a
    wheelchair. Sadly, both the Inn and the marriage are now &ldquo;gone
    with the wind,&rdquo; but George happily keeps imitating <i>Old Man
      River.</i></p>
  <p class="western">So, we usher in 1969, the close of what perhaps
    was in many ways the most turbulent decade in all our lives. And for
    Johnny, it wasn&rsquo;t over yet. On 1 Jan Joe Namath&rsquo;s Jets
    upset his beloved Colts 16-7, and he was devastated. So came John
    Wayne with the prescription: <i>True Grit</i>. People were singing
    <i>What the World Needs Now is Love, Sweet Love</i>, Simon and
    Garfunkel were pushing <i>The Sounds of Silence</i>, and youngsters
    were parroting &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trust anyone over 30!&rdquo; (You
    wonder what those youngsters now well over 30 are parroting today!)
    Other &ldquo;in&rdquo; phrases were: &ldquo;Make love, not war!&rdquo;
    &ldquo;God is on a trip!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sorry about that!&rdquo;
    Woody Allen contributed, &ldquo;Not only is God dead, but have you
    ever tried to get a plumber on Sunday?&rdquo; The book of the year
    was <i>Portnoy&rsquo;s Complaint</i>. Clearly, the sixties were
    going out &ldquo;on a roll.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Not so, George. On 13 Feb he said goodbye to his
    right leg below the knee. By 28 Apr DeGaulle was &ldquo;out&rdquo;
    in France and the U.S. had its &ldquo;tops&rdquo; of 543,400 men in
    Viet Nam. By 18 Jul Teddy Kennedy had taken his
    never-to-be-forgotten swim at Chappaquiddick, and on the 20th (a
    Sunday) Neil Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the
    moon at precisely 2226 EDT. Now, does anyone remember who the <i>second</i>
    person on the moon was, or who was the <i>last</i>? Of course not!
    Well, the answers are Buzz Aldrin and Gene Cernan. The first landing
    was from Apollo 11, the last (the 6th, in Dec 1972) was from Apollo
    17. Now, nobody can say they didn&rsquo;t learn something in reading
    this book!</p>
  <p class="western">A major delight of the new year of 1969 was a
    surprise invitation from my Uncle El and Aunt Agnes for an
    &ldquo;all-expenses&rdquo; visit to Ormond Beach. It was essentially
    a relief mission for Kathleen and I from the trauma of George&rsquo;s
    recent accident and the constant pressure of my mother&rsquo;s
    demanding presence. This was sorely needed, and no surprise has ever
    come at a more timely moment. These &ldquo;fairy god-parents&rdquo;
    provided pre-paid flight arrangements, met us at and delivered us to
    the airport in Florida, and in between provided rent-free
    ocean-front motel accommodations which were within walking distance
    of their apartment but yet afforded us much-needed private time
    alone together. Not only that, they provided continuous
    entertainment throughout our week-long visit: a car ride up
    unbelievably wide and flat Daytona Beach (original site of the still
    famous Daytona auto races); a side trip to Sea World (or was it
    Marineland?); a trip to the shrimp boat dock for the purchase of
    fresh-caught shrimp for a fabulous cocktail-hour canap&eacute;;
    several dinners out at fancy restaurants and country clubs &ndash;
    the whole works! They incidentally introduced us to the practice of
    a daily bourbon allotment of two miniatures apiece &ndash; a really
    cute touch at their age. A fine time was had by all (for which we
    still remain so grateful), and this was the cementing of a really
    warm family relationship that continues to this day via my monthly
    letter to my surviving but now invalided Aunt. Uncle El died of
    heart failure (!) in 1974.</p>
  <p class="western">Time just <i>flew</i> by in 1969. Yes, folks,
    Kathleen and I once again took to the air with a vengeance. In May
    we shifted our base of operations from Friendship (now BWI) to
    Dulles (IAD). Whereas we had left Montgomery for Baltimore to get a
    cheaper rental rate, we shifted from BWI to IAD to get a slightly
    bigger and faster plane, the 4-seater Cessna 172 in lieu of a 2-
    seat Piper 140. We also got a much nicer airport &ndash; perhaps the
    best in the world. It is so big we were once instructed to land on a
    taxiway (to keep the runways clear). One of the big events of this
    period was our 16 Jul foray aloft with George and Pat as passengers.
    Aside from his trip back to D.C., I think this may well have been
    George&rsquo;s first venture aloft since his Oct &lsquo;68 crash.</p>

    Kathleen approaching Dulles runway 1R for touch-and-go, April 13,
    1968</h3>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">We flew out of
    Dulles to Montgomery and thence to College Park, the oldest airport
    in the United States. My log shows that I performed three no-flap
    landings, one 20-degree-flap landing, and two full-flap (40-degree)
    landings. Kathleen executed one go-around (too high) and two
    full-flap landings. It&rsquo;s a wonder Pat didn&rsquo;t get sick.
    It <i>is</i> true that she never asked for a second flight. We spent
    one-and-a-half hours aloft, and little College Park with 4
    passengers on a hot July day was really pushing our little airplane.
    We must have looked like Lindbergh&rsquo;s take-off for Paris as we
    just cleared the phone and power lines that bordered the ends of the
    College Park runways.</p>

    Kathleen and the Author as seen by George and JJ enroute to Harper&rsquo;s
    Ferry &ndash; December 02, 1967</h3>
  <p class="western">We had a similarly extended flying adventure with
    Charlie on 31 Jul. We circled from Dulles to Front Royal, to Sky
    Bryce, to Orange County Airport, to Dulles. We had quite a time
    threading our way through the mountains beneath low clouds on the
    Sky Bryce to Orange County leg, and then had a little turbulence en
    route Orange County to Dulles. Charlie didn&rsquo;t feel too good on
    that last leg, but it was probably mostly our fault. We never did
    get too accomplished at keeping the little ball centered for smooth
    flight &ndash; still &ldquo;practicing Dutch rolls.&rdquo; Kathleen
    and I followed this jaunt up with a quick flying trip to Ocean City
    where Gary and Martha were then spending a few days. Then in
    October, we took one of our bigger ventures, a trip to Northampton,
    Mass., to visit Anne and Doug. Anne picked us up at La Fleur
    airport, and that night she and Doug took us into town for a
    fabulous atmosphere dinner in an old-style cellar restaurant. I
    still remember the smell of apples that permeated the stairwell to
    Anne and Doug&rsquo;s cute little upstairs apartment. KT and Mo also
    visited this cozy little place in the summer of 69. Judging by a
    letter from KT, a fine time was had by all. They visited a flea
    market, a leather factory outlet, and <i>the world&rsquo;s largest
      basket store</i>. That fall KT skied-out upon being accepted for
    Regina High School&rsquo;s cheerleading team, and Anne embarked on a
    course in <i>American Radicalism and the New Left</i> at the
    University of Massachusetts. To each his own.</p>
  <p class="western">Two other major events occurred that summer of
    1969. On 20 Jul George accompanied me on a flight from Montgomery
    Airpark to Frederick airport where I wanted to practice landings.
    Once there, I executed four no-flap, power-off landings. This is an
    exercise to improve your proficiency at getting down safely if your
    engine should quit on you. (Of course it helps not be over a city or
    a forest, and it&rsquo;s even better if you just happen to be almost
    on top of an airfield. Still, it&rsquo;s a lot of fun. Well, George
    is in the right seat through all this, and at the end of my 4th
    landing he suddenly spoke up: &ldquo;Do you mind if I try a
    landing?&rdquo; Well &hellip;, &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo; And so he
    did, and the contrast couldn&rsquo;t have been more stark from
    power-off glides to power drag-ins and slap-downs that would have
    done any carrier pilot proud. I was sort of proud, too, to be
    privileged to witness George recapturing his wings!</p>
  <p class="western">The other big deal of the summer of 1969 was our
    first big family venture to Ocean City. Does anyone remember our 3
    rooms at the Shoreham Hotel at 9th and the Boardwalk? The boys had a
    room on the north side, as did the girls, while Kathleen and I had
    an ocean-front room, complete with private balcony. Individual
    spending money (intended for meals and recreation, spent at their
    discretion) was parceled out daily before evening meals. It was
    their responsibility to manage it so as to be able to get breakfast
    and lunch the next day as well. Also, when we went out for meals,
    Kathleen and I always had our own separate table, and the children
    had theirs. After all, we were on vacation, too. The boys and the
    two oldest girls alternated days being in charge of the four little
    girls. I mean we were organized. I think perhaps this was one of the
    happiest times ever away from home. It certainly was as a relatively
    &ldquo;young&rdquo; family. Everyone contributed magnificently.</p>
  <p class="western">Meanwhile, George kept pretty busy, too. In Sep
    he had the pins removed from the knee of his left leg. Then, over
    the 15th of Nov we all ventured by several autos all the way to
    Boston for his wedding. We had several rooms in the Holiday Inn in
    Somerville, and held our wedding party rehearsal dinner there the
    night before the wedding. Several of George&rsquo;s squadron buddies
    flew in from Miramar for the festivities &ndash; Chuck Scott, George
    Melnyk, and Steve Risseeuw. They all slept on the floor in one of
    our rooms, but when I tried to pay for them the girl at the desk
    (who had already made up the bill) said it would be too much trouble
    &ndash; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just forget it!&rdquo; Hey! No strain.</p>

    A night with the Bradys &ndash; Howard Johnson&rsquo;s Wheaton motel
    &ndash; October 1969</h3>
  <p class="western">It was there and then we also learned that what I
    thought was the drinking vs. flying rule of &ldquo;24 <i>hours</i>
    from bottle to throttle&rdquo; really was &ldquo;24 <i>steps</i>
    from bottle to throttle&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m only kidding, of course!).
    Anyhow, a great time was had by all. The weather was a perfect early
    fall day; the food, drink, and camaraderie were outstanding,
    concluding with a &ldquo;night-cap&rdquo; party for Kathleen and I
    with other family friends at the Brady house the night of the
    wedding. A police officer friend of Bob Brady&rsquo;s insisted (for
    some reason) on driving Kathleen and I back to our Holiday Inn. All
    in all, everything worked out perfectly. Charlie drove our car back
    to Silver Spring, and kept turning off the dash light so I couldn&rsquo;t
    monitor his speed. John recounted how they had helped Mr. Brady lug
    in liquor, because his back had &ldquo;started to hurt.&rdquo;
    Fortunately for the mood of that great day, we then didn&rsquo;t
    realize this presaged his passing away a mere two months later on 16
    Jan 1970. May he rest in peace!</p>
  <p class="western">So, now we&rsquo;re into the decade of the
    seventies, the decade that was to give us Amtrak, rampant inflation,
    Watergate, Senator Erwin, Peter Rodino, Skylab, the Yom Kippur
    &ldquo;October War,&rdquo; and the resignations of Vice President
    Agnew and President Nixon, the energy crisis, Gerald Ford (&ldquo;If
    Lincoln were alive today, he&rsquo;d be spinning in his grave!&rdquo;),
    Nixon&rsquo;s pardon, and finally Jimmy Carter. Nixon would go to
    China. Big deal! Kathleen and I would go to Taipei, Tokyo, Hong
    Kong, Manila, and Guam. The country would start <i>hearing</i> from
    the so-called &ldquo;Silent Majority.&rdquo; A neat trick, that.</p>
  <p class="western">Janis Joplin would die in 1970, and Vince
    Lombardi, and Charles de Gaulle, and Abdul Nasser. Kathleen and I
    would greet our first grandchild, Robert Joseph Wright. George Allen
    would come to the Redskins and proclaim, &ldquo;The future is now!&rdquo;
    We would try the Shoreham in Ocean City one more time, and Chicago
    would feature the trial of the famous &ldquo;seven.&rdquo; The movie
    of the year would be <i>Patton</i>, but everybody would be humming
    <i>Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head</i> from <i>Butch Cassidy and
      the Sundance Kid</i>. (Was all this so long ago!?!) Yes! John
    graduated from Good Counsel high school, and Mary turned sweet
    sixteen. Our children already ranged from 11 to 26, and Herbie would
    have been 9 that spring. On the 4th of May four students died at
    Kent State, and the country was really in trouble.</p>
  <p class="western">Also in May of 1970 John finally broke the
    15-foot barrier in the pole vault, and Kathleen broke into print
    with an article in the magazine <i>Air Facts</i>. It was an account
    of how she got into flying and her impressions of it entitled: Fly a
    Little &ndash; Live a Lot! (Kathleen really had a way with words.)
    Funny thing! I could never get anything on the subject of aviation
    published under my own name, but here was this article of mine under
    Kathleen&rsquo;s name, and later I published an account of George&rsquo;s
    first solo under his name in <i>Private Pilot</i>. Kathleen&rsquo;s
    little gem was a six-pager, and I can&rsquo;t remember whether she
    even shared the check with me or not. Still, you deserve to share in
    her (our?) experience:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">You&rsquo;re alone in the sky! There&rsquo;s
    nothing else in the world like it. And today almost anyone can fly.
    I think I&rsquo;ve proved that. I don&rsquo;t own a college degree.
    Physics and I are complete strangers. And I&rsquo;ll never be
    confused with a well-trained athlete. As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;ll
    never see fifty again, and ten children have called me &ldquo;Mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Like most mothers, I guess, I&rsquo;ve
    always been a bundle of worry, fearful for my children&rsquo;s
    safety. You may imagine my chagrin therefore, when my oldest son
    began flight training. And, of course, he just had to be a jet
    fighter pilot! Now, flying (in itself) might be safe enough. I was
    sure it was. But flying for the Navy, on and off those bounding
    little aircraft carriers, out there where there&rsquo;s nothing but
    water in all directions, and perhaps even over Viet Nam? Well!</p>
  <p class="quote-western">In any event, my son&rsquo;s letters home
    soon looked like secret messages written in code. I mean, they were
    full of mysterious letters, numbers, and symbols which were utterly
    meaningless to me. They might as well have been written in a foreign
    language, except that one impression came through loud and clear. He
    was having the time of his life! The evident thrill of it all was
    unmistakable. I simply had to find out what it was all about.</p>
  <p class="western">And so she did. On 17 May Thor Heyerdahl set out
    in a papyrus barge, Ra II, from Morocco to a landfall in Barbados on
    12 Jul, thereby proving the feasibility of such a voyage in ancient
    times. That was just about the time Kathleen and I set out on one of
    our more ambitious flights, from Dulles for a week&rsquo;s stay in
    Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. &ldquo;We left on the 9th of May, but
    returned early on the 12th when faced with threatening weather
    forecasts presaging an end to the visual flight rules (VFR) forays
    to which our talents were limited. As a matter of fact, we landed at
    Dulles and caught one of those imported British double-decker buses
    serving the nearby Marriott (where we proposed to spend the
    remainder of our planned week away) when a sudden and vicious
    thunderstorm hit us while still en route to the motel. As Maxwell
    Smart might have said, &ldquo;Mis s s ed us, by tha a a t much!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, as far as we were concerned, our little
    adventure ranked right up there with Thor Heyerdahl&rsquo;s. We
    didn&rsquo;t know it then, but Kathleen was to make her last flight
    on 9 Oct 1970. Before too long we would be grounded as a twosome
    when my heart medicine (yes, folks, way back in early 1971, 10 years
    <i>before</i> my operation) precluded my passing the requisite FAA
    flight physical. (Actually I passed the test, but my affirmative
    answer to a routine question re medication since my last examination
    ended my career as an eagle.) Anyhow, Kathleen got in 3 good
    landings at Montgomery Airpark and then executed a smooth radar
    vector approach and landing at Dulles. Well, it was all great fun
    while it lasted.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">By now you might
    wonder if I did any work at all during the year 1970. Indeed I did.
    As the title proclaims, this was the period in which I claim to have
    become recognized as a professional. What is a professional? It is
    the one person in the office to whom everyone else in the office has
    at one crisis time or another said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and ask
    so-and-so!&rdquo; In short, the professional is the one who knows
    where to find <i>all</i> the answers. The professional need not <i>know</i>
    every answer personally, but the professional always knows where to
    look for them. The professional rises to any and all occasions,
    knows how to handle all kinds of situations, is the one to whom
    everybody turns in an emergency. It is a thankless task, though.
    Really! And there is no so-called upward mobility. It&rsquo;s a dead
    end. Such a person ends up as a jack of all trades and master of
    none. Once having risen to this seemingly lofty status, I had
    nowhere to go but down.</p>

    Skyline drive &ndash; September 1970</h3>
  <p class="western">Two other characteristics of professionals are
    worth remarking. One is that the professional has a secret weapon,
    in a sense. The professional has few truly personal burdens because
    it is a mark of the professional to have the responsibility and the
    talent to pick the proper <i>tools</i>. I always relished being able
    to pick my own helpers. (As I was transferred about, I re-hired both
    Hunter Jones and Bob Jeske twice. You could assign them a task and
    then plain forget it.)</p>
  <p class="western">It might be instructive to pursue this. It was my
    experience that subject-matter specialists were not necessarily or
    even often the best helpers. This is true because, unless you are
    dealing with a material product, the main work objective is to get
    something done by <i>others</i>! This usually means that the essence
    of office work is <i>to communicate</i>! Hence I always placed the
    highest premium on an ability to express one&rsquo;s self, both
    orally and in writing. Damn few people can write a creditable
    letter, and good letter-writers are the office manager&rsquo;s most
    basic need.</p>
  <p class="western">Second to an ability to communicate, I place
    <i>initiative</i>. I never wanted to be surrounded with people who
    constantly waited around to be pushed. I wanted to feel the work
    would always go ahead whether I was there to call the signals or
    not. Finally, I sought <i>dependability</i> &ndash; people I knew I
    could count on, who would be there whenever they were needed. Of
    course, it goes without saying that I wanted honest people. The
    devious worker is about as welcome as a shark in a trout pond.
    Still, the first thing I would seek in my staff was the ability to
    communicate. It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference how much a person
    knows, how brilliant they are, if they can&rsquo;t communicate their
    wisdom.</p>
  <p class="western">The final characteristic of the professional, as
    I see it, is less easy to define. It comprises elements of
    cooperation, congeniality, adaptability, patience, and good humor.
    It also involves a disposition not to take one&rsquo;s self too
    seriously, but to always take others seriously. It entails listening
    a lot, and never offending another&rsquo;s sense of dignity.
    Overall, it&rsquo;s an attitude or disposition that creates a
    climate which &ldquo;makes things work,&rdquo; keeps people speaking
    to each other, and is generally conducive to maximizing each
    contributor&rsquo;s personal satisfaction as everyone works together
    to get the job done.</p>
  <p class="western">This is not a frequently encountered quality, and
    is difficult to sustain. Cultivating and maintaining such an office
    demeanor is damn difficult. It can wear you out. Perhaps the best
    way I can convey the notion of what I&rsquo;m talking about is to
    repeat what I&rsquo;ve always considered one of the highest
    compliments any boss ever paid me. A top-level IBM exec who had
    worked with virtually everybody in my office but me on one project
    or another once asked my boss, &ldquo;But, Jack, what does <i>he</i>
    do?&rdquo; My boss simply replied, &ldquo;Oh, Jack? Well, he&rsquo;s
    the <i>glue</i> that holds the whole thing together.&rdquo; This, I
    feel, is the mark of a true professional. Was I really professional?
    Hey! You don&rsquo;t have to take my word for it. The following is a
    verbatim 30 Sep 1970 letter from the <i>Secretary of the Navy</i> to
    the Director of our office, the Automatic Data Processing Equipment
    Selection office:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Please convey my personal gratitude for an
    outstanding job performed by the personnel of your Office while
    serving on my staff from Jun 1967 to Oct 1970. They have
    consistently met the cumulative objectives for which the Office was
    established. This has been possible through each individual&rsquo;s
    excellent performance of duty, technical competence, personal
    dedication, and sacrifice.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The outstanding contributions of your
    Office as the single, central ADPE selection and acquisition
    activity serving the entire Department can hardly be overemphasized.
    Your people can be proud of the fact that their long and tedious
    hours of operations did not go unnoticed, as evidenced by the many
    commendatory comments received from the Office of Management and
    Budget, General Services Administration, Chief of Naval Operations,
    Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the ADPE industry.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">ADPESO&rsquo;s excellent demonstration of
    <i>professionalism</i> coupled with the enthusiastic and cooperative
    spirit displayed by your office during the past three years has been
    a credit to the Department of the Navy and to the country. I take
    pleasure in commending you and your employees for their personal
    contribution in making their assignment on the Secretarial staff
    such a rewarding and highly successful endeavor. <i>WELL DONE!</i></p>
  <p class="western">Well, you might say, but that&rsquo;s addressed
    to your entire office. True. So, now you must read the personal
    endorsement my boss added to my copy of the above, thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I am convinced that much of our success
    noted in the SecNav letter accrues to the team spirit that prevails
    in the office. This I am sure, is due in some degree to apparently
    mundane but really important personal considerations such as office
    quarters and their arrangement (and ours are the envy of all
    visitors), personnel training and promotion opportunities (and our
    turnover has been minimal), and smooth-flowing supporting services
    (and few offices enjoy such harmonious relationships in this area).
    In addition, I recognize the role <i>you</i> have played within the
    office in format and finalization of internal directives and in
    multiplicity of documents, the quality of which contribute toward
    the enviable image projected by our office. Beyond that, I am keenly
    aware of the unique continuity of experience you bring to the office
    in the realm of our ADP Program policy directives, as through your
    editorship of the <i>Graybook</i>, <i>Greenbook</i>, and <i>Bluebook</i>,
    which were models in the field. I am therefore most pleased to add
    my personal &ldquo;WELL DONE!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Could 1971 top 1970? Time would tell&hellip; This
    would be the year of <i>The French Connection</i> and the conviction
    of Charles Manson. The seeding of the seabed with nukes <i>beyond
      the 12- mile coastal limit</i> would be outlawed by international
    treaty. (Remember Bikini test <i>Baker</i>!?!) The 25th amendment
    would give 18-year-olds the vote. In March Lt. Calley would be
    convicted of killing 22 civilians at My Lai. June would witness the
    publication of the Pentagon Papers. (How did General Maxwell
    Taylor&rsquo;s reputation survive?) In September, 28 convicts would
    die at Attica. In Oct Red China would finally gain admission to the
    U.N. We would acquire our first Nova from Lustine in Feb and our
    first and only Pinto in Dec. Also on the home front, Charlie would
    graduate from Maryland in Feb, and we celebrated with a
    combo-Wright-Haber family dinner at the Royal Palm Restaurant in
    Prince George&rsquo;s Plaza. Martha, who would turn 21 in Jul was
    married on 30 Nov in the BVM Chapel at St. Bernadette&rsquo;s with a
    nifty &ldquo;reception to follow&rdquo; at Kinross Avenue. KT turned
    sweet sixteen in Aug, and Moni graduated from grade school that
    summer. Also that would be the summer we would duck around Mr.
    Steinmetz at Ocean City. Lots of living was going on.</p>

    <i>Blue and Gold, </i>Baron and Spouse &ndash; Pre-flight at Ocean
    City, MD</h3>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">On 22 Mar 1971 I
    took my final flight before being permanently grounded by the FAA.
    This time it was a familiarization flight out of Tipton AFB at Fort
    Meade where I had just joined their Aero Club. In the course of our
    brief four-year flying career, Kathleen and I acquired 272 hours of
    flying time (split just about evenly between us), landed at 29
    airports (including the big-3 locals of DCA, BWI, and IAD), got
    every one of our kids into the air (though Anne opted for George as
    her pilot), and flew as far north and east as Northampton, Mass.,
    and as far west as Sky Bryce, and as far south as Myrtle Beach. It
    was a great experience, but not without its stupidities.</p>
  <p class="western">We did multiple go-arounds trying to set down at
    Sky Bryce&rsquo;s higher elevation, raised a query from the Dulles
    tower as to whether we were all right after bouncing down the runway
    there<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote61anc" href="#sdendnote61sym"><sup>61</sup></a>,
    almost flipped over when our wheels struck the snow bank at the
    plowed end of the Frederick runway, illegally got above solid cloud
    cover over BWI en route from Montgomery to Ocean City, and raised a
    plea from the Harrisburg tower to set down on &ldquo;any runway you
    want, just get it down&rdquo; (after missing the assigned runway),
    landed downwind at Easton, and into on-coming traffic at Orange
    County, VA. Oh well, we were insured and our wills were made out,
    but we sure were lucky. The doctors ruled we were too unhealthy to
    fly, but we&rsquo;d concede that flying was too unhealthy for us. We
    really enjoyed it while it lasted, though. Meanwhile, proving the
    old axiom that another springs up to replace the one that goes down,
    Charlie had left in Jul for Pensacola. He was the second of our sons
    whom we had delivered up to Uncle Sam. This time, instead of going
    to Annapolis, we simply took Charlie to DCA</p>

  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">I must confess
    that such events were always heartrending ones for me. I&rsquo;ve
    always loathed goodbyes right up to and including the boarding of
    Jesse and Laurie at BWI the summer of 1984 following our wonderful
    togetherness at Ocean City. At least we never had to see John off to
    the service, but Mary made up for that. Hell! I guess we ought to
    count our blessings that we&rsquo;ve so far not lost one in battle.
    Many of our contemporaries have. So, thanks be to God.</p>

    Illegal IFR flight<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote62anc" href="#sdendnote62sym"><sup>62</sup></a></h3>
  <p class="western">Still, the goodbyes were tough enough for me. I
    remember I gave Charlie a copy of a letter appropriate to such
    occasions, even as I was later to give a copy to Mary when her turn
    came. It was written by a judge to his son on the latter&rsquo;s
    departing Concord for the Civil War on 15 Dec 1862, but it is
    timeless. For those of you who never experienced the surrender of
    your freedom in the service of our beloved country, I include it
    here. Why? I think it expresses some noble sentiments. So, here&rsquo;s
    to our home-departing soldiers, sailors, and air-persons:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I did not have the opportunity I had hoped
    to talk with you last evening, and therefore take this opportunity
    to give you a few last words of affectionate counsel from home.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">One of your first duties as a soldier will
    be to take all the care you can of your health. The firmer that it
    is, the better you will be able to do any service or undergo any
    fatigue required of you. To preserve you health, you must try to
    lead as regular and temperate a life as possible. I hope you will
    not try to avoid your full share of labor or danger of exposure
    where either is necessary or called for. Take every proper occasion
    for bathing your whole body and scrupulously regard your personal
    cleanliness, no matter how much trouble it may give you. Have
    nothing to do with spiritous liquors of any kind. Take your food
    regularly as you can get it, and neither eat immoderately nor go a
    long time without food, if you can avoid it. Especially be careful
    not to eat in excess after long fasting. I hope you will never
    disgrace yourself by any profanity or obscenity, and will avoid all
    conversations and companions where they are practiced or allowed.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Try to preserve a cheerful and contented
    spirit and encourage it in others. Bear hardships without grumbling
    and always try to do more, rather than less, than your duty. You
    will have occasion to be patient much oftener than to be brave. The
    duty of a soldier is unquestioning obedience, but, beyond this, I
    hope you will cultivate a kind, respectful and considerate temper
    toward your enlisted personnel.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I hope you are going with a love for your
    country and your cause, and with determination to be faithful to
    every duty to be undertaken. My child, you bear the name of one who,
    to the end of his honored life, never shrunk from a duty, however
    painful, nor from a danger to which duty called him. Be sure that
    you do no discredit to it! Neither by cowardice, by falsehood, by
    impurities, by levity nor by selfishness.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Remember always your home and your friends
    &ndash; those who will welcome your return with pride and joy if you
    shall come back in virtue and honor; who will cherish your memory
    if, faithful and true, you have given up your life, but to whom your
    disgrace would cause a pang sharper than death. Remember your
    obligations to duty and to God. And may these thoughts keep you from
    temptation and encourage and strengthen you in danger or sickness.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">And now, my dear child, I commend you to
    God and to the power of His grace. May God bless and keep you. Think
    of your Heavenly Father in health and in sickness, in joy and in
    sorrow. Go to Him for strength and guidance. You are very dear to
    our hearts and your absence leaves a great place vacant in our home.
    If it be according to His will, may you come back to us in safety
    and honor, but whatever is before us, may His mercy and love be ever
    with you and His grace be sufficient for you. With deep affection,
    s/Father.</p>
  <p class="western">In addition to Martha&rsquo;s wedding, the other
    big event of 1971 was Charlie&rsquo;s commissioning at Pensacola.
    Kathleen and I, George, Pat and Bobby went down. Our reserved
    independent motel&rsquo;s air-conditioning was down, so we relocated
    to what turned out to be a much nicer Rodeway chain motel. Pat and
    George attended a special dinner celebration with Charlie the night
    before commissioning while Kathleen and I babysat, enjoying martinis
    and club sandwiches in our room.</p>
  <p class="western">The ceremonies the following day constitute one
    glorious memory. Charlie was one of 27 commissioned that day, and a
    proudly uniformed George got to present him with his commission and
    pin on his Ensign bars. Charlie&rsquo;s graduation from TraRon 10
    followed in Jan. Not only was Charlie one of 4 honor men, he was <i>the</i>
    honor man! He was also designated &ldquo;Outstanding Flight
    Student.&rdquo; <i>WELL DONE</i>, Charlie!</p>
  <p class="western">But even with all this, you haven&rsquo;t heard
    the most amazing thing about this happening: for once the Wrights
    didn&rsquo;t end the listing of participants! Two guys whose names
    began with &ldquo;Z&rdquo; came after Charlie: Zavaglia and Zutkis.
    Thanks, fellows! But then came the problem of orders. Charlie was
    planning to be married (on 18 Mar 72 as it turned out), but this
    little deal had to be integrated with his presence in DC and he was
    still awaiting orders. It turns out that &ldquo;some friend&rdquo;
    in Washington applied so much phone pressure in DC that Charlie was
    the sole person in his group to receive any orders throughout the
    entire month following graduation. Of course the orders turned out
    to be for Guam (where&rsquo;s Guam?) rather than for the expected
    exotica of Rota, Spain. With friends like Charlie had in DC (I shall
    remain nameless), who needs enemies?</p>

    Charlie&rsquo;s commissioning &ndash; October 01, 1971</h3>
  <p class="western">Even as Charlie was proving to be so
    &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo; in Florida, I was receiving another
    outstanding performance rating back in old DC. These accolades,
    which entailed a substantial &ldquo;step&rdquo; pay-raise, were
    predicated on successfully performing at an outstanding level from 3
    different aspects: quantity, quality, and adaptability. I shall only
    inject one item representative of each of these 3 categories at this
    point:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Exceptional performance is reflected in the
    completely revised arrangement and initial drafting of, and the
    correlating and assimilating departmental component comments thereon
    (through four revisions), of the soon-to-be-issued SECNAVINST
    l0462.13A, which exceeds 100 pages. This highly complex
    quasi-technical/quasi-legal document integrates and codifies all
    presently prevailing policy pronouncements from extra-Navy ADPE
    authorities (OSD, GSA and OMB) re the department-wide ADPE
    evaluation/selection/acquisition.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Budget operations have consistently been
    conducted in a manner exceeding normal requirements. First of all,
    the justification and backup provided with original budget
    submissions is of such quality that the initial reviewing authority
    has thus far never had to request additional information nor reduce
    the initial level of the funds requested. Further, this period was
    characterized by a smooth conversion from a staff to a field-office
    status, with substantially different budget submission and
    accounting forms, policies, and procedures, which were additionally
    complicated by split-year funding under the two systems.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Completed the preparation of (and then
    immediately had to thoroughly revise) an office operating manual
    exceeding 150 pages, and comprising more than 50 appendices, to
    translate the full gamut of standard working procedures to the new
    field-office operating environment.</p>
  <p class="western">You may have noted that we have already edged
    well into 1972. This was to be another big family year. Charlie was
    married at St. John&rsquo;s Church on New Hampshire Avenue, and we
    all then celebrated at an expansive reception at the Bethesda
    Officers&rsquo; Club. Great Day! Martha graduated from college, but
    skipped the graduation exercise. Mary turned 18, but thanks to her
    knack for skipping grades she had already graduated from high school
    at 17. I remember her evening graduation exercise at the National
    Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, a clear but sultry summer
    night.</p>
  <p class="western">Meanwhile, Mike was being born on Martha&rsquo;s
    birthday. But even as people were being born in our family, many
    world figures were dying. This was the year Harry Truman died, and
    the Duke of Windsor &ndash; a real <i>doer</i> and a real
    <i>do-nothing</i>! We were also rid at last of J. Edgar Hoover.</p>
  <p class="western"><i>The Godfather</i> was holding forth on the
    silver screen, a guy named Toth (no relative, thank God!) defaced
    the Pieta, and Clifford Irving defaced himself over the Howard
    Hughes biography fraud. The Senate sent ERA to the states for
    ratification. Nixon went to China. Unfortunately, he came back.
    Kathleen and I took a weekend trip to the Eastern Shore, and I came
    back a changed man &ndash; literally! I was coming up on age 55 now,
    and was beginning to look forward to retirement in 1973. Our visit
    to the Eastern Shore was actually to scout out a possible retirement
    home in Talbot (Easton area) County. It was over the second weekend
    following Easter, and that Sunday we attended mass in Easton, and
    the young preacher &ndash; one of those really good preachers you
    meet so rarely in life &ndash; preached on the psalm (#16): &ldquo;Oh
    Lord, You will show me the path of life!&rdquo; And, indeed, <i>He
      did</i>! This event marks not merely the end of this chapter, it
    signaled a radical change in my life &ndash; the end of an era. Read
    on!</p>

      XIX. GROWTH</h2>
  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western">The secret of life and development
    is &hellip; to fall in with the forces at work to do every moment&rsquo;s
    duty aright.<span style="font-style: normal"> &ndash;&nbsp;George&nbsp;MacDonald</span></p>
  <p class="western">My &ldquo;Damascus experience&rdquo; occurred at
    Mass on a Sunday morning in Easton, MD, on 16 Apr 1962. Unlike Paul,
    rather than being blinded, my eyes were opened. As I approached
    retirement, I was increasingly wondering what I would do to continue
    to feel useful once I terminated formal employment. That morning
    lightning struck. I had a sudden sense that anything and everything
    I&rsquo;d done so far was mere prologue, that my most important work
    might yet lie ahead of me. Now I knew what I must do. As I saw it,
    heretofore I&rsquo;d pretty much just been in business for myself
    and our family. I had been tightly focused on earning a living and
    raising our children. Henceforth I would focus on working for others
    &ndash; the less fortunate.</p>
  <p class="western">Now, there are people who seemingly can pursue
    both courses simultaneously, but I&rsquo;d certainly never be
    confused with these heroic figures. I could admire them, but I could
    never emulate them. I could never concentrate on more than one thing
    at a time, with any reasonable hope for success. More often than
    not, one thing at a time would prove to be too much for me to
    handle. In all events, I felt I was now at a point in our lives
    where I could safely afford to redirect my efforts and reorder my
    priorities. In fact, I sensed a very definite <i>call</i> to do just
    that. So it was that I investigated, applied for, and was accepted
    into the Archdiocesan Permanent Deacon Program.</p>
  <p class="western">I moved with my customary dispatch and
    thoroughness. My records show that I completed my first reading of
    the Bishops&rsquo; Committee publication, <i>Permanent Deacons in
      the U.S. Guidelines on Their Formation and Ministry</i>, on 21 Apr
    1972. This, you will note, was a mere <i>five</i> days after I first
    experienced the call. Clearly I was moving right along. Actually,
    this program was both comprehensive and complex, and my problem at
    this point will be to refrain from recounting more about the office
    of deacon than you would ever want to know. I shall endeavor,
    therefore, to deal only with those aspects of the program which most
    specifically impacted me. Beyond that, a word of caution is in order
    at the outset: I am probably not a fair judge of the objectives or
    worth of the permanent diaconate.</p>
  <p class="western">While I personally profited from my participation
    in the program enormously, I never did actually become a deacon, and
    in fact I came to believe that as presently conceived and
    implemented in the U.S. it is about as useful as a fifth wheel. So,
    you would be well advised to discount somewhat any negative comments
    anent this program. My disaffection arose basically from three
    considerations: (1) I came to believe that I had not received a <i>call</i>
    after all (due to an accumulation of worrisome personal insights,
    such as my seeming failure within my own family at that time, <i>i.e.</i>,
    Mary&rsquo;s situation); (2) I became frustrated at the lack of an
    underlying theology for validly substantiating the modern
    (post&ndash;Vatican II) reinstatement of the office; and (3) I
    intuitively balked at a <i>permanent</i> commitment to the
    Archbishop.</p>
  <p class="western">You should know that the most vital qualification
    for becoming a permanent deacon is that one received a <i>call</i>
    from God. Christ is, as St. John has said, &ldquo;The true light
    that enlightens all men,&rdquo; but when it comes to Holy Orders
    (which embrace bishops, priests and deacons), Christ said, &ldquo;It
    was not you who chose me, it was I who chose you.&rdquo; This is
    what is meant by <i>call</i>, and such is certainly what I felt I
    had heard that Apr Sunday of 1972 in Easton, MD. Now, we can&rsquo;t
    be sure, but it is fairly commonly thought that the institution of
    the diaconate may well have occurred as recounted in Acts of the
    Apostles when the twelve soon found that they needed help. Thereupon
    they reportedly said to the assembled community, &ldquo;It is not
    right for us to neglect the Word of God, in order to wait on
    tables.&rdquo; So seven men were designated for that task. So it is
    that <i>service</i> is the essence of the deacon&rsquo;s task.</p>
  <p class="western">The word comes from the Greek, <i>dyackonos</i>;
    that is, servant &ndash; especially one who serves at tables.
    Whether this particular figure is merely symbolic, there can be no
    doubt that the essential surviving function of the deacon is to
    respond to the more-or-less non-sacramental needs of the community,
    and thereby free the priest to concentrate on preaching and
    administering the sacraments, especially hearing confessions and
    confecting the Holy Eucharist. That community service is the proper
    function of the deacon is confirmed by the historical fact that the
    initial decline of the office was precipitated by an absorption with
    administering Church property (in lieu of serving community needs),
    and preoccupation with liturgy (duplicating priestly functions, as
    it were).</p>
  <p class="western">Now it is important that you understand that the
    immediately foregoing personal stipulations as to the proper
    diaconal mission is a clearer statement of the theology of the
    diaconate than I was ever favored to hear or read. What does it
    mean? Essentially it means that the deacon&rsquo;s work is formally
    (in the name of the Church) to perform the corporal and spiritual
    works of mercy: feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe
    the naked, visit the imprisoned, shelter the homeless, visit the
    sick, bury the dead; and admonish the sinner, instruct the ignorant,
    counsel the doubtful, comfort the sorrowful, bear wrongs patiently,
    forgive all injuries, and pray for the living and the dead. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
    you might exclaim, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the proper business of
    all Christians?&rdquo; Of course it is, but this is the deacon&rsquo;s
    paramount function and number-one duty, and he does it as a ordained
    minister of the Church, which brings to bear the special grace,
    charisms, and power with which Holy Orders reinforce one. This, it
    then seemed to me, would be a super way of expending my diminishing
    energies in my declining years in retirement. I therefore embraced
    the program with my traditional all-out gusto.</p>
  <p class="western">First, I became a weekly volunteer to the
    University Nursing Home where I showed movies (from the County
    library system) every Friday for ambulatory patients for the next
    eleven years &ndash; being cited in 1978 as the Maryland Hospital
    Association&rsquo;s <i>Volunteer of the Year</i>. Next (after I had
    actually retired) I additionally became a one-day-a-week volunteer
    assistant to County Probation officers, in which I made out
    court-required reports, tracked down nonpayers of child support and
    alimony, visited homes of parolees to assure compliance to terms of
    parole, etc. Next, I became a one-day-a-week trainee for the role of
    both district and circuit court parole officer. This interesting
    billet required attendance at court as assigned by the district
    attorney, and then (when appropriate) conducting pre-sentencing
    investigations of convicted defendants, explaining the terms of
    parole to them (and the guardians or parents of minors). This was a
    fascinating experience. Additionally, I became an <i>ex officio</i>
    member of the St. Bernadette&rsquo;s parish council, where I
    monitored (and on request gave opinions re) all matters and issues
    under discussion. I also became a regular lector.</p>
  <p class="western">All the foregoing was in addition to attending
    two-hour training sessions two nights a week and one full Saturday
    per month at the old Josephite Seminary at 13th and Varnum streets
    in Washington, diagonally situated from the home in which I was
    raised from age 6 to 17. Finally, I became the administrator of Fr.
    Burke&rsquo;s <i>Word of God Institute</i>, which in time became
    such an all-consuming effort that I one-by-one had to suspend all
    the aforementioned efforts except the Nursing Home business. I was
    totally absorbed in one effort or another 8-to-12 hours a day, seven
    days a week. I was busier than when I had been a full-time
    government employee. The parole and probation efforts, and in a
    somewhat different way the Nursing Home effort, all proved one thing
    to me. There are a hell of lot of people around us every day who
    really are hurting &ndash; and we remain largely oblivious to them.</p>
  <p class="western">I would hope that the foregoing recital provides
    ample testimony of the powerful thrust of the Permanent Deacon
    Program as a factor in what I consider a major transformation in my
    life. After all, heretofore I was almost a &ldquo;professional&rdquo;
    nonparticipant, a totally self-centered loner. Suddenly, I&rsquo;m
    out every evening and throughout every weekend, working in the
    service of my fellow man in one way of another. Moreover, I didn&rsquo;t
    have to be pushed. I was completely swept up in the whole program.
    Nor was I an &ldquo;average&rdquo; participant in the program.
    Despite my being in what might be considered the &ldquo;freshman&rdquo;
    class, it was I who volunteered and single-handedly conceived,
    designed and developed the script and all the slides for a
    recruitment presentation anent the program in our Archdiocese. I
    determined upon and then took all the pictures required for slides,
    had them developed, and then mounted them all at personal expense,
    for which I never received promised reimbursement. (Priests operate
    that way.) My original script was reviewed by the priest-staff
    conducting the program and left virtually unchanged. I even cued in
    and provided musical fanfare intro, accompaniment, and a smash coda.
    The presentation was an outstanding success, and may (as far as I
    know) still be in use.</p>
  <p class="western">In similar fashion, when I learned that the late
    Monsignor Corbett (then at St. Gabriel&rsquo;s) was fingered by the
    Archbishop to be in charge of the planned periodic Archbishop&rsquo;s
    review of all his parishes, I visited him to volunteer to assemble
    all the individual reports, summarize each one, and collate
    strengths and weaknesses, etc., to be presented to the Archbishop
    for action and for dissemination to all clergy for their guidance. I
    was so assigned. I then designed several statistical forms and a
    master summary chart and provided Monsignor Corbett with regular
    weekly summary reports: one for the Archbishop, one for
    dissemination to all clergy. (This is what might be called
    &ldquo;leap-frogging&rdquo; to the very top. It seems I really <i>did</i>
    like to take charge. And, speaking of &ldquo;charge,&rdquo; contrary
    to promises this effort also entailed unrecompensed expenses!)</p>
  <p class="western">In this manner I learned the big picture about
    the entire diocese better than anybody in the diocese &ndash;
    including even Msgr. Corbett or the Archbishop &ndash; since they
    personally received only what I chose to summarize for them. My
    master summary chart provided a fascinating and comprehensive
    analysis of diocesan management and mismanagement. I kept it for
    years, being reluctant to toss out such a treasure trove of inside
    information, but I finally did trash it. One amusing aside in this
    experience was my summary sheet regarding St. Bernadette&rsquo;s and
    the summary Msgr. Stricker presented from the pulpit shortly after
    the St. Bernadette&rsquo;s review. Suffice it to say that the good
    Monsignor must have acquired his rose-colored glasses from Ronald
    Reagan&rsquo;s optometrist.</p>
  <p class="western">The program comprised two years of formal
    training, followed by ordination and a year of supervised
    internship. To qualify for acceptance into the program it was held
    that &ldquo;a man must be respected and <i>involved</i> in his
    community and have a firm intention of <i>permanent commitment</i>
    to a life of service in the Church.&rdquo; Admission to the program
    began with submittal of a hand-written letter from the applicant
    outlining his reasons for interest in the program. This is followed
    by intensive interviews of the applicant <i>and his wife</i>.
    Naturally I had no difficulty with the latter part. Kathleen was
    simply a marvelous asset. Beyond that, I must have really generated
    a snow-job of blizzard proportions, because up to that time I had
    had a zero involvement with my community. As for the permanent
    commitment aspect, I&rsquo;m certain that at that time I did indeed
    feel so committed in mind and body.</p>
  <p class="western">In any event, the foregoing recital of efforts in
    which I soon became totally involved certainly sufficed to meet the
    involvement requirement. The commitment requirement was something
    else, but the way it evolved was strange. The fact is, I was sailing
    merrily along, completely absorbed in the program, fully dedicated &ndash;
    until the final session of the first year (about Nov 1973). There
    was a midpoint in that evening&rsquo;s program at which we took a
    break. The priest-director thereupon announced that when we
    reassembled he would have the forms for us to sign pledging
    life-long allegiance in the service of the Archbishop. I thought
    somberly about this as I went to the head, and then turned, went out
    to my car and drove off never to return. I simply knew then and
    there, for the first time, that I just couldn&rsquo;t sign any such
    pledge. Strange! There had not been a hint of the slightest doubt as
    to where I was heading, right up to that very point. Strange,
    indeed.</p>
  <p class="western">I would hope my withdrawal might at least say
    something about the seriousness with which I make personal
    commitments. I&rsquo;m certainly satisfied that it does. Of course,
    I immediately wrote long letters to the Archbishop, the program
    director, and to Msgr. Corbett. The only distressed party was Msgr.
    Corbett, who was extremely worried about the confidential
    information to which I&rsquo;d had access as an imminent &ldquo;insider&rdquo;
    who was now a rank &ldquo;outsider.&rdquo; I assured him not to
    worry, and to the best of my recollection this constitutes my first
    and only reference to the entire operation. As for the
    priest-director, he was clearly upset at losing his most productive
    prospect. In fact, shortly after I left the program he invited me to
    a private session in which he outlined his plans to erect a Senior
    Citizens Home on the land immediately abutting the rear of the
    Josephite Seminary. He was positive that I was precisely the dynamic
    type of individual who could take it over, head it up, and get the
    job done. Well, hey, I know my limits (some of them, anyway), so I
    said &ldquo;Thanks, but no thanks!&rdquo; But in the immortal words
    of Rosanne Rosannadanna, &ldquo;It just goes to show you!&rdquo;
    Clearly, I had made an impression.</p>
  <p class="western">The question, though, really ought to be what
    kind of impression the program had made on me. Well, everything said
    about it up to this juncture totally misses the point! All the
    foregoing concerns externals &ndash; window dressing. It doesn&rsquo;t
    go to the heart of the matter &ndash; how <i>I</i> had changed, how
    <i>I</i> had grown, how <i>I</i> had assimilated a totally new
    perspective on life, on the Church, and on myself. This, I believe,
    is the crucial importance of the program to me, and I&rsquo;d have
    to say that this personal impact was simply tremendous &ndash; a
    180-degree turn. Let me explain. Vatican II began in Oct of 1962 and
    concluded in Dec 1965, but I didn&rsquo;t really become aware of its
    full import until my participation in the diaconate program
    beginning in Sep of 1972. I was a mere seven years late getting the
    news. (But, at least I <i>did</i> get it. A lot of people haven&rsquo;t
    gotten it to this day!)</p>
  <p class="western">The fact is that until this program I was a
    full-fledged, 100-percent, card-carrying Catholic of the <i>pre</i>-Vatican
    II mold. I was doctrinaire, tunnel-visioned, and accepted and did
    everything by rote. Now, doing things by rote is not necessarily
    bad, but it is important that one not lose sight of the underlying
    reasons for and meanings of things that one comes to do quite
    perfunctorily. It is important that we <i>remember</i> the root of
    the matter. It is also important that one look beyond the surface of
    Vatican II, and I had never done that. Like a lot of other people, I
    was totally preoccupied by relative superficialities such as the
    Mass being said in English, the priest facing the congregation, and
    the relaxation of fasting and abstinence regulations and the like. I
    remained totally oblivious to the real achievements of Vatican II.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, the diaconate experience was like a lifting
    of scales from my eyes, and I gradually became aware that something
    really tremendous had occurred. The Church had formally gotten on
    the record that it had shifted its focus from the medieval dark ages
    to the 20th century. The emphasis was shifted from doctrinal
    questions (such as permeated Trent and Vatican I) to pastoral
    affairs (a genuine concern for administering to the faithful).
    Still, I concur with theologian Eduard Shillebeeckx that the
    pastoral character of Vatican II is nothing more than the expression
    of a new sensitivity to dogmatic truths. In this perspective the
    Council is seen as a creative force in Catholic thought and not as
    merely an authoritative sanction of already existing trends.</p>
  <p class="western">The Council not only consolidated the past, it
    also gave a new impetus to the present. It can therefore be expected
    to be a source of <i>continuing</i> renewal far into the future. For
    this reason, it was about this time that I presented each then
    married child of ours with a copy of <i>The Documents of Vatican II</i>,
    which I had found to be a fantastic gold mine of dynamic new
    insights evolved from seemingly dormant old theological
    propositions. Foremost among these exciting new formulations were:
    the <i>Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation</i>, the
    <i>Declaration on the Relation of the Church to Non-Christian
      Religions</i>, and the <i>Declaration on Religious Liberty</i>.
    Citing these three documents is in no way intended to denigrate the
    force and importance of others, but merely to underscore their
    outstanding significance. For example, Shillebeeckx refers to the
    <i>Constitution on Revelation</i> as &ldquo;in many ways the
    Council&rsquo;s crown jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">I am certain that Vatican II will in time to come
    be seen as a watershed reformation in the life of the Church, and
    not because of the superficialities alluded to earlier, but because
    of the innovative substance of the key documents noted. I don&rsquo;t
    wish to convert this alleged autobiography into a religious polemic
    (if it isn&rsquo;t already too late!), so I won&rsquo;t pursue this
    further, except to exclaim that it behooves sincerely conscientious
    Catholics to familiarize themselves with the documents of Vatican
    II. I earnestly exhort this of my children. Should they wish to turn
    their backs on their Christian heritage, that is their right, but
    they should at least endeavor to know what it is they are rejecting.</p>
  <p class="western">As my father did before me, we always sought to
    keep <i>good</i> religious literature readily at hand. So it is that
    I have farmed out books to my progeny from time to time. In addition
    to the Vatican II book, I similarly distributed copies of Merton&rsquo;s
    <i>Confessions of a Guilty Bystander</i>, C.S. Lewis&rsquo;s <i>Mere
      Christianity</i>, and James Burtchael&rsquo;s <i>Philemon&rsquo;s
      Problem</i>. I do hope somebody out there profited from them. I sure
    did. The only feedback I ever got was that Kathy once commented that
    of the books I&rsquo;d sent them she greatly preferred <i>Mere
      Christianity</i>. Thanks, Kathy!</p>
  <p class="western">One of the best fruits of my deacon venture was
    totally unexpected on my part. I soon came to realize that it wasn&rsquo;t
    an exclusively personal experience after all. Our whole family got
    swept up into it to varying degrees. This was guaranteed to some
    extent by the staff. The program was designed to involve the spouse
    as fully as possible. Specific sessions were held for the wives,
    both with and without the deacon candidates themselves present. So
    it was that to this day Kathleen is still a Nursing Home volunteer,
    and a regular volunteer with Silver Spring HELP, a community
    organization dedicated to providing emergency food, funds, shelter,
    transportation, and other services to the needy. Mary, too, became
    especially involved, taking a job with Fr. Burke&rsquo;s <i>Word of
      God Institute</i>, where she began working daily at the end of her
    school day at Maryland University. Maureen became a &ldquo;Candy
    Striper&rdquo; volunteer helper at the Nursing Home. Actually all
    the family participated one way or another. <i>E.g.</i>, John helped
    with the slide picture-taking, and others supported me in various
    ways on my many service projects. Then, too, there were regular
    picnics that brought all the deacon families together at the
    Seminary, and these usually included a parallel religious ceremony
    as well. All of this, though, was merely a sort of window-dressing
    for the real impact of the program on our family as a more loving,
    more spiritually motivated unit dedicated to charitable service to
    our neighbor. A wholesome sense of doing for others was generated
    and spread throughout our household.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, I guess I&rsquo;ve about shot my wad re the
    deacon venture, and that brings us back to the thread of our story,
    where we note that George Wallace was shot while campaigning in
    nearby Laurel on 15 May 1972. He was then rushed to even nearer Holy
    Cross Hospital, and so dominated local headlines for the balance of
    the year. Our country took a double beating that Jun of 72. On the
    17th a fairly famous &ldquo;third-rate burglary&rdquo; occurred at
    Watergate. On the 19th the watergates swung open with a vengeance as
    hurricane Agnes lashed the Atlantic coastal region, including our
    beloved Ocean City, wreaking an all-time-worst
    three-billion-dollars&rsquo; worth of damage. Meanwhile, I was
    continuing my outstanding ways, racking up another commendation from
    my boss for superior performance, thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">In addition to ongoing routine tasks, which
    were uniformly accommodated ahead of schedule with no degradation of
    customary outstanding quality, and notwithstanding such protracted
    special efforts as elaborated elsewhere, Mr. Wright also handled
    urgent, cumbersome, and exceedingly delicate special tasks of an
    unprecedented nature as typified by his successfully serving as
    DeptNav focal point for providing the Dept. of Justice complete
    record/file data as essential to comply with court orders anent the
    IBM anti-trust case.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Representative of the quality and variety
    of &ldquo;special papers&rdquo; are preparation and &ldquo;as is&rdquo;
    acceptance of: a citation for CNO signature and presentation of a
    Legion of Merit award; and the swift and fully accepted reclama (a
    rare item indeed) of a Navy-wide ad hoc personnel reduction caveat
    via a thorough and incontestable delineation of the full dimensions
    of intolerable potential impact.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The latter accomplishment was an
    unparalleled achievement in the face of the universally prevailing
    accent on austerity which resulted in arbitrary reductions
    (virtually across-the-board cuts) within the DeptNav. Budget
    operations have continued to be conducted in a manner exceeding
    normal requirements. Further, this period was characterized by
    almost 100% absorption of substantial (government-wide) pay raises,
    and an unprecedented mid-year voluntary surrender of a portion of
    previously allocated funds (perhaps an unparalleled event in all
    government annals!); all in a climate wherein most
    activities/offices were requesting fund augmentations. Further,
    where most activities/offices necessarily had to freeze promotions,
    ADPESO&rsquo;s promotion actions could continue to be accommodated
    as merited.</p>
  <p class="western">As we moved into July of 1972 the good news was
    that Mike was born on Martha&rsquo;s birthday, the 29th. This was
    also about the time Martha graduated from Maryland University.
    Otherwise things began falling apart. Tom Eagleton, McGovern&rsquo;s
    choice for Veep, confessed that he had indeed undergone electric
    shock treatment for mental disorders on several occasions, and had
    to withdraw after only two weeks into the campaign. On the home
    front we also experienced an electrifying shock &ndash; we learned
    that our eighteen-year-old Mary was &ldquo;expecting.&rdquo; Well,
    this would have been enough fireworks for our 4th of July that year,
    but there were more. The day following Mary&rsquo;s news flash I
    received a call from the Silver Spring police early in the morning
    advising that they were holding our fifteen-year-old Monica. This
    was definitely not to be one of our better weeks.</p>
  <p class="western">It was inevitable that at precisely this point in
    my diaconate training program the subject under discussion would be
    Paul&rsquo;s discourse (1 Tim: 8-13): &ldquo;Deacons &hellip; must
    be men who manage their children and families well,&rdquo; and so
    forth. To say that I was suddenly overwhelmed with doubts and a
    sense of failure would be to put it mildly, but <i>I</i> am not the
    point at this juncture. Our <i>real</i> concern at this point
    naturally became Mary. In a way, it&rsquo;s too bad that the full
    gamut of detailed recollections can&rsquo;t be set forth here, but
    such an invasion of privacy (Mary&rsquo;s and Laurie&rsquo;s) would
    be unforgivable. As Plutarch has already been observed to say: &ldquo;It
    is a part of wisdom to be silent when occasion demands.&rdquo;
    Accordingly, one shouldn&rsquo;t be confused into thinking that a
    necessarily superficial and almost casual reference to this
    real-life drama in any way reflects our attitude or deep concern
    with respect to it.</p>
  <p class="western">We rallied from our initial shock and unspoken
    &ldquo;how could you&rdquo; disbelief almost immediately, and became
    100% supportive of Mary&rsquo;s desires. You have to be a realist in
    such situations. You have to deal with matters &ldquo;as they exist
    and not as you wish,&rdquo; and do your best to figure out &ldquo;where
    do we go from here.&rdquo; I confess my initial questioning in this
    affair might have seemed harsh, but I was dealing with what the
    courts refer to as &ldquo;a hostile witness,&rdquo; that is,
    information upon which to base decisions wasn&rsquo;t readily
    forthcoming. On the other hand, I recall concluding this distressing
    interview by kissing Mary on the forehead and making the sign of the
    cross on her only slightly blossoming tummy. Then I sprang into
    action with my customary all-out energy.</p>
  <p class="western">I had to break the news to Kathleen&rsquo;s
    parents and to my mother. The latter amazed me with a rare deluge of
    compassion. The Kirks were fully supportive as well, and didn&rsquo;t
    venture the slightest judgmental observation. Next I consulted with
    our pastor, Msgr. Stricker; then with the Director of Catholic
    Charities; and then our lawyer-friend, Bob Carey. I was bent upon
    guaranteeing Mary every possible legal protection and every possible
    ecclesiastical benefit (such as assistance from various institutions
    operated by the Church for assistance to people in Mary&rsquo;s
    position).</p>
  <p class="western">With one exception (Blue Cross support) all my
    intercessions turned out to be unnecessary, as Mary intended and
    proved to be fully capable of taking care of herself. Beyond being
    unnecessary, however, some of these actions boomeranged. For
    example, the Catholic Charities director, who had seemed so
    supportive and helpful in a private interview, resorted to an &ldquo;us
    against you&rdquo; harangue on morality and family betrayal and the
    like once Mary was ushered onto the scene. I was so taken aback by
    this Jekyll and Hyde role-reversal that I felt physically ill. This
    incident totally shattered my already minimal respect for so-called
    <i>Catholic</i> charity.</p>
  <p class="western">It was the same on the legal front. Mary had no
    desire to enforce any rights with respect to the putative father.
    This was natural, since willful love on her part was involved here.
    Taking note of this, I eventually (after Laurie was born) cosigned
    to enable Mary to secure her own apartment, thereby endeavoring to
    facilitate a continuing liaison if such was her desire, and
    concurrently serve to facilitate paternal support. Again, the old
    boomerang. I learned only years later that this was interpreted as
    being expelled from home. The lesson here is clear: Why don&rsquo;t
    we <i>communicate</i> instead of playing word games and merely
    trying to divine each other&rsquo;s feelings?</p>
  <p class="western">Well, no matter, the advent of Laurie in due
    course was and remains a great blessing for all concerned: <i>A Deo
      Datus</i> &ndash; gift of God! Life always goes on and in the
    process we all grow, spiritually as well as mentally and physically.
    So it was that KT left home that summer for a camp counseling job in
    Florida. In fact all of us left home briefly that August for the
    Seacrest in Ocean City. Remember the lack of air-conditioning on
    those steamy nights? Remember the all-night noise from the adjoining
    Irish Pub? Remember the nightly lynching of Johnny&rsquo;s vulture?
    (Or was that our second summer at the Seacrest the following year?)</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow the year trundled into fall. On 5 Sep came
    the Munich Olympian Massacre, and the death of 5 terrorists and 9
    Hebrew athletes. By then I was fully immersed in the deacon program
    and that Nov I began my eleven years as a University Nursing Home
    volunteer. I also began working as time permitted at the Word of God
    Institute for Father Burke. On 26 Oct Charlie and Kathy headed west
    from Oakland for faraway Guam. What were Charlie and Kathy doing in
    Oakland, you might ask. Well, after Charlie got his wings at
    Brunswick, Georgia on 10 Mar 72, he got married in DC on 18 Mar.
    Immediately thereafter he and Kathy cross-countried honeymoon-wise
    for temporary duty in Oakland. In Dec <i>Life</i> magazine folded
    after 39 years of publication. On the 7th of Dec Gene Cernan became
    the last man on the moon as Apollo 17 concluded our 6th lunar
    expedition. All in all, 1972 was a very full year, but one could
    hope 1973 might be better.</p>
  <p class="western">The start was not an auspicious one: Miami
    14-Redskins 7, and George Allen&rsquo;s caution had lost us the
    Super Bowl. On 22 Jan the Supreme Court released its infamous
    abortion ruling. (It should be interjected here that an objective
    reading of the relevant documentation &ndash; and John and I have
    read it all &ndash; reveals that from a strictly legal standpoint
    the Court had no constitutional alternative to what it did. It
    therefore seems to me that the only &ldquo;general&rdquo; remedy
    available is in fact to amend the Constitution, which I don&rsquo;t
    foresee.) On 27 Jan the draft ended. John turned 21 that Aug and
    Herbie would have been 12 in May, so our boys were now out of danger
    &ndash; short of war, of course. This was the year of <i>The Sting</i>,
    and the year when LBJ, Picasso, and Edward G. Robinson died.</p>
  <p class="western">Now for the good news: Terri and Laurie were born
    on 21 Jan 1973, in that order and only several hours but 6,650 miles
    apart (Laurie at Georgetown and Terri on Guam). We now had four
    grandchildren; first two boys and now two girls. Laurie gave us a
    momentary initial scare due to a swelling on her head which soon
    subsided. On the other hand, we weren&rsquo;t even to see Terri
    until a month after her second birthday.<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote63anc" href="#sdendnote63sym"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
  <p class="western">Anne served as Mary&rsquo;s guardian angel at
    this point. Mary lived with Anne and Doug at their house in Takoma
    Park for the last few months of her pregnancy, and Anne drove her to
    the hospital. As hinted at earlier, one of the neatest things of all
    that my research of Mary&rsquo;s situation had revealed was that my
    Blue Cross would pay all of Mary&rsquo;s hospital bills, since by
    their rules she was still a qualified dependent of mine. So, all was
    not in vain, as this was a substantial bonus.</p>
  <p class="western">Slowly the year 1973 wended its way into March.
    On the 23rd, McCord started talking about Watergate, and the country
    hasn&rsquo;t stopped talking about it since. On the 31st, at one
    week past age 55, I retired after 38 years (including a substantial
    allowance for unused sick leave) of government service. A small <i>pro
      forma</i> retirement party was held. I believe this was at the old
    Washington Navy Yard O-Club. Kathleen attended, as did Anne. (In
    fact, shortly after this, Anne held some special celebration at her
    Takoma Park home where she and the rest of the children put on a
    &ldquo;Jack Wright &ndash; This is Your Life!&rdquo; [based on a
    popular television program of the era] presentation. Thanks, Anne,
    that was a really nice surprise.) Frankly, I don&rsquo;t remember
    much about my retirement party. I do remember making a small speech
    to which my sincerely stated conclusion was: &ldquo;Today, more than
    ever before, I can truthfully say I gave everything my best shot,
    and I envy no man. I&rsquo;m just grateful for all the blessings
    I&rsquo;ve enjoyed along the way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">I received no special award on this occasion. (No
    wonder! I&rsquo;m the guy that always wrote up the awards for
    earlier retirees.) Neither do I recall any great emceeing job, as
    was customary for such celebrations. (Again, I wasn&rsquo;t working
    that day.) Nevertheless my relief and joy was boundless. Now I could
    spend all day, every day, with Kathleen. This is what I&rsquo;d been
    working toward for 38 years (since our engagement on 29 Jul 1935 to
    my retirement on 31 Mar 1973). It should also be remembered that I
    worked only a three-day week my entire last year, as I used up
    accumulated annual leave so as not to lose most of an alternative
    lump sum payment to an inflated income tax rate. I also used up
    every hour of sick leave which couldn&rsquo;t be credited toward
    longevity for pension calculation purposes (and I was &ldquo;really&rdquo;
    sick &ndash; of work!).</p>
  <p class="western">So at last my professional career came to an end.
    I had no regrets. I was satisfied that I had squeezed every possible
    advantage out of my limited talents. Much of my work had been very
    rewarding personally. I was ready to move on. However, before doing
    that, I think the short speech summarizing my efforts, offered by my
    boss at my retirement party, should be incorporated at this point,
    thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">On 31 Mar 1973 after thirty-eight years of
    faithful &ldquo;MUSTERING,&rdquo; you are about to &ldquo;abandon&rdquo;
    the ship for that long-awaited permanent shore duty. From the year
    1936 when you entered the Naval Academy until the year 1973, you
    have worked conscientiously and diligently for the betterment of the
    Navy, and now, at last, you are about to enjoy a status we all, I
    think, look forward to reaching. It is in this context, Jack, that
    proper and due respect shall be paid to you, truly an <i>outstanding
      member</i> of the Navy team for so long a period.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Your career has been one of progressive
    advancement and continued effectiveness. This is reflected in having
    received at least three Outstanding Performance Ratings, two
    Sustained Superior Performance Citations, a Superior Achievement
    Award, and numerous commendations. The statistics are impressive,
    but they really tell only a small part of the total story.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The Navy&rsquo;s ADPE acquisition program
    bears your stamp of personal dedication. Serving at a time when
    automatic data processing equipment was being developed and
    proliferated, you, perhaps more than any other man, were responsible
    in formulating Navy policy for governing its acquisition, usage, and
    control. These labors, it should be noted, culminated in the Navy&rsquo;s
    ADPE policy being followed by other DOD components and other
    Government agencies. While you may be retiring, your keen foresight
    will keep the Navy in the ADPE leadership role for many years to
    come and serve as a legacy for the benefit of those who remain. In
    short, Jack Wright&rsquo;s input, both technically and editorially,
    will long be noticed.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Among your many attributes is <i>one</i>
    that is <i>distinctly superior</i> &ndash; the ability to express
    yourself through the written medium. True professionalism was always
    brought to bear when your assignment called for the written word;
    your superiors, colleagues and subordinates have all admired this
    extraordinary ability. In retrospect, your civilian career has
    included working for the Bureau of Ships, the Navy Management
    Office, the Office of Management Information, and the Automatic Data
    Processing Equipment Selection Office. Apparently you found the Navy
    challenging; obviously the Navy was fortunate for having the use of
    your talents for so long. It has been a good match.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I commend you for valued service and
    endless contributions. Please accept my sincere congratulations on
    this occasion, and for all who have known and served with you, we
    wish you many years of happy retirement. You have earned it.</p>
  <p class="western">I wasn&rsquo;t the only one &ldquo;retiring&rdquo;
    at about this time. Two other journeymen government workers tossing
    in the towel were named Ehrlichman and Haldeman. I suspect that
    neither of them could make my statement about no regrets and envying
    no man. They exited the government on 30 Apr, and by then it was
    clear Nixon was in the soup. The Watergate affair really took off.
    On 11 May charges of theft against Daniel Ellsberg over the Pentagon
    papers were dismissed. On 17 Apr the Ervin Senate Committee hearings
    began. By 25 Jun John Dean was on the stand. Meanwhile, George had
    &ldquo;rejoined&rdquo; the Navy even as I had been leaving it,
    having started work with the Office of Naval Comptroller as an
    Operations Research Analyst on 12 Jun. This was also just about the
    time KT was graduating from high school.</p>
  <p class="western">By then I was working around the clock for the
    Parole and Probation Office of the state of Maryland, and for Fr.
    Burke&rsquo;s <i>Word of God Institute</i>. Mary, too, had joined us
    at WGI at about that time. It was Jul of 1973 that was &ldquo;bombshell&rdquo;
    month. On 16 Jul Schlesinger revealed the Cambodian bombing outrage.
    That same day Alexander Butterfield revealed the existence of the
    Nixon tapes. On the home front, Maureen provided our family
    bombshell of the month, being picked up at Wheaton&rsquo;s Wards for
    shoplifting a 45-rpm record. It helped when I flashed my official
    Parole Officer ID card on the security guard at Wards. (Later my
    eleven years volunteer service at the Nursing Home gained my Mom
    same-day entrance when nobody else could get in without a long wait.
    Who says that bread cast upon the waters doesn&rsquo;t come back to
    you?) And, so to the Seacrest for another Ocean City summer respite.</p>
  <p class="western">Now we were into the fall of 1973. Martha and
    Gary were off to the Philippines for three long years. On 21 Sep
    &ldquo;Henry the K&rdquo; took over the State Department. October
    gave us the Yom Kippur war. That was the bad news. The good news was
    that on the 10th Spiro resigned his vice presidency for income tax
    evasion. On the 20th Tricky gave us the thrill of &ldquo;the
    Saturday Night Massacre.&rdquo; Then OPEC gave us the oil embargo
    and the resulting long gasoline line-up. Hey! I said it was good
    news AND bad news. Leon Jaworski&rsquo;s arrival brought some relief
    on 1 Nov, while the four Watergate burglars were sentenced on 9 Nov.
    On the home front, this was about the time I opted out of the deacon
    program, but continued in my various service ministries. It was
    during this period, too, that I read a translation of the <i>Koran</i>
    from cover to cover (something I&rsquo;ve never been able to do yet
    with the Bible). I was surprised at the respect and honor it paid to
    both Jesus and Mary, but overall was shocked with its lack of
    spiritual depth in comparison with the New Testament. Anyway, by
    December Ford was our new Veep, and Matt was our new (#5)
    grandchild.</p>
  <p class="western">The year 1974 opened with <i>Godfather II,</i>
    and ironically a lot of VIP&rsquo;s died that year: Chief Justice
    Earl Warren, columnist Walter Lippmann, Lindbergh, Chet Huntley,
    Duke Ellington, Ed Sullivan, and Jack Benny. My father&rsquo;s
    brother, my Uncle El, also died. It all seems so long ago already. I
    once read (in an issue of Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses&rsquo; <i>Awake</i>
    that our conception of the passing of time is a function of the time
    we have lived. Thus, for a 10-year-old, one year is one-tenth of a
    lifetime, and it seems to pass rather slowly. For a fellow of 55, a
    year is one-55th of a lifetime, and really seems to whiz by. Time
    was whizzing by for me now &ndash; and would seem to pass faster and
    faster. Surely all children become aware of how Christmases seem to
    come closer and closer together as they grow older.</p>
  <p class="western">Events moved swiftly in 1974 also. Impeachment
    proceedings began on 6 Feb. An event of some family significance
    also transpired on 20 Feb 74. Forever after we would never again
    simultaneously have 4 teenagers in the family, which we had had
    since 29 Jul 63. Imagine! living with four teenagers for more than
    10 years! And I&rsquo;ve got the gray hair to show for it. It was
    worth every damn one of them. Anyhow, the formal impeachment hearing
    opened on 4 May, even as the dratted oil embargo finally ended,
    along with the gas lines. Eureka! We also celebrated Jesse&rsquo;s
    birthday on 15 May 1974. Soon John was graduating from college,
    entering the job market, and that&rsquo;s sort of an epic in itself.</p>
  <p class="western">First of all, there were John&rsquo;s eclectic
    high school and college curriculums. Two of the hardest things I
    ever had to do in my life were to keep my mouth shut about long hair
    on boys, and be supportive when John initially opted for Phys-Ed.
    Somehow I (and John) survived both. First John shifted into
    journalism (and thereby gained a writing skill which has served him
    so well professionally). Later, as he advanced through college, he
    inclined gradually into political science with a special emphasis on
    Russian culture and history. As it turned out, all of this set him
    up perfectly for a career in intelligence. This pay-off had a
    curious aspect as well. He mailed job applications to some 35
    government agencies. He had one stamped envelope left over.
    Naturally, he then sent it to the <i>one</i> place which ended up
    tendering him a firm job offer! Providence?</p>
  <p class="western">On 1 Jul 74 Juan Peron died. Ho hum. On the 12th
    John Ehrlichman was found guilty of conspiracy to violate the civil
    rights of Daniel Ellsberg. Now, that <i>was</i> good news. There was
    more. On 24 to 26 Jul the House Judiciary Committee brought 3
    articles of impeachment against the Tricky One. Still, the highlight
    of Jul 74 was the enjoyment of our first Quality Inn summer at Ocean
    City, with George and Pat&rsquo;s family (then numbering only three
    boys) sharing an adjoining apartment. This is as good a time as any
    to mention that all previous references to Ocean City summers should
    be set back 3 years &ndash; that is, my 1973 report really describes
    the 1970 Ocean City event. Also, two of those summers were spent at
    the Stowaway. (I could say that I introduce these little
    discrepancies now and then to test my family reader&rsquo;s
    memories, and even more so to give them the delight of screaming,
    &ldquo;Hey! here&rsquo;s another screw-up by the Old Man!&rdquo; I
    could say that, but who would believe it?)</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, before you knew it, it was August, and
    John Dean was being sentenced for a conspiracy to obstruct justice,
    and Jerry Ford has replaced the Trickster as our president. And,
    Jerry was so right: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Ford, not a Lincoln.&rdquo;
    He proved it on 8 Sep, the real date that should &ldquo;live in
    infamy,&rdquo; when he pardoned old <i>Milhaus the Louse</i>. He
    atoned for this to some degree later by granting a conditional
    amnesty for some &rsquo;Nam evaders. About this same time the Lt.
    Calley conviction was overturned by an appeals court.</p>
  <p class="western">That fall (1974, or was it 1973 &ndash; how
    quickly we forget), I was by virtue of my association with the
    deacon program and Monica&rsquo;s intercession, a guest speaker to
    her Regina religion class. I don&rsquo;t know, really, how it panned
    out, but I was never invited back. I remember this as one of my most
    nervous podium experiences ever. I mean, what possible interest
    could a group of militant young <i>feminists</i> have in an <i>all-male</i>
    program! Another school involvement about this time was my interest
    in a college course KT was then enjoying about the interaction of
    the age, sex, and number of siblings as a factor in one&rsquo;s
    individual development and maturation. This was an entirely new area
    of formal study to me, and I found it fascinating, both generally
    and personally.</p>
  <p class="western">I had not yet started this book (though by now it
    seems I&rsquo;ve been working on it for a least 20 years), but it
    startled me to reflect and discover that, indeed, I felt a major
    formative influence on my own evolution was my interaction with an
    &ldquo;only granddaughter&rdquo; sister, and a &ldquo;sickly baby&rdquo;
    brother. For the first time I had some clue to my seemingly inherent
    hostility as a youngster. Apparently I had recognized mine as being
    somewhat of a no-win position. I&rsquo;m now convinced that parents
    can understand their own children infinitely better, if only they
    try and consider the inter-relationships of their siblings from the
    standpoint of the individual siblings.</p>
  <p class="western">We closed out the year 1974 with a real bang &ndash;
    a 19,306 mile trip to southeast Asia (SEA) that included stops at
    Chicago, Anchorage, Tokyo, Taipei, Hong Kong, Manila, Guam,
    Honolulu, and San Francisco. We found that United was the best
    airline, Hong Kong was our favorite city, and the President (in
    Taipei) our favorite hotel. We discovered that Honolulu was a
    disappointing rip-off, that we didn&rsquo;t like calamari (squid) at
    San Francisco&rsquo;s Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf, and that Montezuma&rsquo;s
    revenge was alive and flourishing in RPI. En route we had delightful
    visits with St. Anselm&rsquo;s Fr. Urban in Taipei, the Carmelite
    nuns in Hong Kong, Gary and Martha in RPI, and Charlie, Kathy and
    Terri in Guam.</p>

    Grand Hotel &ndash; Taipei, Taiwan &ndash; November 1974</h3>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">Our trip extended
    from 31 Oct to 21 Nov and was a personally customized first-class
    experience all the way. We encountered an airline strike in Tokyo
    (with an unplanned five-hour layover), the dynamiting of a mountain
    landslide in Taipei&rsquo;s Tarako Gorge (the &ldquo;Grand Canyon of
    the Orient&rdquo;) which cost us a mountain-top luncheon, and a
    typhoon (Gloria) in RPI. We were especially impressed by the
    serenity and unhurried pace of the always smiling Chinese people,
    and their obvious family togetherness and mutual support and respect
    (as, for example, little children playing while carrying littler
    children in a backpack). Our most Hollywood movie&ndash;like event
    was a sunset cruise around Hong Kong, sipping gin and tonics. What
    nostalgia of early Navy days, and late-returning liberty boats &hellip;
    the sights &hellip; the sounds &hellip; and the smells. It was sort
    of a reincarnation of another lifetime, a long time ago. We simply
    loved the little we saw of China.</p>

  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">The Philippines
    were another story. Our first and last impression was the same &ndash;
    poverty! The evident contentment of the Orient was also missing.
    Another lasting mental picture of a towering Martha waving hello and
    goodbye from the airport roof, thereby underscoring the shortness of
    the RPI male. The RPI women, on the other hand, were striking for
    their natural beauty. RPI also ushered in the family-fun leg of our
    trip, renewing acquaintances with the Toths in Carmenville, and with
    Charlie and Kathy&rsquo;s family on Guam. One unusual sidelight on
    Clark Air Force Base (the world&rsquo;s largest) was the picnic
    groups stopping by the morgue for ice &ndash; this same morgue (in a
    huge hangar) being the grim stop-over setting for returning victims
    from Viet Nam. Somehow this didn&rsquo;t strike me as a very
    cheerful way to start out on a picnic &ndash; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    forget to stop by the morgue!&rdquo;</p>

    Clark Air Base, Philippines in front of HFDF antenna</h3>
  <p class="western">Our first view of Guam was at night. The road
    from the airport to Charlie&rsquo;s house wound up a mini-mountain,
    and we stopped at an overlook to view Agana &ndash; a beautiful,
    sparkling, jewel-like sight. Charlie and Kathy saw to it that we
    circled the whole island, doing the southern circuit one day and the
    northern circuit the next. On the southern circuit we passed another
    Carmelite Convent (those cloistered folks do get around). In fact,
    we saw more surfers just off-shore from their cliff house than we
    were later to see at fabled Waikiki &ndash; could the surfers have
    been the nuns? Surely not. I wonder! We also passed by my old
    hang-out, the &ldquo;Top of the Mar&rdquo; O Club, but I didn&rsquo;t
    stop for stingers this time.<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote65anc" href="#sdendnote65sym"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
  <p class="western">A unique sidelight on Guam was all the houses
    with reinforcing rods extending upward a foot or two through the
    roof &ndash; which technically conveyed intent to add a second floor
    later, thereby qualifying for a greatly reduced
    &ldquo;unfinished/unimproved&rdquo; tax rate. Now, that is clever! A
    highlight of our stay on Guam was an afternoon at beautiful Tarague
    Beach, which rivaled anything I had ever seen throughout the entire
    Caribbean. The water was sparkling crystal blue and foamy white, and
    perfectly clear below the surface. Excellent snorkeling! All too
    soon we were off to Hawaii. Now, get this! We left Guam at 1905
    <i>Saturday evenin</i>g, and arrived at Hawaii (3,800 miles to the
    east, all over water!) at 0620 Saturday <i>morning</i>! You&rsquo;ve
    got to admit that is really moving <i>fast</i>! (The international
    date line, you know. We had <i>two</i> Saturdays.)</p>

    Tarague Beach, Guam</h3>
  <p class="western">It seemed kind of strange to be passing through
    customs in Hawaii. The fact was, you see, we were indeed re-entering
    the United States. Unfortunately, going through customs wasn&rsquo;t
    our only hint of being stateside. Gone was the laid-back pace of the
    far Pacific. Even after only a few weeks in the far east, the
    dizzying, frantic, and incredibly noisy &ldquo;American&rdquo;
    atmosphere was a sickening culture shock. As usual, perhaps John
    MacDonald captures the idea best when he says, &ldquo;Upon return to
    this country from any quiet corner of a foreign land, the most
    immediate impression is that of noise &ndash; continuous,
    oppressive, meaningless noise.&rdquo; What a frightening shock our
    shores must present to the first-time visiting foreigner!</p>
  <p class="western">I also rather imagine that Hawaii might better be
    enjoyed by approaching it from California than from the far Pacific.
    On the other hand, despite the enjoyment of the exotic and
    delectable seafood fare of the Orient, it was good to once again
    sink your teeth into a MacDonald&rsquo;s quarter-pounder. Not only
    that, but what should show up on early Sunday morning TV our first
    full day in Hawaii but the Redskins vs. Dallas &ndash; LIVE! Indeed,
    we were &ldquo;home.&rdquo; Our most unique memory of Hawaii was the
    surprise of the flood of Nip tourists. Edging through the
    Japanese-crowded Honolulu streets, you might easily think that Japan
    had won WWII after all. All in all, though, we found Hawaii to be
    rush &ndash; rip-off &ndash; rush.</p>

    <i>Two gems</i> at Waikiki, Hawaii</h3>
  <p class="western">Fortunately Hawaii was immediately followed by
    San Francisco, where (like Tony Bennett) I&rsquo;d long ago left my
    heart. It remains my favorite city to this day. Neither Washington
    nor New Orleans comes close. (My second favorite city would be a
    toss-up between Hong Kong and Paris!) Hey! I&rsquo;ve just become
    aware of my using the word &ldquo;I&rdquo;! The fact is, from the
    very start this trip was conceived as Kathleen&rsquo;s and my
    belated honeymoon trip, which was first precluded by WWII and then
    deferred due to multiple new family arrivals. So the word &ldquo;I&rdquo;
    should be freely translated &ldquo;we&rdquo; throughout the
    foregoing account. Certainly, I&rsquo;m reasonably sure Kathleen
    fully concurs in the recital of favorite cities. We couldn&rsquo;t
    imagine a better city than San Francisco in which to conclude the
    honeymoon trip of a lifetime.</p>
  <p class="western">In fact, the relatively unhurried pace in San
    Francisco was reminiscent of our Orient experience. We even took a
    bus from the airport to a downtown terminal, and then personally
    lugged our mere 55 pounds of luggage on the 4-1/2 block walk to the
    hotel. I assure you, we didn&rsquo;t hurry. Yes, friends, San
    Francisco is in spirit closer to the far east than to the east
    coast. It has charm, contentment, casualness, and beauty. It also
    offers truly outstanding Mexican food. Hot stuff! But never &ndash;
    NEVER &ndash; order calamari. That&rsquo;s squid, folks, and we
    didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
  <p class="western">Then it was back to Dulles, to be met by Anne,
    Jesse, Mary and Laurie, and Grandpa Kirk. (How thoughtful of Anne
    and Mary to think of him. No wonder we&rsquo;re so proud of our
    children!) As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, they then treated us to
    Leone&rsquo;s pizza, AND &ndash; Breyers chocolate ice cream! Try to
    tell us that we don&rsquo;t have truly thoughtful, caring children.
    Try! Anyhow we were indeed home at last, after 20,000 air miles and
    more than 43 air hours. So ended a most glorious honeymoon trip. It
    was sort of strange, though, watching slide shows on Guam of a
    previously unseen granddaughter. This was a delightful two-night
    mini-series affair, after which we felt we&rsquo;d known Terri all
    her life.</p>
  <p class="western">It helped in regard to missing Laurie, too. It
    had been the same at RPI, evenings spent thumbing through the family
    picture albums, thereby getting brought up to date on the Toth
    family epic. These picture sessions were a real highlight feature of
    our honeymoon trip. Still, as I say, looking at pictures of your
    children, and even grandchildren &ndash; on a so-called honeymoon
    trip is &ndash; well, sort of unnerving. It was, however, a
    beautiful and fitting conclusion to an otherwise &ldquo;nationally&rdquo;
    depressing year. In fact, it was a terrific trip which we shall
    never forget.</p>
  <p class="western">So we come to 1975, halfway through the 1970s.
    This was the year of the sensational Cincinnati triumph over Boston
    in a fantastic seven-game World Series. It was the year Chaing
    Kai-shek died, and Ari Onassis. Meanwhile, Jack Nicholson was
    &ldquo;flying over the cuckoo&rsquo;s nest.&rdquo; Mitchell and
    Haldeman were found guilty and sentenced to jail. Patti Hearst was
    kidnapped. Charlie&rsquo;s Katie was born. (Strange! Our
    number-seven daughter and our number-seven grandchild both named
    &ldquo;Katie&rdquo;!) The really first big family happening of the
    year, though, was the return of Charlie, Kathy, Terri, and Katie
    from Guam. This occurred on 20 Feb 1975 &ndash; Mary&rsquo;s 21st
    birthday! We all welcomed them, and then Fr. Burke celebrated Mass
    for the entire Wright-Haber families in our &ldquo;wreck&rdquo;
    room. So another happy homecoming!</p>
  <p class="western">But, almost before we knew it, Charlie and tribe
    were resettled in March to Pensacola, Florida. Well, at least that
    gave us another excuse to travel. Speaking of traveling, on 30 Apr
    the U.S. bugged-out of Viet Nam and South Viet Nam surrendered.
    Karen Quinlan celebrated by going comatose (she was to die 10 years
    later). On 22 May President Ford ordered the assault on the Mayaguez
    &ldquo;pirates&rdquo; with the resulting deaths of 15 Cambodians and
    23 Americans &ndash; not really the best odds. On the 25th we
    celebrated the birth of Philip. This would <i>really</i> be the
    first year we summered at Ocean City with George and Pat&rsquo;s
    family in the connecting adjoining apartment. This was the same
    summer that Moni graduated from high school, Jimmy Hoffa
    disappeared, and the Soyuz and Apollo linked up in space. But the
    really big news of that summer was that Mo turned 16 and took over
    the Red Pinto. Oh, woe is me!</p>
  <p class="western">Now, anybody can make a mistake, and in this
    regard I can hold my own with anybody. I omitted to mention that in
    May 1975 we began a study group series under Fr. Weber, a member of
    my old deacon program faculty. Fr. Weber is a prolific author of
    religious education books, particularly for children &ndash; a truly
    dynamic pedagogue. He was anxious for a diversified group (both age-
    and sex-wise) on which to test out some teaching techniques. As I
    remember, the group comprised Kathleen and I, George and Pat, Anne
    and Mary, Jane Conway (a friend of Fr. Weber), Larry and Dorothy
    Noel, and Callista and Hilbert Unger. We met once a week in our
    &ldquo;wreck&rdquo; room, after which we enjoyed a wine and cheese
    snack.</p>
  <p class="western">These sessions were a real riot. One technique
    Fr. Weber mentioned but didn&rsquo;t use was a gambit where he
    proposed to pass out sealed notes to each participant and then just
    await reactions. The note was to read: &ldquo;I think it might be
    best for the group if you just quietly drop out after tonight&rsquo;s
    session.&rdquo; Well, we all applauded his decision not to use it.
    Pat confessed she would have just gotten up then and there and left
    without a word. I imagine she wouldn&rsquo;t have been alone.
    Anyhow, this should serve to indicate how &ldquo;unusual&rdquo; some
    of the gambits he tried were. Never a dull moment. And, in fact,
    Anne <i>did</i> drop out of the group &ndash; all the way to San
    Diego. Now our family was once again spreading to the four winds.
    This pattern has never been reversed since.</p>
  <p class="western">The fall of 1975 was soon upon us. Franco was
    dying. Calley&rsquo;s conviction was reinstated by a higher
    appellate court. Mother Seton was canonized as the first U.S.-born
    saint. Patti Hearst was caught. Moni escaped from home to the
    University of West Virginia in Morgantown. She was to spend her
    first year-and-a-half of college there. Franco finally died on 20
    Nov., and on 27 Dec Johnny shed his freedom through marriage to
    Patti Ford. Suddenly it was 1976. The world&rsquo;s population
    reached the 4 billion mark, but the count was no longer to include
    Mayor Daley of Chicago, Mao, Chou En-lai, Nelson Rockefeller, or
    Monsignor Stricker.</p>
  <p class="western">At the same time the <i>Word of God Institute</i>
    was to no longer include me. I terminated my services there with the
    filing of the financial statement and tax return for the year 1974
    in early Jan 1975. It was like jumping off a treadmill. The job had
    become a burdensome full-time chore, with one frantic deadline
    quickly following another, and no respite in sight. I had to get out
    for my health&rsquo;s sake. I had never really intended such an
    around-the-clock commitment. After all, I was retired and merely a
    volunteer. I meant only to perform some service to the Church, if
    only to feel useful. I never really had any desire to be merely a
    country club daily golfer and card player. But this had just gotten
    to be too much, so I tidied up all the books and reports and bailed
    out.</p>
  <p class="western">There was also, to be sure, a philosophical basis
    for my pulling out of WGI at that time. We had a fundamental
    disagreement regarding how best to fulfill the WGI mission, which
    was to somehow generate better Catholic preaching. Fr. Burke sort of
    followed what I&rsquo;d call the Billy Graham school &ndash; trying
    to mesmerize a multitude. I inclined to a one-on-one concept of
    preaching. Perhaps I can best summarize my point of view (to which I
    still adhere) by quoting from a 1982 Christmas Day letter of mine to
    Fr. Burke, thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Preaching is at root a form of selling, and
    selling/buying is an intensely personal and singular sort of thing.
    Nobody ever sells an <i>audience</i> on anything. Things, including
    theological propositions, are only sold to individuals. Consider
    Arthur Godfrey, one of the first and perhaps the greatest hucksters
    ever produced by modern radio/TV communications. His <i>unique</i>
    stock in trade was his uncommon ability to convey the notion to each
    and every listener/viewer that he was speaking confidentially to
    that listener/viewer <i>alone</i>.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">In his little gem of a book, <i>The Gospel
    to Every Creature</i>, Cardinal Suenens makes the point that
    conversion is invariably a one-on-one process. (Too often advice to
    preachers focuses on the preacher when, to be successful, it should
    focus on the listener/viewer. You don&rsquo;t love humanity, you
    love a human being. So it is with communication &ndash; it is always
    with one person. Every crowd is made up of individuals. You&rsquo;ve
    got to reach the individual.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, you get the idea. Fr. Burke wasn&rsquo;t
    buying. (By the way, preaching hasn&rsquo;t shown much improvement
    either.) Again, this all seems so long ago, but that is beside the
    point. We are speaking of Feb 1976, and as of then I was 58 years
    old, and finally I was <i>really</i> retired! What I really mean, of
    course, is that I was retired from formal public service. One never
    retires from being a parent &ndash; or a concerned Christian.
    Nevertheless, a word of praise is in order re formal public
    VOLUNTEERS.

  <p class="western">We read and hear every day of all the crooks,
    phonies, dead-beats, and rip-off artists roaming the world, but
    scarcely ever a word about all the fabulously <i>good</i> people
    &ldquo;out there&rdquo; &ndash; doing things freely for others, with
    no thought of any recognition or recompense. They are legion, and
    they are truly exceptional people. You meet them in hospitals,
    nursing homes, and in every phase of community service. God bless
    &rsquo;em all! Nevertheless, I couldn&rsquo;t any longer keep up
    with these good folks who put me to shame in every way. I had given
    it my best shot, but now I simply had to withdraw from the arena. At
    last I could feel truly free. It was a great feeling. It&rsquo;s
    still a great feeling as I write this in Oct 1984, but I&rsquo;d
    hardly say I still wasn&rsquo;t fully busy around the clock. I am,
    and I now know that is probably the way it will always be &ndash;
    health permitting. And I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.</p>

	&ndash;&nbsp;Martin&nbsp;Luther&nbsp;King,&nbsp;Jr.</span></p>
  <p class="western">So, this is 1976, and I&rsquo;m finally
    unemployed, and Kathleen and I did take up golf. We began 13 Apr
    1976, and through 22 Oct 1984 we played 108 rounds of nine holes
    each. (And I bet you thought I hadn&rsquo;t recorded all this.
    Shame!) We played a high of 23 rounds in 1976, and a low of zero in
    1981, the year of my heart operation. We played on Sligo&rsquo;s
    little par-35 layout, and to date our best scores are Kathleen-52,
    and me-42. Clearly, we&rsquo;re no threat to Nancy Lopez or the
    <i>Golden Bear</i>. (No! I&rsquo;m NOT going to tell you who the
    latter is!) But, it&rsquo;s fun. Even more importantly, it&rsquo;s
    good walking exercise for us both. Beyond that, it is one of the few
    games equally suited to both men and women, and suitable to any age.
    More than that, it&rsquo;s the only so-called sport that is
    genuinely a sport. That is, courtesy, proper conduct, mutual respect
    and honesty uniformly prevail. You won&rsquo;t find a bratty nerd
    like John McEnroe or a dirt-kicking jerk like Billy Martin on the
    golf links.</p>
  <p class="western">Golf was the single exception even in the
    so-called &ldquo;golden age of sports&rdquo; back in the 1920s.
    These were the days of Dempsey in boxing, Tilden in tennis, Ruth in
    baseball, and Bobby Jones in golf. Dempsey was a draft dodger,
    Tilden was a homo, and Ruth a boozer and womanizer. Only Jones was a
    proper gentleman and fit subject for youthful emulation &ndash; a
    genuine hero. Two examples of his class may suffice. His was the day
    of wooden-shafted clubs, separately acquired. Whereas today you can
    readily pick up a set of precision <i>matched</i> steel-shafted
    clubs, in those days you were at the mercy of nature&rsquo;s
    less-than-uniform wooden shafts. Well, it happened that Jones always
    had a little trouble with one of his &ldquo;irons.&rdquo; When
    modern testing methods finally made the scene (years after his
    retirement), it was found that all of his hand-picked clubs were
    precisely matched in weight and balance &ndash; except for the
    troubling club, which was &ldquo;off&rdquo; in weight by some
    microscopic amount. That should testify to his high degree of
    professionalism.</p>
  <p class="western">As to his heroic stature, he was struck by a
    crippling disease while still a very young man. A sports writer once
    (and only once) asked him, &ldquo;Bobby, tell me about this disease,
    how bad is it?&rdquo; Medical experts have since testified he was
    constantly in severe pain, but all Bobby said was, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
    just say it can only get worse. Now, let&rsquo;s never bring that up
    again.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll never hear of such class in any other
    sport. So, OK, for all these reasons we highly recommend it. And it
    need not cost a country-club fortune. As senior citizens on a public
    course, virtually in walking distance from our house, it costs us
    only $3.50 per person per round. That&rsquo;s cheaper than a movie
    and a lot better for you. Fore!</p>
  <p class="western">Speaking of sports, 1976 was the year we all
    enjoyed the Montreal Olympics from Ocean City. This was despite the
    fact that they were &ldquo;won&rdquo; by the USSR. Our women didn&rsquo;t
    win a single track and field gold medal. Our men won only the long
    jump, the 400 -and 1600-meter relays, and the discus, plus the
    biggie &ndash; Bruce Jenner&rsquo;s triumph in the Decathlon. On the
    other hand, our men virtually swept the swimming events, losing only
    in platform diving. At the same time, our women finally scored in
    the 400-meter freestyle relay and springboard diving. Beyond Bruce
    Jenner, though, the only names you&rsquo;re likely to remember are
    those of our gold medal boxers: flyweight Leo Randolph, lightweight
    Howard Davis, light welterweight &ldquo;Sugar Ray&rdquo; Leonard,
    middleweight Michael Spinks, and light heavyweight Leon Spinks &ndash;
    who would later dethrone Muhammad Ali. So we did have our moments to
    cheer, and it made for popcorn-party evening TV enjoyment at Ocean
    City that summer.</p>
  <p class="western">That September the Toths returned from three
    years exile in RPI to settle at Fort Walton Beach, Florida. At least
    they were within easy driving distance of Charlie and Kathy at
    Pensacola. The only other family event of note that year was KT
    marking her 21st birthday. So life went on and the world continued
    to spin &ndash; time whizzing by ever faster and faster. In March
    Patti Hearst was convicted of armed robbery, and the Quinlans got
    permission to pull the plug on Karen (who, as mentioned earlier,
    proceeded to &ldquo;vegetate&rdquo; on for nine years). In April
    Howard Hughes died, largely unlamented, especially by greedy heirs.</p>
  <p class="western">In May the Concorde whisked across the Atlantic
    on her maiden flight from London to Dulles, and Liz Ray effectively
    whisked Congressman Wayne Hays back to Ohio for keeps. Our own KT
    spent the summer in Florida as a camp counselor. We celebrated a
    glorious Centennial 4th of July, but then came the Legionnaire&rsquo;s
    disease scare in Philly. We landed a Viking spacecraft on Mars, and
    the Israelis landed on the Ugandans at Entebbe. In September we
    landed another Viking on Mars, and we landed a shiny new blue
    Chevette for 10106 Kinross Ave. How time flies.</p>
  <p class="western">You know you&rsquo;re getting old when you start
    marking time by noting who dies as each new year passes. The year
    1977 saw the passing of the ebullient Hubert Humphrey, comedian
    Charlie Chaplin in Geneva, Bing Crosby on a golf course, Elvis in
    his cups, and poor Groucho Marx &ndash; then on Fantasy Island.
    Meanwhile Leilah was born on 17 Mar. Kathleen and I made a 10-day
    flying trip to Florida in May to visit Charlie and Kathy&rsquo;s
    family in Pensacola and Gary and Martha&rsquo;s family in Fort
    Walton Beach. From Charlie&rsquo;s we enjoyed an auto side-trip to
    the Mobile, Alabama, Navy display, which included a tour of the
    battleship USS Alabama and a photo opportunity with a prototype
    Flying Tiger aircraft. We also had a photo opportunity at
    Pensacola&rsquo;s Air Museum, where Kathleen and I posed with
    Charlie&rsquo;s old plane type. At Fort Walton Beach we were
    introduced to the Toth&rsquo;s new baby, and enjoyed nice dinners
    out in an old fashioned RR car restaurant and at Navarre Beach&rsquo;s
    Holiday Inn (then housing cast and crew at work on <i>JAWS II</i>).
    A fine time was had by all.</p>

    <i>The Chief</i> aboard USS Alabama</h3>
  <p class="western">Once again KT summered in a Florida camp (or was
    one year spent in North Carolina?), then on 10 Oct, she set out to
    try and strike gold in California, traveling across country in her
    old tan VW van. They both made it. We had a really great
    Thanksgiving that year, with George and Pat&rsquo;s and Charlie and
    Kathy&rsquo;s clans joining us at Kinross for one of Kathleen&rsquo;s
    superb turkey banquets, complete with home movies via the borrowed
    Nursing Home projector and county library system films. Charlie and
    Kathy had just relocated from Pensacola to Lexington Park. We even
    overnighted with them once while they were temporarily ensconced in
    Kathy&rsquo;s Grandma&rsquo;s place on Pax River. This was about the
    time, too, when Mo relocated from Kinross to Frostburg State
    College. So we lost both KT and Mo that fall. Their moves were
    easily understandable. KT had graduated <i>Cum Laude</i> from
    college that summer, and Mo from high school &ndash; which sort of
    brings us to the subject of education.</p>
  <p class="western">My own two most often repeated remarks about
    education are: &ldquo;When you stop learning you know you&rsquo;re
    dead &ndash; or you might as well be,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    never met a Jew who wasn&rsquo;t highly educated.&rdquo; You might
    say &ldquo;Education is their shtick.&rdquo; This was the thing that
    always made me chary of Admiral Rickover. To him education was God.
    It was the only thing he really believed in &ndash; more so than his
    nuclear specialty, which he immediately repudiated upon his finally
    forced &ldquo;retirement.&rdquo; His devotion to education, though
    (it seemed to me) was hollow and humorless, totally without balance
    and slanted disturbingly toward the pragmatic &ndash; devoid of
    principles or ideals (a prescient statement if ever there was one,
    considering his subsequent censure for clear but unrepented graft).
    This scared me, or at least put me off. His notion of education had
    a certain &ldquo;true or false&rdquo; rigidity about it &ndash; no
    shades of gray &ndash; that was foreign and offensive to my more
    catholic taste and penchant for the flexibility afforded by
    imagination, initiative, and intuition. He was, if you will,
    &ldquo;digital,&rdquo; while I was &ldquo;analog.&rdquo; (The
    distinction is often explained as depicting a beautifully bodied
    woman as &ldquo;36-26-36&rdquo; as opposed to whistling while
    demonstrating her outline by describing an hour-glass figure with
    your hands.) To elaborate my notion a bit further, I find the
    concept of education POSTulated by newspaper columnist Edwin Yoder
    (he writes for the Post) both more appealing and much more accurate,
    thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The purpose of an education &hellip; should
    be to awaken the student to the value of his own mind, to instill in
    him intellectual courage. As a first step the schools might give up
    the idea of &ldquo;the educated citizen.&rdquo; To the best of my
    knowledge, I have never met such a person. I can conceive of a
    <i>self-educated</i> citizen, and I have had the good fortune to
    meet a number of people to be so described. Without exception they
    possess the value of their acknowledged ignorance, conceiving of
    education neither as a blessed state of being (comparable to
    membership on the Council on Foreign Relations) nor as a commodity
    sold in a store, but rather as a <i>ceaseless process of learning
      and relearning</i>. If in 16 years they have spent 10,000 hours in a
    classroom (roughly the equivalent of 13 months) they expect to spend
    another 50 years revising what they thought they had learned at
    school, turning what they know toward the future, not the past. [My
    emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class="western">Hooray and amen! I&rsquo;ll drink to that.
    Rickover&rsquo;s philosophy of &ldquo;fact absorption,&rdquo; on the
    other hand, seemed to me to encourage a robot mentality (which I
    should judge is exactly what he wanted in his minions &ndash; sort
    of intellectual eunuchs). In this overall connection, one of my
    favorite tributes came to me some seven years after retirement from
    a former female employee, a young black girl, who wrote me a
    beautiful thank-you note for having once encouraged her never to
    stop studying if she wanted to keep on growing. I really appreciated
    that.</p>
  <p class="western">While on the subject of tributes, we got another
    nice one that year, an 8 Sep 77 letter from a young neighbor named
    Jeff who lived with the Garvins, thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Hello &ndash; I just wanted to write to
    thank you all for the birthday cards that you sent, they really made
    all things lighter, and in here [the Montgomery County Detention
    Center] that means the world. This place tends to take away a lot of
    the real outside world that you love and miss, and it&rsquo;s people
    that show they care, like you all, that bring that world back into
    focus. I am fine and getting better as time gets shorter and
    shorter. Just one month to go, and believe me, it won&rsquo;t end
    too soon for me. So, give KT and Monica my love and thanks for the
    cards. And thank you for just being you, it means a lot to me to
    know a lot of people still care! My love always, s/Jeff.</p>
  <p class="western">Now that also was very nice. All I had done was
    contact a few of my old probation office friends to see what I could
    do if anything to ease his situation, and their consequent efforts
    tipped him off to this. Essentially, I was trying to clear his
    record so as to facilitate future employment opportunities. I hope
    he&rsquo;s doing OK somewhere!</p>
  <p class="western">Now, I have to confess I&rsquo;ve been holding
    out on you. The year 1977 really was unique, and I&rsquo;m not
    referring to Woody Allen&rsquo;s success with <i>Annie Hall</i>, or
    TV&rsquo;s success with <i>Roots</i>. Also, I&rsquo;m not referring
    to 25 Jun 1977 being the 100th anniversary of Custer&rsquo;s Last
    Stand. (I warned you there would be a quiz!) I&rsquo;m not even
    referring to the fact that Herbie would have been 16 that summer &ndash;
    and that would have made our car insurance exciting again. No, dear
    friends, I&rsquo;m referring to our 14 Jan to 13 Apr three-month
    visit by Sister Teresa from the Philadelphia Carmelite Monastery. So
    another unique invitee was added to our list of unusual house
    guests.</p>
  <p class="western">At this point, a paraphrase of a remark by
    Christopher Derrick in <i>That Strange Divine Sea</i> (his
    reflections on being a Catholic) seems appropriate: &ldquo;You may
    find this account electrifying in the scope and scale of its
    omissions.&rdquo; So it goes. Anyhow, it all began with a
    long-distance phone call on a snowy January morning in 1977. It was
    Kathleen&rsquo;s youngest sister calling from Philadelphia with a
    plea that we take her into our home. No problem. No questions. We
    thereupon made arrangements to meet her at Union Station. She got
    there even before we did (with a lay-woman traveling companion), and
    the three of us, Kathleen, Sister, and I drove home together through
    a light snow falling on already snow-covered streets. And thus this
    little adventure began. Perhaps we&rsquo;d best let Sister present
    her recollection of this unusual period in all our lives:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">During the renewal years of the &rsquo;60s
    and &rsquo;70s, I was failing to cope with community tensions &ndash;
    whether through sinfulness or lack of maturity or both, only God
    knows. Two periods of hospitalization for mental illness failed to
    bring about any lasting improvement, so I asked for and was given
    permission by our vicar for religious to spend three months with my
    family to relax and get my bearings. As my parents were both at
    Carroll Manor, there was no possibility of staying with them. My
    brother-in-law, Jack Wright, and my sister Kathleen kindly agreed to
    allow me to come to their home for this period of time. They
    arranged private quarters for me in their finished downstairs
    recreation room, curtaining off a space which included my bed (a
    long home-made sofa), and even an organ as well as a typewriter.
    They gave me freedom to come and go as I pleased.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Walking some blocks to church, or shopping
    or going to the post office by myself was for me as thrilling as
    traveling around the world. (Sister had then been cloistered for 30
    years!) I met my own friends and went to various gatherings of my
    own choosing, mostly charismatic of one kind or another, both
    Protestant and Catholic. I met at St. Bernadette&rsquo;s Church a
    girl who had recently been four or five years in Danvers Carmel, Pat
    Blasius, and who was teaching school and living nearby with a friend
    of Grandma Wright&rsquo;s, Mrs. Frances Parkhill. Pat was very kind
    to me. We went places together, such as attending a course on
    religion and mental health at C.U. given by Fr. Michael Griffen,
    O.C.D. She even gave me a valuable pair of walking shoes which
    served those three months as well as after my return to Carmel.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I also attended with Pat a course on Prayer
    at Georgetown U. given jointly by Fr. Thomas Kilduff, O.C.D., and
    Constance Fitzgerald, O.C.D., of Baltimore Carmel. We were driven by
    Xaverian Brothers (living in a house a block from the Wrights) who
    were attending the same course and had befriended us. My own father
    had signed me up for and paid for this course and attended himself,
    driven by my Benedictine brother, Fr. Dan Kirk&hellip; A Xaverian
    Brother, on his way to visit relatives, also drove me and my parents
    to Baltimore Carmel to attend the profession of Sr. Barbara Jean,
    O.C.D., who had transferred to Baltimore Carmel from Phila. Carmel.
    While there, I spent a most delightful week-end with a married
    niece, Cele (Meehan) Daub. She and her husband were very active in
    the <i>Lamb of God</i> charismatic community there. I also spent
    periods of time at the homes of my other two married sisters in
    Washington &ndash; the Noels and the Meehans. Those are the
    highlights.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">As you can see, the Lord was very merciful,
    seemed to provide me with many treats, preserve me from harm of
    which I was oblivious, and remove all anxiety, in spite of the fact
    that I was actually taking a &ldquo;fling&rdquo; and doing my own
    will in everything. My sister Kathleen even wrote to me later, for
    my good, that I was the most self-willed person she had ever met. I
    pray I will now be like the woman in this week&rsquo;s Profile
    column of our <i>Standard</i>, Peggy O&rsquo;Neil, who is doing all
    kinds of good things, yet boasts of having successfully played hooky
    83 days while at Sacred Heart Academy. May the Lord bring everything
    right, lead us mutually to salvation in His own way, and reward all
    those who bore my burdens for me during those three months,
    especially my own parents and principally Kathleen and Jack.</p>
  <p class="western">Sister then characteristically adds an extended
    postscript:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">In coming to your home I was, as far as I
    know, simply looking for a place of freedom to catch my breath. I
    must have known by instinct that I would find it there. Sure enough!
    Not even a locked front door! (It&rsquo;s locked now &ndash; nothing
    personal, a sign of the times.) Because I was looking out only for
    myself, I was not doing what was best either for myself or others,
    but it took me a long time to find that out. Nevertheless, the
    freedom to think and do for myself was still a favor, and I am
    grateful to all of you for bearing with me.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">As I had known both you (your author) and
    your Dad almost from childhood, and Kathleen was my oldest married
    sister, it was natural to ask hospitality of you. Though Sr.
    Kathleen, O.C.D., was my oldest sister by age, I would never have
    been allowed a stay at Baltimore Carmel, nor would it have freed me
    from specifically Carmelite tensions. So there I was in my cozy
    quarters in your recreation room, not at all concerned about &ldquo;mutual
    interaction, influence or impact&rdquo; on anyone until you yourself
    pointed out to me, in time, what a difficult thing it is to make the
    necessary adjustments to admit an outsider into a household. It
    seems that was my main difficulty &ndash; being too withdrawn. I
    give much more attention now to personal relationships in community.
    Thank you for awakening me to their importance.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Thanks to little Laurie, too, for taking
    the initiative to come and visit me and be my official &ldquo;guardian
    angel.&rdquo; I appreciated the initiative you (your author) took
    also in advising and admonishing me, writing many long letters and
    taking me to Sr. Mary Peace (an archdiocesan counselor to religious)
    I don&rsquo;t know how many times. In the long run, however, simple
    remarks may have done the most good and had the greatest impact.
    Remarks like: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of having brains if you
    don&rsquo;t use them?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take yourself so
    seriously,&rdquo; etc. So you see, it was not such an &ldquo;awesome
    responsibility&rdquo; for which you needed &ldquo;special
    qualifications,&rdquo; as you mentioned in your letter to me last
    month. You had a concern for me and ordinary powers of observation.
    Nothing more was needed or wanted at that time. [Editor&rsquo;s
    note: a lot of special graces must have been flooding down!]</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I&rsquo;m conscious of having made a fool
    of myself and tried everyone&rsquo;s patience. You yourself seemed
    particularly exasperated on taking me to the train station when it
    was time to leave. Consequently I was quite relieved when Kathleen
    said &ndash; briefly, sincerely, emphatically &ndash; &ldquo;I
    enjoyed it.&rdquo; Especially as my own mother&rsquo;s words were
    still ringing in my ears: &ldquo;Can Kathleen hold up?&rdquo; (With
    me on her back, that is!) I hope Kathleen meant that, as I <i>did</i>
    enjoy it myself.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">A little incident occurred when you were
    driving me to Port Tobacco that threw a quick light on my situation.
    There was a bumper sticker on a passing car that read: &ldquo;God
    loves you.&rdquo; Underneath were smaller words that I could not
    make out in time. Not long afterwards, another car passed us with
    the same bumper sticker and this time I could make out the smaller
    print. It said: &ldquo;Whether you like it or not.&rdquo; That gave
    me a good laugh which I shared with you, though I won&rsquo;t be
    surprised if you don&rsquo;t remember as it seemed to be a special
    message for me, not you. The extraordinary part is that I never
    again saw that sticker either before returning or on any of my trips
    out since coming back. I think I must have said at the time,
    subconsciously if not actually: &ldquo;O.K. God, you win!&rdquo; You
    can take credit for being a part of that turning point. [So ends
    Sister&rsquo;s summary. I can only add that she is in some respects
    a little too hard on herself, and that we <i>all</i> learned a lot!]</p>
  <p class="western">Would you believe we&rsquo;re now already into
    1978 &ndash; almost at the end of the decade? It was literally the
    end for Golda Meir, and Karl Wallenda took his famous dive from the
    highwire to the unforgiving street &ndash; &ldquo;live&rdquo; on TV
    &ndash; really gruesome! Film-goers rewarded Jane Fonda for &ldquo;Coming
    Home.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d always felt it would be a cold day when I
    started this book, and indeed a 30-inch blizzard hit Silver Spring
    that January as this thrilling prose epic began. (Well, OK, so I
    really didn&rsquo;t officially start it until 17 May 78. It took
    that long to thaw out.) With all the snow we suffered that winter,
    it was only natural that the Toths would relocate from balmy Florida
    to the arctic wasteland that was Detroit. On 24 Mar I hit the
    sixty-years-old barrier, and my ransom with the Lord immediately
    shrank from 50 to a cut-rate 15 shekels (See Lv 27:7).</p>
  <p class="western">To mark this being &ldquo;let out to pasture,&rdquo;
    I undertook my first vegetable garden. I followed the Ruth Stout
    method of throwing in the seeds, layering it all over with hay, and
    then just sitting back and letting the Lord do the work. Considering
    this rather lofty sponsorship, it was only a moderate success. We
    did have some fairly good fresh corn that first year, a few other
    minor veggies and a bumper crop of delicious tomatoes. Eventually we
    dropped one or another item, until now we only have four tomato
    plants each year. Our main problem was and is the lack of sufficient
    sun due to all the trees in or surrounding our yard. It was fun,
    though, and as usual I read just about every book on the market
    about vegetable growing. I&rsquo;m satisfied, however, that I don&rsquo;t
    have a &ldquo;green thumb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">In April the Senate approved the shift of control
    of the Panama Canal from the U.S. to Panama &ndash; an
    insufficiently applauded act of national wisdom and courage. In May,
    Patti Hearst finally went to jail, Mo cried as she picked up the
    keys to her brand new Pontiac Sunbird, and I picked up our Malibu to
    keep up with Mo. Also our first grandchild, Bobby, made his first
    communion. There is no excuse for anyone ever forgetting the date:
    5-6-78! In June Howard Jarvis&rsquo; Proposition Thirteen cut
    California property taxes a whopping 57% &ndash; and it has seemed
    to work out OK. On 4 Jul the whole family celebrated with a picnic
    in Sligo Creek Park. A memory that sticks in my mind is, as I&rsquo;ve
    already mentioned, that this was my <i>first</i> recognition of
    young Bobby Wright&rsquo;s (How old was he then &ndash; seven?)
    uncommon poise and good judgment incident to Terri somehow hurting
    herself.</p>
  <p class="western">Bob was to give us yet another example like this
    on the occasion of Philip&rsquo;s first communion in May 83. After
    the ceremony at their home on Scottsdale Court, we all set out for a
    restaurant brunch celebration in three separate cars. We hadn&rsquo;t
    been long established in the restaurant when someone noted that
    Philip, the guest of honor, was missing. George thereupon
    immediately set out to retrace his path and pick up Philip. The rest
    of us adults all sat around clucking over how could this ever happen
    and how awful it was. Only Bobby, again, had the presence of mind to
    simply say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll phone home to let him know Dad&rsquo;s
    coming for him, because he&rsquo;ll be worried.&rdquo; Right on,
    Bob, we&rsquo;re proud of you! Which reminds me &ndash; Bob was over
    one summer day for a golf outing with Kathleen and me. While waiting
    for his Dad to pick him up for the homeward journey, he happened to
    ask if by any chance I had a Baltimore catechism he might see. Now,
    I ask you, who else could reply, &ldquo;Which one do you want to
    see, #1, #2, or #3?</p>
  <p class="western">Later this same year we enjoyed Ocean City with
    all our then living (nine, through Leilah) grandchildren. &ldquo;Having
    a wonderful time!&rdquo; By August of &rsquo;78 Charlie and Kathy
    were established in their own new home in Lexington Park, and good
    Pope Paul VI was established in history, having died on the 6th. By
    the 26th &ndash; <i>Habemus Papum</i> &ndash; John Paul I was in
    charge. He was, by God&rsquo;s will, to become little more than a
    bookmark in the pages of Vatican history, reigning for only 33 days
    &ndash; a mere month! It&rsquo;s fascinating to note that St.
    Malachy&rsquo;s prophetic motto for describing him is: <i>demedietate
      lunae</i> &ndash; from a half-moon. Now, what is more closely
    related with a &ldquo;month&rdquo; in the universe than the moon! Of
    course these prophecies of St. Malachy, who in essence predicts
    there will only be two more Popes after John Paul II, are said to be
    apocryphal, but&hellip;!</p>
  <p class="western">You might be interested to know JP II&rsquo;s
    motto is: <i>de labore solis</i> &ndash; from the toil of the sun.
    <i>You</i> figure it out! (My interpretation: he&rsquo;ll follow the
    sun &ndash; the apostle of the road &ndash; world traveler!) OK, in
    response to popular demand I&rsquo;ll include the &ldquo;final&rdquo;
    (?) two prophecies: the next Pope &ndash; &ldquo;the glory of the
    olive&rdquo;; the &ldquo;last&rdquo; (?) Pope &ndash; &ldquo;Roman
    Peter.&rdquo; My interpretation? You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding, but
    here goes: &ldquo;olive&rdquo; suggests &ldquo;tree,&rdquo; suggests
    &ldquo;baum&rdquo; (tree in German), suggests Cardinal William Baum,
    the former Archbishop of Washington. (He would be a worthy successor
    of JP II, since his prose is equally incomprehensible!) Another
    possibility &ndash; Cardinal Bernard Gantin of Benin, Africa. Born 8
    May 22, he holds licentiates from Rome in theology and canon law,
    spoke for all African bishops at Vatican II, and &ndash; like Baum &ndash;
    has served in Rome. His name means &ldquo;<i>Tree</i> of Iron.&rdquo;
    Remember folks, you read it here <i>first</i>! I&rsquo;ll leave you
    to figure out the &ldquo;last&rdquo; Pope. I mean, I don&rsquo;t
    like to press my luck.<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote67anc" href="#sdendnote67sym"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
  <p class="western">Before going on, let us pause a moment to reflect
    on Popes Paul VI and John Paul I. (Hey! It&rsquo;s my book and I can
    digress anytime I want. More seriously, I obviously think such
    reflections might have value worthy of your consideration.) So, what
    about Paul VI and JP I? Well, let&rsquo;s take the latter first. JP
    I was only Pope for 33 days, yet he changed the manner of installing
    a pope for all time &ndash; dispensing with the unbecoming pomp of
    triple tiara, coronation and throne. No small contribution that!</p>
  <p class="western">Paul VI was something else again, with a reign
    upward of 15 years embracing most of the tumultuous 1960s. It is my
    opinion that he was <i>the</i> most significant Pope of my lifetime,
    including the present Pope JP II. I have every expectation that he
    will come to be labeled Pope Paul &ldquo;the Great&rdquo;! &ndash;
    if only because of Vatican II. Pius XII may have first conceived it,
    John XXIII may have initially convened it, but it was Paul who
    <i>reconvened</i> it upon John&rsquo;s death (and the death of a
    Pope terminates a Council in progress). Without Paul&rsquo;s action
    Vatican II would have produced little more than John&rsquo;s opening
    speech, because no decrees issued from the first session. So,
    Vatican II has to be considered Paul&rsquo;s monument, and what a
    monument it is! It is tragically unfortunate that too many people
    will recall Paul negatively in terms of <i>Humanae Vitae</i>,
    forgetting in the process that it was Paul&rsquo;s Vatican II that
    highlighted the ultimate primacy of the <i>free</i> conscience in
    terms of which that (and any other) encyclical could be and has been
    interpreted. More than that, I fully subscribe to the ideal he set
    forth in the encyclical. Our bodies are indeed temples of the Holy
    Spirit, and not to be exploited in &ldquo;selfish and purely
    pleasurable pursuits.&rdquo; Well, that&rsquo;s this man&rsquo;s
    opinion.<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote68anc" href="#sdendnote68sym"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
  <p class="western">So John Paul I died on 28 Sep 1978, and John Paul
    II succeeded him on 16 Oct. As though presaging John Paul II&rsquo;s
    &ldquo;Apostleship of the Road,&rdquo; Kathleen and I embarked on
    our first really extended trip in the US of A from 9&ndash;23 Oct
    1978. This was something I had always wanted to do &ndash; canvass
    all the beaches on the Atlantic coast between New Smyrna, FL, and
    Ocean City, NJ. This expanse offers quite a variety of delights, and
    I was eager to discover which might be the best. This little venture
    covered 2,009 miles, in 38.5 road hours, at an average speed of 52.2
    mph. (Since then, we have always estimated our auto travel time in
    terms of an average speed of 52.5 mph, with excellent results.)</p>
  <p class="western">We left Washington and spent the first night of
    our trip south at the Village Motor Lodge in Fayetteville, N.C. This
    set us back $16.85. That was in 1978, folks! Next we spent three
    nights in an efficiency cottage at Crafts Ocean Court, on the beach
    at Sea Island, Georgia. At every beach we actually checked out the
    beach, the surf, the churches, stores, motels, libraries, and local
    TV and FM radio reception. Obviously, we were still consciously or
    otherwise seeking out an end-of-our-days final retreat. Our next
    stop was Ormond Beach, FL, from which we spent a day checking out
    greater Daytona and New Smyrna beaches. Then we turned around and
    headed north, strictly up the coastal route.</p>
  <p class="western">Our first stop turned out to be our favorite
    discovery of the entire trip &ndash; Atlantic Beach, which is really
    the beach off Jacksonville, FL. We spent three delightful days
    there, even checking out the availability of private beach-front
    homes. We fell in love with a compact, modern little oceanside home
    which incorporated a fully glass-enclosed swimming pool for
    year-round enjoyment. More than that, there was a Catholic church
    almost within walking distance. Beyond that, it provided access to
    Jacksonville&rsquo;s 24-hour good music FM station, the only one
    south of a Savannah, GA&ndash;Austin, TX line. It seemed to be the
    most nearly perfect spot, but we still had &ldquo;miles to go ere we
    slept.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Now it should be mentioned that, while I
    elaborate only about the places we remained overnight, we actually
    visited and disembarked to investigate every beach along the way.
    Thus, proceeding north from New Smyrna, we checked out Daytona,
    Ormond, Flagler, St. Augustine, Ponte Vedra, Jacksonville, Neptune,
    Atlantic, and Fernandina beaches &ndash; all in Florida; Jekyll
    Island and Sea Island in Georgia, Hilton Head, Myrtle, Windy Hill,
    and North Myrtle Beach (a three-day stop) &ndash; all in South
    Carolina (Myrtle Beach, which then placed second in our hit parade,
    has long since depreciated in our estimation); Wrightsville (better
    named &ldquo;pebble&rdquo; beach) and Nags Head (really primitively
    wild by comparison with others) in North Carolina; Virginia Beach
    (overnight) and Chincoteague (second only to Nags Head for
    mosquitoes) in Virginia; Ocean City in Maryland (where we spent a
    night each at Fenwick Inn and the Sheraton to compare their indoor
    pools with our old standby Quality Inn; Bethany and Rehoboth in
    Delaware; and Ocean City, NJ.</p>

    Myrtle Beach &ndash; July 09, 1978</h3>
  <p class="western">I only enumerate this to tell you that you don&rsquo;t
    have to reinvent the wheel in this respect. The trip has been made.
    We cased the coast. Our conclusion: you have to go a damn long way
    to beat the convenience and delights of our own Ocean city, MD! Nice
    places to visit (but you wouldn&rsquo;t want to live there) are
    Virginia Beach, Jekyll Island in Georgia, and Ormond Beach in
    Florida. Hilton Head in South Carolina and Sea Island in Georgia are
    fine, but are really Rolls-Royce communities. Overall, if we were
    going to settle in, we still think Atlantic Beach, FL, (the Turtle
    Inn) has the most to offer, and it would remain our number one
    choice &ndash; EXCEPT for the convenience and the closer family
    orientation of dear old Ocean City, MD. Really, kids, you can&rsquo;t
    beat it. Nor can you beat the location, style, and price of 17th and
    the Boardwalk &ndash; that&rsquo;s <i>Quality</i>!</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">Monica had turned
    21 in May and was a senior at the University of Maryland in the fall
    of 1978. As with KT and her course on the psychological interaction
    of siblings on one another according to their age and sex, Moni that
    year introduced me to another fascinating study: <i>groupthink</i>!
    (She also introduced me to the deluge of literature on the feminist
    movement, being, I think, perhaps the one among all our children
    most caught up in that new wave &ndash; a child of her times. I read
    most of her books in that area, too.) I found groupthink a more
    arcane subject, and most provocative. Groupthink might best be
    thought of as a branch of group-psychology that deals with those
    situations wherein an important decision-making process is governed
    more by a concern for the mutual approval of fellow participants
    than an incisive and impartial evaluation of the pertinent factors
    involved. Comfort and security is gained through concurrence-seeking
    behavior, which engenders the solidarity that comes with a &ldquo;we
    feeling&rdquo; fostered by shared illusions and misjudgments.</p>
  <p class="western">The leading proponent of this &ldquo;school&rdquo;
    may be said to be Irving L. Janis, author of <i>Victims of
      Groupthink</i>. Janis lists six characteristics of this defective
    process: (1) limiting discussion to only a few alternatives, (2)
    failing to re-examine the course initially favored by the majority,
    (3) neglecting alternatives initially rejected without adequate
    evaluation, (4) failing to elicit the testimony of experts, (5)
    opting selectively for only supporting facts, and (6) failing to
    consider potential obstacles to anticipated success. I commend this
    litany to any of my progeny still operating as a decision-maker in
    the market place of life. Janis&rsquo;s book demonstrates the
    weakness of the process through the dissecting of four national
    fiascoes: the Bay of Pigs, the Korean and Viet Nam wars, and the
    disaster at Pearl Harbor. Fascinating! He then explicates the other
    (heads-up) side of the coin through a review of the Cuban Missile
    Crisis and the making of the Marshall Plan. Thanks for the
    education, Monica.</p>
  <p class="western">Thus we come, but not quite, to the end of 1978.
    Mary was then living on nearby Dallas Avenue with Bill and Laurie,
    and had initiated two annual highlights: an Easter Brunch, and a
    Christmas Eve party complete with door-to-door caroling. (We sure
    miss those happy traditions, Mary!) Along with the glad there is
    always some sad. On 13 December my mother left Kinross Avenue for
    good for the University Nursing Home for four days short of three
    years, until her death at Holy Cross on 9 December 1981.</p>
  <p class="western">Of course Mom&rsquo;s leaving Kinross at this
    time was a Godsend to Kathleen. Mom had never been easy to live
    with. As I may have already mentioned, my sister literally moved to
    Baltimore largely to escape her. My brother&rsquo;s wife, Mary,
    rarely had her into her home and never once visited her in her
    declining years. No impugning intended, just facts. These ladies had
    their reasons, as did Kathleen. After all, my devoted spouse had by
    now raised nine full-grown children, and yet was a virtual captive
    in our own house. She couldn&rsquo;t go to the corner store even for
    a moment without first having provided for my very demanding mother.
    Mother&rsquo;s trip to the hospital was providential for me as well.
    I could both see and sense Kathleen&rsquo;s disintegration under
    mother&rsquo;s pressure before my very eyes, and yet I seemed
    powerless to come up with a solution. Thanks be to God &ndash; <i>He</i>
    solved our problem, and not a moment too soon.</p>
  <p class="western">I found myself in a really bizarre situation at
    this time. On the one hand, my first allegiance was to my
    long-suffering spouse, who had really not yet &ndash; at this late
    date &ndash; truly had a home of her own, to which she was clearly
    entitled. Now her health was suffering, to boot. Then there was my
    helpless, aging mother. I was by then sufficiently into this
    autobiography to have recognized that, despite a long enduring
    childhood illusion to the contrary, I was my mother&rsquo;s child
    rather than my father&rsquo;s. I had long since come to realize, as
    I traced my evolution through these pages, that everything about my
    character that I prized, that had helped me achieve whatever
    successes in life I had enjoyed, were most directly attributable to
    my mother.</p>
  <p class="western">At the same time, I had come to realize equally
    well that I did <i>not</i> possess some of the traits I had always
    most admired in my father. I did not share his intellectual acuity,
    but rather was a plodder like my mother. I did not share his
    gregarious people-loving good nature, but was a reclusive &ldquo;loner&rdquo;
    in my mother&rsquo;s image. I never shared my father&rsquo;s
    unshakable self-confidence so much as I suffered mother&rsquo;s
    insecurity. I did not share my father&rsquo;s heroic patience, but
    indeed reflected my mother&rsquo;s vicious temper. On every count my
    character bore the imprint of my mother. Of course, there was (I
    hope I may properly claim this) one significant difference. One
    learns from negatives as well as (if not more so) from positives.
    When I saw a negative like my mother&rsquo;s fierce anger in action,
    I resolved (no matter how often I failed, and still fail) to not be
    like that. I consciously tried to put these negatives to work for
    me, to channel them into constructive action.</p>
  <p class="western">I can&rsquo;t with any degree of sustained
    modesty pursue the latter point further, but it is critical that the
    reader understand that I think this is perhaps the <i>key point</i>
    in trying to understand and know <i>who I am</i>! I&rsquo;ve tried
    to convert anger into perseverance. I&rsquo;ve tried to overcome my
    insecurity (as my mother likewise did) by prudent preparation. The
    latter effort overflowed into trying likewise to compensate for lack
    of intellectual dexterity by painstaking preparation to the most
    minute detail. I&rsquo;ve tried to overcome my naturally reclusive
    nature by focusing on making the other person feel good rather than
    worrying about myself. An amusing discovery in this respect is that
    whenever we venture out to meet new folks, we invariably come home
    knowing virtually everything about these folks (where they were
    from, where they went to school, where they work, all about their
    families, etc.) while they remain totally uninformed about us.</p>
  <p class="western">Again, realizing my lack of patience, I alone of
    my parent&rsquo;s progeny never even attempted to take up a teaching
    career. To complete the tapestry of my character, I must at least
    admit to three rather vital characteristics I <i>did</i> inherit
    from my father: a lively sense of humor, an open mind, and an
    unquenchable love for little children. Finally, from both of my
    parents I inherited a deep-rooted love for Christ AND for His
    Church. Thanks, Mom and Dad, for all of this, and of course we thank
    God! Nevertheless, the drives that really made me tick on the stage
    of life, if I may mix a bit of metaphorical potpourri (and why
    not?), were a redirection of what a purely objective viewer might
    have termed her worst traits. To be sure, God&rsquo;s grace must
    have been central to the whole process.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, by now I&rsquo;m certain everyone has lost
    the thread of the point I initially set out to make: I was then
    between a rock and a hard place &ndash; trying to reconcile the love
    and justice due my worn-out wife on the one hand, and the respect
    and debt I owed my ailing, aging mother. To make it worse, I never
    was a juggler. It took all my alleged talent to keep <i>one</i> ball
    in the air at any given time. It suffices to reiterate that God, at
    last, rescued us from this seemingly insoluble situation. There is,
    however, yet one other point to be made before moving on with our
    story. You may recall that just three weeks before my father died, I
    had &ldquo;closed the circuit&rdquo; by exclaiming on his last
    birthday, &ldquo;Pop, I love you!&rdquo; I had then kissed him
    resoundingly on his bald head. I&rsquo;ve already mentioned how good
    I felt about having done that, at long last, when the shocking news
    of his sudden death reached me soon after in Norfolk, Virginia.
    Well, something very similar had transpired, on my initiative,
    between my mother and me just before she went to the hospital, never
    again to return to our home, spending the last three years of her
    life in the University Nursing Home.</p>
  <p class="western">It is one of the remarkable fruits of this
    book-effort that, in discovering my own identity, I at the same time
    came to discover and appreciate, for the first time, the major debt
    I owed to my mother. It was at some point in the very writing of
    this book that I deliberately set aside my pen, walked into her room
    and sat down at her bedside, where she was resting at that
    particular moment. I slowly and completely narrated my evolving
    adventure of self-discovery and my emerging recognition of her
    leading role in my formation. She listened most attentively, and I
    thought lovingly &ndash; tears finally sneaking from the corners of
    her eyes. I concluded by saying something like, &ldquo;I just wanted
    you to know that I know all that, that I&rsquo;m most heartily sorry
    for any and all grief I may have ever caused you, I thank you with
    all my heart for everything you&rsquo;ve done for me, and above all,
    I want you to know I love you very much.&rdquo; I grabbed her hand
    and leaned over and fondly kissed her on the forehead. She said, &ldquo;I
    love you too, and I&rsquo;ve always been very proud of you.&rdquo;
    Well, I&rsquo;m glad I &ldquo;closed the circuit&rdquo; there, too!</p>
  <p class="western">Speaking of closing circuits, we&rsquo;d now
    pulled the switch on 1978 and were into 1979. Nelson Rockefeller was
    to die while being entertained by one of his female employees in a
    fancy NYC townhouse which he had provided for her. Poor Meeghan, I
    wonder what ever happened to her? Arthur Fiedler died that year,
    too, after 50 years with the Boston Pops. And John &ldquo;the Duke&rdquo;
    Wayne, after too many years of masquerading as a macho male hero.
    Congress even struck a special gold medal for him. Good grief, Lucy!
    Meanwhile, on the then-current silver screen it was <i>Kramer vs.
      Kramer</i>. We had our famous 36&quot; snow that February, the one
    in which Laurie built an actual igloo in our backyard, in and out of
    which she could actually crawl. Mo now had her own pad in Rockville,
    and had Kathleen and I to dinner during the New Year weekend. Mary
    threw another of her fabulous Dallas Avenue Easter brunches. We
    celebrated Moni&rsquo;s 22nd birthday with a chocolate cake at
    Kinross, with KT, Mo and Laurie.</p>
  <p class="western">That summer we visited the Toths with Mo along,
    at Westland, Michigan, and Moni graduated from U. of Maryland.
    Earlier in the year Kathleen and I had ventured out one evening to
    our first movie in ages &ndash; <i>The China Syndrome</i>, with
    Michael Douglas, Jack Lemmon and Jane Fonda. It was about the
    terrible potential of a highly probable nuclear power plant
    disaster. Lo and behold! <i>Within 10 days</i> (on 28 March 79) the
    same drama was played out in real life at Three Mile Island in
    nearby Pennsylvania. It was eerie. The on-scene &ldquo;talking
    heads&rdquo; were mouthing off, just like in the movie, about how
    there was nothing to fear and how it would be back on line in a few
    days to a week or so. That was five years ago, folks, and now it&rsquo;s
    clear that the damaged reactor will never be back on line (even as
    restart of the undamaged one is still highly doubtful). So much for
    the reliability of governmental &ldquo;talking heads.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Almost as earth-shaking in excitement as TMI, and
    just five days earlier (on 23 March 79) George had been dubbed
    <i>Doctor</i> George M. Wright by the George Washington University
    in Washington, DC. His degree was as a Doctor of Business
    Administration. His dissertation was entitled: &ldquo;Evaluating
    Management information Systems through Optimal Control Theory.&rdquo;
    Way to go, son! Interestingly enough, the latter such evaluations
    were more or less the business of the office from which I retired
    after 38 years of government service. I can assure you, however,
    that his insights passed several light years over my head. I say
    this even though much of it was so elementary or straight forward &ndash;
    dealing with &ldquo;cybernetic or closed-loop control, involving the
    Kalman filter and Kalman-Koepeke optimal controller,&rdquo; and
    disclosing situations wherein &ldquo;a business environment is &hellip;
    so stochastic &hellip; that control objectives cannot be met.&rdquo;
    Well, of course! And, wouldn&rsquo;t my father, our family&rsquo;s
    first &ldquo;Doctor Wright,&rdquo; have been proud. I know my mother
    was. (She celebrated her 92nd birthday at the Nursing Home that
    October. Kathleen and I, Mary, KT, and Laurie gave her a small
    birthday party there, complete with candled cupcake and Coke.)</p>
  <p class="western">This is the way it went the last few years of my
    mother&rsquo;s life. Both Kathleen and I visited her, separately,
    twice a week, and my brother Tom visited her once a week, and my
    sister Margaret came over from Baltimore about every two weeks. In
    addition Mary and Laurie were frequent visitors, as were Charlie,
    Kathy and their two girls, and our KT. So Mom might have seemed
    tucked away, out of sight and out of mind, but she really wasn&rsquo;t.
    She had plenty of visitors. Not only that, we celebrated all her
    favorite holidays and anniversaries with her, making up little
    family parties. We also tried to cater to her special desires.
    Kathleen would now and then take her some fried oysters, which she
    love but rarely got. I&rsquo;d always take her something, like sour
    pickles, carefully cut to small bite size, which she truly relished,
    or her #1 delight, a home-made chocolate soda. Her glee was evident
    and as high key as a small child&rsquo;s on Christmas morning.</p>
  <p class="western">Beyond that, when the weather was good, and the
    outdoors was especially beautiful, as in spring or fall, I&rsquo;d
    get a wheelchair, take her to my car parked at the front door of the
    Nursing Home, and then take her for a long drive in the country,
    trying to hit areas that she used to love on similar trips with my
    Pop in much earlier days. She would always express delight at
    familiar old favorite spots, like Olney, for example. Interestingly
    enough, she didn&rsquo;t even recognize areas that should have been
    even more familiar through more recent association &ndash; our house
    on Kinross, for instance. I drove her slowly by it one spring when
    the azaleas were in bloom, specifically pointed out 10106 Kinross,
    but she flashed no recognition whatsoever, despite it having been
    her home, too, for so many recent years. She especially enjoyed
    those trips when the azaleas were in bloom, and when the leaves were
    turning in the fall. Sometimes we&rsquo;d even stop, and I&rsquo;d
    buy her an ice cream cone. She would be tickled pink, and she was
    always so appreciative.</p>
  <p class="western">Thus is was that we had no regrets, when she
    died, about &ldquo;what might have been.&rdquo; We felt we did
    everything we could think of to make her last days as pleasant as
    possible. Several times, while at the Nursing Home, Mom had to be
    relocated to Holy Cross Hospital because of heart flutter. They
    would call us, and I would then go over to the hospital and sit at
    her side, holding her hand, until things stabilized. We had some
    great talks during times like this, and became very close. Some of
    these times, however, it would become clear in the course of our
    discussion that she thought she was talking to her husband, my
    father. I had no course but to go along with it. One of the most
    tender memories in this regard was the day she looked up to me with
    twinkling eyes, squeezed my hand and said (thinking she was talking
    to my Pop), &ldquo;We had a really nice romance, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
    I was deeply moved. And of course, I always had hoped I might be at
    her bedside when she died, still mindful of how she had stayed at
    mine during my crisis convulsions at age two. I didn&rsquo;t want
    her to die alone. This wasn&rsquo;t to be, however, but she didn&rsquo;t
    die alone. Christ was there, I&rsquo;m sure. In all events, I&rsquo;ve
    always &ndash; since &ldquo;closing the circuit&rdquo; &ndash; been
    at complete peace with respect to both my parents, feeling confident
    that both knew that I fully recognized my great debt to and deep
    love for them.</p>
  <p class="western">Meanwhile, Kathleen&rsquo;s mother, Grandma Kirk,
    had died somewhat suddenly on 21 August 1979. I&rsquo;m happy to say
    I had made my peace with her as well. Kathleen visited her folks at
    Carroll Manor about weekly. I rarely went along, but did make a
    point to go now and then, even though we would have them to dinner
    occasionally, as on their birthdays, or encounter them at similar
    functions at the Meehans or the Noels. So it happened that I visited
    Carroll Manor just a week or two before Grandma Kirk died. Kathleen
    and Grandpa Kirk were having an animated discussion about something
    or other, and Grandma and I were having our own little chat on
    another nearby bench outside. My deepest memory of our talk was that
    we were discussing death, and she was <i>so</i> ready for it, but
    always added &ndash; &ldquo;But, God&rsquo;s will be done!&rdquo; I
    indicated how much I admired her, and confessed my shame at taking
    so long to acknowledge my love for her. Once again, the &ldquo;circuit
    was closed&rdquo;! <i>Requiescat in pacem!</i></p>
  <p class="western">At the Naval Academy, at least in my day, at the
    end of your sophomore (Youngster) year, you celebrated &ldquo;no
    more math.&rdquo; Of course you still would have many highly
    technical courses involving lots of advanced mathematics, but you
    had no more pure math courses after that. In much the same way,
    Kathleen and I had a special celebration of our own on 3 August 1979
    &ndash; NO MORE TEENS! With Maureen&rsquo;s 20th birthday, our home
    was forevermore free of the dreaded teenager. We had made it, at
    last. As though in anticipation of this great event, we had more or
    less celebrated in advance, with a long-hoped-for cross country
    automobile trip, from 22 April to 22 May 1979<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote69anc" href="#sdendnote69sym"><sup>69</sup></a>.</p>
  <p class="western">First we visited Gary and Martha&rsquo;s family
    in Detroit. From the revolving restaurant atop the Renaissance
    Center, we looked into Windsor, Canada. Later, at Anne&rsquo;s in
    San Diego, we had dinner in a restaurant overlooking the Pacific.
    Even later at El Paso, Texas, we stood atop a hill and looked into
    Jaurez, Mexico. Thus we touched three of the four borders of the USA
    on this trip. Too bad we didn&rsquo;t conclude the trip at Ocean
    City and make the trip a real all-four-borders home run.</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, from Detroit, we went to Chicago and
    visited Sheriff Woods&rsquo;s home; then through the Arch, &ldquo;Gateway
    to the West,&rdquo; at St. Louis; thence Tulsa, Amarillo,
    Albuquerque, the Petrified Forest, and Winslow; on to Meteor Crater
    (with an interesting exhibit indicating that, with <i>our</i>
    current techniques, any Martians would conclude that there is no
    life on earth!); then the Painted Desert, Grand Canyon, Kingman,
    Hoover Dam, and Las Vegas (where the only money spent was at
    MacDonald&rsquo;s); and finally via Barstow to Anne&rsquo;s home at
    San Diego. En route back we stopped at Borrego Springs, California,
    to visit my old shipmate friend, Ace Foster, whom I hadn&rsquo;t
    seen in 31 years! This is the same guy who welcomed Kathleen and
    George to California back during the war (when my ship&rsquo;s
    overhaul was suddenly shifted from Terminal Island, CA, to Pearl
    Harbor, HI), and, as mentioned earlier, was later to visit George
    often in Balboa Naval Hospital.</p>
  <p class="western">Hitting the road again, we visited Mary&rsquo;s
    friend and our old <i>Word of God Institute</i> secretary, Ellen
    Gerrity, at Yuma, AZ (for a delicious meal in a Greek restaurant &ndash;
    something new!); then to El Paso; then on to lovely downtown Ozona,
    TX, next Houston (the world&rsquo;s dirtiest and noisiest city &ndash;
    making Norfolk VA, worthy of a &ldquo;House Beautiful&rdquo; spread
    by comparison); Lafayette, LA (and <i>please</i> accent the <i>second</i>
    syllable); New Orleans; grand old Slidell, AL; Tuscaloosa;
    Chattanooga; Bristol, VA; New Market; and finally <i>old faithful</i>
    Silver Spring. Surprisingly, we found our own Shenandoah Valley to
    be as beautiful a spot as any seen elsewhere in the entire USA.</p>
  <p class="western">This was a 30-day jaunt, with 23 driving days, 21
    motels, 18 states, 6,620 miles (Well, okay, so it was 6,621.8
    miles), 297 gallons of gas, and &ndash; most fondly &ndash; visits
    to the Toths, the Woods, Anne and Jesse, the Fosters, and Ellen
    Gerrity. This was, remember, at the height of the gas crisis, but
    apart from a half-hour line departing San Diego, we had absolutely
    no problems. This had been something I had always wanted to do, but
    I had never really expected to do it. We approached this trip as we
    have approached every other trip, including our already reported
    trip to Southeast Asia, and our subsequent trip down the Rhine via
    London, Paris, and Amsterdam. (And as, even as I write in Nov 84, we
    are planning a trip to Venice, Florence, Rome, Lucerne, London, and
    Paris for the spring or fall of &rsquo;85.) What is this M.O.? We
    simply proceed, step by step, as though we&rsquo;re actually going
    to take this make-believe trip, and &ndash; so far &ndash; suddenly
    it just happens. Let&rsquo;s hope we can be so lucky with our dreams
    for 1985. (We weren&rsquo;t.)</p>
  <p class="western">So we ring down the curtain on 1979, the year
    that: Charlie&rsquo;s family joined us briefly at Ocean City, Monica
    (then a bartender) became an &ldquo;instant&rdquo; nun for
    Halloween, Johnny held a Labor Day bash at Jug Bay, George and Pat
    were safely ensconced in Lutherville, and some folks named George
    Hernandez and Bill Koerner showed up in Christmas Party pictures. It
    all seems so long ago. Yes, folks, this is the same old year that
    brought us the Chrysler guarantee (1 Nov), the Iranian Hostages (3
    Nov), the visit of JP II to the US (1&ndash;6 Oct), and the death of
    Fr. Charles Coughlin (27 Oct). You may well ask, &ldquo;Fr. Charles
    Who?&rdquo; More popular than Bishop Sheen on TV in the 1950s, Fr.
    Coughlin was known as &ldquo;The Radio Priest,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
    Lion of the Airways,&rdquo; and the man of the &ldquo;mighty
    Wurlitzer voice&rdquo; (the Wurlitzer being the powerful hi-fi juke
    box of that era).</p>
  <p class="western">He could purr, roar, or drip honey, as the
    occasion demanded. It was estimated that as many as 40 million
    people heard his weekly broadcasts, and for a time he was one of the
    most powerful political and social forces in the country. He was
    ahead of his time in denouncing international bankers and pleading
    for a just, living family wage. He was ordered by the Bishop of
    Detroit in 1926 to establish a parish in its Royal Oak suburb. He
    thus started the Shrine of the Little Flower with a mere 30
    families. In an effort to raise funds he resorted to local radio
    preaching (getting thousands across the land to recite in unison,
    &ldquo;Little Flower, in this hour, show your power&rdquo;),
    graduated to network status, and at his peak enrolled nine million
    members in his National Union for Social Justice. The latter was
    seriously discredited when it failed in its attempt to unseat FDR in
    1936, and Fr. Coughlin&rsquo;s decline was then almost as rapid as
    his rise, though he still maintained a lusty radio voice until 1940.</p>
  <p class="western">The whole point of this recital is to salute his
    priestly commitment to obedience, for at that point (due to his
    increasingly vitriolic and purely political tirades against the
    government, with strongly anti-semitic overtones) his Bishop
    censured him to silence and ordered his full-time devotion to
    strictly parish duties. Fr. Coughlin, who was then receiving 40,000
    pieces of mail a week, forthwith ceased and desisted his radio
    endeavors. The only such sacrifice to come even close to this in my
    lifetime was when Fr. Drinan stepped down from a Congressional
    career at the behest of JP II. I admire both Coughlin and Drinan. On
    the occasion of the former&rsquo;s 50th anniversary of his
    priesthood, the late Cardinal Cushing of Boston observed, &ldquo;He
    was decades ahead of his time &hellip; the giant of his generation
    among committed priests &hellip; (and long before) clergy marched
    for the disenfranchised and dispossessed &hellip; his voice was
    heard throughout the land.&rdquo; Such a man should be remarked,
    especially as my Aunt Lucy gave me a volume of his earliest sermons
    for one of my birthdays.<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote70anc" href="#sdendnote70sym"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
  <p class="western">Suddenly (did I hear someone say, &ldquo;At
    last!&rdquo;), we&rsquo;re in the 1980s! In 1980 Bo Derek braided
    her blond hair, Mary Tyler Moore professed to be <i>Ordinary People</i>,
    Richard Chamberlain thrilled us all in &ldquo;Shogun&rdquo; (was it
    &ldquo;Ka nee she wah?&rdquo;), JR was shot in Dallas, and Carter
    killed the Summer Olympics in Moscow. This didn&rsquo;t stop Eric
    Heiden from grabbing four gold medals in the earlier Winter
    Olympics, or John Anderson from running with Olympic vigor in the
    presidential sweepstakes. Mary Cunningham was mounting the
    organizational ladder at Bendix even as would-be marathoner Rosie
    Ruiz was sitting down in the NY subway, while our own Monica was
    shifting her nest to Tallahassee and FSU for graduate work. Among
    those relocating to fairer climes marked by eternity were: the Shah
    of Iran, Alfred Hitchcock, Tito, Steve McQueen, Jesse Owens, Peter
    Sellers, and Jimmy Durante. The old guard was now rapidly falling
    away much like spent booster rockets shed by a skyward accelerating
    space ship.</p>

    Author at Daytona &ndash; January 1980</h3>
  <p class="western">The world was moving on, but not our hostages in
    Iran. The rescue mission desert tragedy occurred on 24 Apr, leaving
    eight Americans dead and another five wounded. Then Mt. St. Helens
    blew its top. Kathleen and I decided it was time for our first
    retreat as a married couple, so we weekended in May at the Loyola
    retreat house on the Potomac at Faulkner, MD, recharging our
    spiritual batteries. Nice! Mo turned 21 in Aug, and our
    child-raising days were over &ndash; but not our parenthood. Moni
    then upstaged Mo by marrying Jerry McGinn on 12 Sep 1980, with <i>two</i>
    receptions to follow. You can&rsquo;t top the Irish! It was a
    beautiful wedding on a beautiful day, much like the one on which
    Kathleen and I were married back on 14 Sep 1942. I especially
    appreciated being asked to do one of the readings &ndash; a piece
    about &ldquo;hanging on to a bit of your own space&rdquo; even in
    wedlock, from Kahlil Gibran&rsquo;s <i>The Prophet</i>. This affair
    had to be the highlight of 1980.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">There were other
    happenings of note that year, though. In Oct JP II issued what I
    still consider to be his greatest encyclical to date on God&rsquo;s
    <i>mercy</i>. Large sections of it are actually comprehensible. More
    than that, they are beautiful. His distinction of justice from
    mercy, I think, breaks new ground and is sufficient in itself to
    warrant study by all serious Catholics, BUT &ndash; in his torrent
    of words it has already fallen by the wayside and goes unremarked.
    Too bad. To go from the sublime to the ridiculous, on 4 Nov we voted
    Jimmy Carter out of the White House. That was the good news. The bad
    news was that on that same day we voted Ronald Reagan into the White
    House. If you don&rsquo;t think that was bad news, just keep your
    eye on that national deficit. Last night (as I write on 8 Nov 1984)
    we just voted Reagan four more years. I sure hope he lasts. God
    forbid that we should be saddled with that chameleon called George
    Bush whom Gary Trudeau (Doonesbury) says &ldquo;has placed his
    manhood in a blind trust.&rdquo; More than this, I hope we don&rsquo;t
    all live to regret this so-called second mandate for &ldquo;The
    Great Communicator.&rdquo; Since he&rsquo;s the only president we
    have &ndash; God speed!</p>
  <p class="western">Even as Ron was initially voted into the White
    House, Mary was moving into the Air Force. We drove her to her
    drop-off at BWI, amid a strange confusion of pride and sense of
    loss. May her career and her path through life be CAVU all the way.
    (That&rsquo;s &ldquo;ceilings and visibility unlimited&rdquo; for
    you earth people.) Once again Johnny sprang for a fabulous family
    farewell party at Jug Bay. We&rsquo;re really going to miss that
    beautiful picnic spot now that Johnny owns his own house nearer to
    Chesapeake Beach, but the family sure got its money&rsquo;s worth
    there. And so we come to the end of 1980. On 8 Dec John Lennon was
    shot, and Washington got a 30&quot; snow job. Then, almost before we
    knew it, we were greeting Mary for Christmas leave at BWI, and Mo
    threw us all a fantastic holiday brunch at her apartment in
    Rockville. All in all, for us it was a very nice year, but time now
    seemed to Kathleen and I to really be whizzing by &ndash; much like
    the Voyager had zipped by Saturn in late Nov. Everything seemed to
    be speeding up.</p>
  <p class="western">The year 1981 began well. Our hostages were freed
    by Iran on 20 Jan after 444 days of hell. The year also ended well.
    My mother, as already noted, passed into heaven on 9 Dec. In between
    there was one bummer &ndash; somebody got a quadruple heart by-pass
    job when they were unable to perform the planned quintuple by-pass
    due to inadequate connecting tissue at the heart itself &ndash; but
    that&rsquo;s another chapter in itself, and this one will stop just
    short of the detailing of that unique experience by an almost
    eye-witness. Eyeing the silver screen at that time one might have
    seen <i>Chariots of Fire</i>. Eyeing the TV, one might have seen
    Reagan being shot on 20 Mar, and JP II being shot on 13 May. Clearly
    it was not a good year for leaders in the public eye. Fortunately,
    both intended victims made remarkable recoveries. In between these
    two shootings, NASA on 12 Apr featured a more spectacular &ldquo;space&rdquo;
    shot, sending our first space shuttle Columbia into orbit.</p>
  <p class="western">Meanwhile we were enjoying some equally explosive
    events on the family front. Just as Moni and Jerry had celebrated at
    <i>two</i> wedding receptions, Laurie celebrated (is this really
    possible?) <i>two first communions</i>. First, Msgr. Foley held a
    special first communion at a Mass at Kinross, especially arranged in
    Mar to coincide with Mary&rsquo;s brief Air Force leave at home.
    Msgr. used the wooden chalice we had acquired in RPI, and then
    stayed for a &ldquo;Spaghetti alla Pugliese&rdquo; dinner. Later in
    May of 1981, as requested by Msgr. Foley, Laurie would join all her
    peers from St. Bernadette&rsquo;s in the regular parish first
    communion celebration. After this one (for which Mary was not
    present), we all went to Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s for a swordfish
    steak dinner.</p>

    Mary&rsquo;s commissioning &ndash; February 1981</h3>
  <p class="western">Mary was the center of attention for two very
    special events in early 1981. We&rsquo;ll take up the less fortunate
    one first &ndash; her beautiful wedding with Bill Koerner on a
    gorgeous May day in George and Pat&rsquo;s back yard. It was a
    beautiful family-style affair, complete with white-clad flower girl
    (Laurie) and cake and champagne. The service and very nice sermon
    were provide by a young Presbyterian minister of Mary and Bill&rsquo;s
    acquaintance. During the ceremony we all chanted several choruses of
    <i>Amazing Grace</i>. I don&rsquo;t know about Mary and Bill, but I
    thought it was perfect. Unfortunately, this alliance wasn&rsquo;t so
    perfect in the long run, lasting just a little over two years. But
    that&rsquo;s another story. The other still pleasantly lingering
    memory of that period was the family descent upon Mary at San
    Antonio for her commissioning in the Air Force in Feb of 1981. Now,
    that <i>was</i> a ball!</p>

    San Antonio surprise &ndash; February 1981</h3>
  <p class="western">It was a &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; affair and took
    considerable logistical genius to pull off. Anne left from San
    Diego, and Ellen joined her fight at Tucson. George left from BWI at
    2025 on 26 Feb. Moni left from Tampa the next morning. Strangely, I
    have no note indicating how Kathleen and I traveled or precisely
    when. In any event, Mary was expecting only Ellen, Bill, Laurie, and
    George (who was to swear her in). Nevertheless, the whole family
    (except for Charlie) plus Ellen and Bill managed to converge on Mary
    precisely in front of the O Club, just in time for the special
    pre-commissioning (swearing-in would come the next morning) cocktail
    party under cover of fast fading twilight. It was quite remarkable
    and tremendously exciting. The only sad note: John&rsquo;s camera
    was stolen on the plane.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">It was a proud
    couple of days for Mary and a great adventure for the family. Who
    will ever forget dinner at the San Francisco Steak House with its
    giant red guest-riding overhead swing? Or, the walk along the river?
    Or the hotel bull sessions? I can&rsquo;t imagine a better way to
    end this chapter than on this high note. Yet it all seems so very,
    very long ago.</p>

      XXI. HEART</h2>
  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western">All men are ordinary men, the
    extraordinary men are those who know it.<span style="font-style: normal">
	&ndash;&nbsp;G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;Chesterton</span></p>
  <p class="western">Now we come, literally, to the <i>heart</i> of
    the matter, and it had been a long time coming &ndash; at least 10
    years! Back when I was still working (I had retired 31 Mar 73) and
    driving to work in the little red Pinto, I often had to pull off of
    16th Street in the morning onto a side street. Then I&rsquo;d get
    out of the car, and sheepishly stand with my hands fully extended
    overhead (like &ldquo;This is a stick-up!&rdquo;) &ndash; until
    severe chest pains abated. (I can still remember my description &ndash;
    &ldquo;It feels <i>so</i> good when it stops!&rdquo;) Then I&rsquo;d
    get back into the car and continue on into the office. So far as I
    know, nobody knew about this. I don&rsquo;t recall ever telling
    anybody about it. Eventually (circa mid-1970), I went to a doctor
    for a check up, and he diagnosed angina and prescribed Isordil and
    Hydropres. The former is a so-called anti-anginal for the prevention
    and relief of chest pains due to an insufficiency of the oxygen
    supply to the heart. The second is an anti-hypertension diuretic for
    the treatment of high blood pressure. The problem was then seemingly
    solved &ndash; until Nov 1979.</p>
  <p class="western">To begin more or less at the beginning, on 19 Feb
    71 I underwent my regular biannual third-class (for non-commercial
    private pilots) flight physical, which is required by the FAA to
    continue flying. In fact, my last flight was 22 Mar 71, just nine
    days before my old medical certificate expired. You see, I had
    passed the new physical OK, but the special medication (which I had
    to report using) required validation by the FAA&rsquo;s Surgeon
    General. Well, the same was not forthcoming, and I was permanently
    grounded. So, all right! I had no real medical problems, and flying
    was getting too expensive anyway. Thereafter, all continued to go
    well, as mentioned above, until Nov 79. In Mar 79 I underwent my
    self-imposed biannual physical exam (a practice since discontinued)
    by Dr. Fitzgerald. I remarked that I&rsquo;d been taking Isordil and
    Hydropres since 1970 and hadn&rsquo;t had a chest pain or any
    problem in eight years, so how about knocking that off. He said
    O.K., so I quit the medication. My heart specialist later said that
    this had nothing to do with what subsequently happened, and I have
    no reason to doubt him &hellip; BUT &hellip; I almost died of heart
    failure eight months later. You can&rsquo;t help wondering about the
    seeming wisdom of that old clich&eacute;: if something is working
    O.K. don&rsquo;t mess with it &ndash; &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t broke
    don&rsquo;t fix it!&rdquo;</p>

    Fighting for my life &ndash; August 1972</h3>
  <p class="western">A radical decline had been hinting its presence
    beginning in mid-summer of 1979, and its progress was rapid. I had
    had to give up mowing the lawn before summer was out, and by
    November I couldn&rsquo;t struggle from my bed to the bathroom
    without getting increasingly severe chest pains. In fact, the real
    problem had now become how to get to the doctor. Somehow Kathleen
    helped me struggle down the basement steps into Fitz&rsquo;s office,
    and I really had to wonder if I was ever going to be able to get
    back up those stairs. The doctor listened to my heart, thumped my
    back and chest, and asked a thousand questions. Then he called his
    female office honcho in and told her to set up a session with a
    cardiologist. In a moment she was back to report that such a session
    had been set up for three days hence. The doctor exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh
    no, no, I meant to set it up for right now!&rdquo; Let me talk to
    the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">And so it was done, and Kathleen proceeded to
    drag me directly to the cardiologist&rsquo;s office. Thank God it
    was on the ground floor! It was located in the medical building at
    Forest Glen and Georgia Avenue, where Kathleen could drive me right
    to the office door. And so began my since enduring affair with the
    ECG (EKG per the German origination) machine.

    I finally gave in &ndash; January 1980</h3>
  <p class="western">After a most thorough examination, the doctor had
    Kathleen join us in his office and proceeded with a grave and very
    detailed report, complete with a disassembling model heart. It was a
    scene all of us have now seen on TV many times. The prognosis wasn&rsquo;t
    good. We would try to bring things under control with an array of
    medications &ndash; we were dealing with very low pressure,
    extremely erratic rhythms, and virtually no blood throughput from
    the heart&rsquo;s pumping action. The best we could hope for from
    medication alone was a short-term stabilizing of rhythm and an
    improved level of pressure. If and when that was achieved, then we&rsquo;d
    have to undergo further tests to discover the real root of the
    difficulties and what might be done about them. I was to report back
    to him two days later for a further check on my condition.
    Meanwhile, I was not to exert myself in any way. Well, no danger of
    that. And so Kathleen and I limped back home and to bed, on the way
    initiating our since continuing drug store subsidization (now nearly
    $100 a month). The cardiologist&rsquo;s medication program brought
    immediate and astounding relief which, unfortunately, was to prove
    to be short term precisely as predicted. Still, I was able to start
    moving again and was eventually able to resume a more or less normal
    life routine even as my condition again began gradually to
    deteriorate.</p>
  <p class="western">I got through all of 1980 without notable
    incapacitation, but 1981 heralded trouble almost from the outset.
    Early on the return of recurring chest discomfort compelled a
    so-called stress test. Actually, it&rsquo;s an ECG taken over the
    course of accelerated exercise rather than at rest. In effect, it
    shows how the heart reacts to physical loading to the point of
    overload. One can have a perfectly normal ECG at rest while the
    machine may reveal that the heart really goes bonkers whenever a
    load is applied. The test is especially useful in pinpointing the
    nature and degree of deficiencies with respect to blocked coronary
    arteries, the heart muscle itself, or the rhythm of the heartbeat.</p>
  <p class="western">In my case, I had to walk on a treadmill the
    speed and &ldquo;uphill&rdquo; inclination of which are gradually
    increased until your heart has reached a level judged to be 80% of
    its maximum effort. To figure your &ldquo;target&rdquo; heart rate:
    T=80%x(220-age). For me this involved working to increase my normal
    rate of 60 to 126. The test had to be suspended due to my exhaustion
    before I reached the target rate. I reached a point where I could
    barely get my breath. In my sickly condition this was really scary.
    (It might be appropriate to mention here that in a stress test in
    mid-1984 &ndash; before my relapse which began around Thanksgiving
    of that year &ndash; I got the rate up to 205 and still felt like I
    could deliver a finishing kick!) So it was that my failed stress
    test begot another test. This time it was an echocardiography, an
    exercise sort of comparable to sonar readings in marine language. In
    fact, the product is called a sonogram. This test provides more
    definitive results than the stress test, for example: the size of
    the heart chambers, the thickness of the heart walls, how the heart
    valves function, the presence of fluid in the sac surrounding the
    heart, etc. Guess what? This test revealed such a degenerative
    condition that yet <i>another</i> test was then indicated. However,
    the sonogram also marked the end of the fun-and-games <i>noninvasive</i>
    tests. From now on my body would be under attack.</p>
  <p class="western">We were now into the delightful realm of cardiac
    catheterization and angiography. This truly invasive test compels
    two nights in the hospital one before, one after. &ldquo;<i>EVERYTHING</i>
    you&rsquo;d ever want to know about your heart,&rdquo; to paraphrase
    the exuberant Ed McMahon, &ldquo;is revealed by <i>THIS</i> test!&rdquo;
    In addition to verifying the sonogram with greater specificity, this
    process provides indications of pressures within the heart and blood
    vessels, electrical activity within the heart, effectiveness of the
    heart valves, and the presence of any abnormal openings between
    chambers, plus it enables blood sampling from the recesses of the
    heart that can be analyzed for oxygen content. The physician can
    also deliver small electrical impulses to the heart and so control
    heart rate. He also gets a virtual blueprint for guiding any
    necessarily ensuing coronary artery bypass operation.</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, the actual process takes about
    one-and-a-half hours, and the best thing that can be said about it
    is that it hardly entails any pain. What they did was to insert a
    1/10th-inch-diameter 42&quot;-long plastic catheter in a vein at the
    front crease of where my right leg hinges from my belly, and then
    snake it through the vein right into the chambers of the heart
    itself. This is not only done with a local, you can (as I did) watch
    the whole process on TV. Fantastic! Not only that, they then inject
    a dye through the catheter and simultaneously record the heart
    action on videotape (complete with instant replay!) and on film for
    detailed study at the doctor&rsquo;s later leisure. At this point a
    further word is in order about that dye injection. <i>WOW</i>!
    Instant &ldquo;hot flash&rdquo;! There&rsquo;s an overwhelming surge
    of intense but pleasant heat throughout your entire body. You get a
    flushed feeling and have the sensation that warm fluid is oozing
    from EVERY aperture in your body. Somehow I rather imagined it was
    something like Christ might have experienced at the resurrection.
    It&rsquo;s a sensational high, I guarantee you that.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, it turns out that there are essentially
    three pipes at the heart (they call them vessels), and I was found
    to have so-called 3-vessel disease, which is a worst-case situation.
    The medical team wondered how I&rsquo;d been getting by at all, and
    warned me not to do ANYTHING until they could operate. That was
    easy, because I hadn&rsquo;t tried to do anything for weeks. I was
    further told that I&rsquo;d need <i>FIVE bypasses</i> among the
    three vessels. One was blocked off 100%, but the affected area was
    being fed from an outgrowth of another vessel, which was itself 90%
    blocked off. They had the pictures to prove it all. Incredible
    detail! So, there you have it.</p>
  <p class="western">All in all, the process was more scary
    (fear-of-the-unknown syndrome) than painful. It cost $2000 for what
    the bill termed a &ldquo;Coronary Cine-angiogram.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d
    finally made it in the movies and had been on live TV, but thank God
    for Blue Cross!</p>
  <p class="western">May was an awfully long month in 1981. I found
    out I desperately needed a bypass operation on the anniversary of
    V-J Day, the 8th of May, but they couldn&rsquo;t schedule me for
    surgery until 3 June! That&rsquo;s a 27-day wait, and I confess it
    was sort of like being on death row. I was almost afraid to move.
    There was absolutely no fear of the operation. The big fear was that
    I might not make it that far. Needless to say, I spent much of that
    period getting my personal affairs in order, and turning all
    property management affairs, including bill-paying and income tax
    reports, over to Kathleen. We went over insurance, survivor
    benefits, funeral arrangements &ndash; the whole Woody Woodpecker
    &ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s all, folks!</i>&rdquo; bit.</p>
  <p class="western">I even selected memorial Mass scripture readings
    and wrote my own obituary. (Might as well get it right, right?) The
    memorial Mass was indicated since my body was to be gifted to Johns
    Hopkins for donor purposes and medical research. (It still is.)<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote71anc" href="#sdendnote71sym"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
  <p class="western">The most unexpected aspect of all these
    preparations was the great spiritual serenity that engulfed me once
    I thought everything possible had been done to ease Kathleen&rsquo;s
    continuing alone. I felt at the time I was as ready to go as I ever
    might hope to be. I even had a sort of feeling that the sooner, the
    better &ndash; before I could muck it up, so to speak. And so we
    come, at last, to <i>Operation Bypass</i>. What follows next is a
    slightly edited version of my original Dear All letter report of 11
    Jun 81.</p>

  <p class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">1 Jun</span></i>:
    Entered Washington Hospital Center alone at 1300. Left my watch with
    Kathleen for safe-keeping. Never got it back. Very efficient
    immediate admission, followed by urine test, 3 blood tests, ECG,
    x-ray, and in room by 1330. Visited immediately by nurse
    practitioner member of Op-Team, who detailed what would be happening
    leading up to operation and advised of pre-op education session for
    me and all interested family members that was scheduled for 1300
    next day. Complete physical in room at 2000 by resident intern, Dr.
    MacKenzie, a proficient young black, who volunteered, &ldquo;You
    should have no trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">2 Jun</span></i>:
    Visited at 1000 by Mended Hearts rep who answered all questions,
    dispelling any and all fears, doubts, or surprises. Left a thorough
    booklet detailing outline of disease, operation, and post-op
    do&rsquo;s/don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s. Excellent. Briefing session at 1300
    attended by me, Kathleen, Pat, and Mo. Covered everything in as much
    detail as desired, including any and all questions, and a tour of
    the ICU where the most recent &ldquo;victims&rdquo; were on display.
    No need thereafter to expect any surprises &ndash; very comforting,
    excellent preparation. Met fellow victims for my op day. At 1400
    visited by female Indian anesthetist. She explained process, tubes,
    etc., and solicited requisite technical data from me. At 1500
    visited by pulmonary team rep who conducted breathing and coughing
    practice as extremely important to learning to breathe on own after
    having been fully on a breathing machine during operation, and as
    required for expelling potential lung-infecting material after op.
    At 2200 shaved from Adam&rsquo;s apple to ankles by 22-year-old
    black Jehovah&rsquo;s Witness from Trinidad who got into heated,
    razor-gesturing biblical debate &ndash; while doing my <i>genital
      area</i> &ndash; with my Presbyterian minister roommate
    (simultaneously being shaved by 25-year-old Catholic black veteran).
    Very unnerving! I pointed out to highly excited, razor-wielding
    youngster that <i>I</i> was not arguing with him. All sorts of
    unreal scriptural exchanges amidst razor-flailing arm-waving. The
    shave was followed by a shower with a special antiseptic soap. At
    2200 was impacted with pre-op bowel-cleaning suppository. It did its
    job.</p>
  <p class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">3 Jun:</span></i>
    (<i>&ldquo;</i><i>0</i><i>&rdquo; day</i>): All food, water and
    medication ceased at 0000. Roommate departed at 0900. He preceded me
    with same op-team. I was simply scheduled &ldquo;TF&rdquo; &ndash;
    to follow. At 1130 I received antibiotic and morphine shots, and
    Kathleen and Charlie began to gradually recede from my
    consciousness. I was wheeled into the Op-room at 1200. I dimly
    recall being fitted in the neck and both arms for intravenous
    needles. I also recall KT&rsquo;s Regina High School classmate and
    now Op-room nurse, Mary Driscoll, holding my hand and providing
    running banter on what was going on and what would happen next, and
    the camaraderie and jibes among technicians doing the ECG and like
    monitoring, and wiring hook-ups around my chest area.</p>
  <p class="western" style="page-break-before: auto">Finally I recall
    being moved from the holding or set-up area onto a bed of ice
    (literally, and they also chill your blood 9 degrees lower in the
    perfusion machine) under a battery of eight huge lamps and asking,
    &ldquo;Is dis de place?&rdquo; And everybody laughingly replying in
    unison, &ldquo;Dis is de place!&rdquo; At no time during any of the
    foregoing did I feel ANYTHING, thanks to the morphine and other
    stuff they were then able to tube into me. My last re collection was
    the anesthetist saying, &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re going to begin.&rdquo;</p>

    I told you I had a heart &ndash; June 03, 1981</h3>
  <p class="western">Naturally, there was no recollection of the
    introduction of the nose and trachea tubes, or insertion of the
    bladder catheter. In fact, the next thing I recall was striving
    mightily to focus my eyes on a down-peering and smiling Kathleen and
    Charlie in the ICU room, as Kathleen said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
    over, Dad,&rdquo; and Charlie chimed in, &ldquo;We all love you,
    Dad!&rdquo; It was a glorious moment. THANKS BE TO GOD! They tell me
    it was then 1700. The family had had a flash of me earlier (1550) as
    I was wheeled from the Op-room to the ICU, when (as they told me
    later) I was &ldquo;ice cold &ndash; looked like a real zombie &ndash;
    now I know what a blank stare really is!&rdquo; (Thanks, fellows, I
    really needed that!) They visited me again later, during normal ICU
    visiting hours of 1915&ndash;1945. I recall seeing both Kathy and Mo
    at these ICU visits too. It was hard to focus and, with the trachea
    tubes in place, impossible to talk. Charlie says I somehow formed
    the words, &ldquo;What time is it,&rdquo; and he replied &ldquo;7:30
    pm.&rdquo; He also says I fought to free his hand-holding so I could
    flash the old three-finger OK signal in response to their questions.
    It was frustrating, but it sure was great to see them and hear them.
    Charlie also recalls that I was still wild-eyed and jerky in my head
    movements, but had warmed up considerably and seemed markedly
    improved. There was no pain whatsoever. My trachea tubes were
    removed at 2330, at which time I&rsquo;d managed to re establish
    breathing on my own. (Of course, my heart had been stopped during
    the operation also, from between 45 minutes to an hour.) I was then
    able to manage a whisper to the superb one-on-one attending nurse.</p>
  <p class="western">This seems the proper time to introduce Mo&rsquo;s
    post operation recollections as recorded that very day:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I went to the hospital the afternoon of the
    operation and just missed you being rolled down to the ICU. When I
    finally saw you in the ICU about an hour later, you looked a lot
    slimmer than I had imagined you being. You had no covers on, and
    were dressed in only a short hospital gown. You also had a big white
    diaper-like thing wrapped around you. The first thing I thought of
    was how embarrassed you&rsquo;d be if you knew I&rsquo;d seen you
    with that on. I had to leave the room shortly after because I got
    all choked up. You looked so flustered and frustrated. You looked so
    poor and helpless, but I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking how amazing it
    was to see you looking so well. I guess I had expected the worst. At
    first I thought you were in a lot of pain. That breathing machine
    looked like it was hurting you. Your eyes seemed really glassy and
    just seemed to be floating around sort of aimlessly.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I guess I mistook frustration for hurt when
    I first came in. I felt as helpless as you to a point, because I
    couldn&rsquo;t do anything but hold your hand. But then you seemed
    to change after I got there. I couldn&rsquo;t say anything because I
    knew you couldn&rsquo;t reply, and I thought that would make you
    even more frustrated. You kept trying to look at me. I don&rsquo;t
    think you could place who I was, especially as I didn&rsquo;t speak
    up. But it did feel good to have you grasp my hand (even though your
    grasp really wasn&rsquo;t much). I&rsquo;d move my hand and you&rsquo;d
    try to twitch yours. It may have just been the drugs wearing off.
    You felt so cold, but I knew that was to be expected. You felt so
    cold and yet so warm &ndash; like for the first time <i>you</i>
    needed me instead of <i>me</i> needing you. The main thing I
    remember, though, was your frustrated glances at everyone. The
    second time we visited (about two hours later) you seemed so much
    more alert, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. That time you really took
    hold of my hand and wouldn&rsquo;t let go. I think it meant as much
    to me as it probably did to you. I&rsquo;m just glad it all went so
    well and that I could come and be there with you. [THANKS, Mo, for
    that tender recollection.]</p>

    My <i>best</i> medicine pulling me through</h3>
  <p class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">4 Jun</span></i>:
    It turned out that they (the hospital staff) needed a bed in the
    cardiac ICU at 0950, and so I was removed to a general ICU as &ldquo;the
    most improved/ stabilized.&rdquo; Well, that was <i>their</i> story.
    I&rsquo;d been given a fluid breakfast which I devoured (heretofore
    having had only two small servings of George&rsquo;s favorite ICU
    staple of ice chips), and enjoyed a regular menu lunch even though
    it was fried chicken (no favorite of mine) and &ldquo;real&rdquo;
    coffee. The whole day sped by like one at a country club. I was
    painless and spent most of the day fast asleep, with virtually no
    recollection of new visitors that day except for George and Pat.
    Aside from the visitors and meal times, I think I was just plain
    &ldquo;out of it&rdquo;! I do remember that by crooking my neck and
    looking over my left shoulder I could see a door that opened
    directly onto a roof-top helipad. I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking
    what a neat ringside view I&rsquo;d have of any poor soul they might
    have to wing into the hospital. It never occurred to me that I might
    be in the Trauma Unit, even though I was the only patient in the
    room and was continually attended by both an intern and a nurse. As
    I said, I wasn&rsquo;t too alert that day.</p>
  <p class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">5 Jun</span></i>:
    Early in the morning the storm finally broke. I went into violent
    200-cycle atrial fibrillation from 0414&ndash;0715 (not continuous,
    of course, just wildly erratic). The young black intern and a superb
    older Danish nurse then on duty applied beaucoup units of various
    things via the Heparin connection in my right wrist (this being a
    sort of valved inlet/outlet needled into an artery precisely to
    introduce or remove fluids in an emergency without having to zap you
    with new needles each time). Heparin, of course, is an anticoagulant
    derived from animal livers. They also gave me a shot of something in
    the right shoulder. And I had to drink three huge potassium
    cocktails (not tasty, but with apple juice it came out something
    like a cherry coke), in an effort, in effect, to restore a proper
    electrolytic balance in my heart&rsquo;s &ldquo;battery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">The doctor and nurse really worked over me
    frantically in those early morning hours, and I kept drifting in and
    out of consciousness, on the whole feeling comfortably euphoric.
    There was one dramatic period when I had a feeling of being outside
    of or completely removed from my body. I was sort of looking down,
    totally detached, on my own semi-slumbering self, and I couldn&rsquo;t
    figure out why that guy and gal were struggling over me so
    excitedly. I <i>was</i> somewhat concerned though, as I recall
    striving furiously to get their attention, in order to suggest that
    perhaps they might want to call in some more experienced specialist.
    But they never would look up to wherever I was hovering on the upper
    wall or ceiling. I guess you just, as the saying goes, had to be
    there. At length things just seemed to settle down and my next
    recollection was waking for breakfast. (I&rsquo;m sure that whenever
    I die I&rsquo;m certain to wake for breakfast that very next
    morning!) It was at that point that the now weary young intern (now
    off duty) returned to check up on me. He asked if there was anything
    he could do for me. I replied that he already had done plenty. He
    smiled broadly and then gratefully seized my hand and squeezed it.
    That was nice. I realized then that we had really shared a crisis
    together. Anyhow, by 1300 I was sufficiently recovered and
    stabilized to be removed to the regular cardiac ward. Once there, I
    did automatically touch off two &ldquo;beeper&rdquo; warnings of
    fibrillation via my chest monitor, at 1530 and 1800. That really
    brought people flying to my bedside, but they finally determined I
    had a defective plug-in and replaced it. Instant cure. My biggest
    problems from there on turned out to be stomach gas and a loud-
    mouthed, red-neck, good-old-boy roommate. Maybe there&rsquo;s some
    sort of redundancy in that last statement.<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote74anc" href="#sdendnote74sym"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
  <p class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">6&#8209;</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: normal">7&#8209;</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: normal">8
	Jun</span></i>: The Chaplain provided Holy Communion on the 7th. KT
    provided an Egg McMuffin and a Quarter-pounder on the 6th and 8th, I
    think it was. This, of course, is verboten heart-patient food, but I
    devoured it. This was also the period during which I became
    permanently attached to my <i>second</i> pillow. You have to cough a
    lot after surgery, to expel potentially infectious phlegm. Yet,
    every cough almost tears your now tender heart out. So, they issue a
    small pillow which you clutch tightly to your chest whenever you
    cough &ndash; or sneeze. But God forbid, you don&rsquo;t dare
    sneeze. You sense it would really explode your chest. (In fact, I
    didn&rsquo;t dare risk my first post-surgery sneeze until 12 Aug &ndash;
    some seventy days after surgery!) Anyhow, by now I was obviously
    well on the road to recovery, walking up and down the hall as often
    as possible to improve cardiovascular activity, and sniffing oxygen
    continuously when abed on the basis that it was free and couldn&rsquo;t
    hurt. Escape from my loud-mouthed roommate was all the incentive I
    needed to get back out into the hall and walk. I was ready to go
    home.</p>
  <p class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">9 Jun et
	seq</span></i>: I was released at 8 am on 9 Jun (6 days after the
    surgery). My exit instructions, courtesy of a pretty and very young
    nurse: Work up to walking at least a mile/day, following body
    signals. Avoid all lifting and arm pressure, like auto driving for
    4&ndash;6 weeks. Assume only a passive position for sex. (It was all
    I could do to refrain from asking this very serious young lady,
    &ldquo;Could you elaborate a little on what you mean by that?&rdquo;)
    It&rsquo;s OK to take short car rides as a passenger (which was a
    lucky thing, considering Greg was standing by even then to drive me
    home). Any diet was OK, but &ldquo;watch&rdquo; fats and salt (and I
    glance at them faithfully every time I see them on my plate until
    this very day). Keep practicing my deep breathing and coughing
    daily. That was it! I didn&rsquo;t even have to pass the cashier on
    the way out. Blue Cross covered the whole $13,388.03 (of which the
    surgeon&rsquo;s fee &ndash; covering all his assistants &ndash; was
    $3,750) &ndash; a real bargain! And so, I was home with a beer for
    lunch by 1030. One interesting footnote of this period might be that
    on 15&ndash;16 Jun I bottomed out at a mere 203 pounds, before
    beginning a gradual return to my more customary 225 level. At 1345
    on the 10th, a nun from St. Bernadette&rsquo;s brought me communion.
    Hilbert Unger visited later in the day. On 11 Jun Kathleen and I
    went to St. B&rsquo;s for a thanksgiving mass.</p>
  <p class="western">You may have noted that throughout the entire
    ordeal I was aware of no real pain. I neither asked for nor received
    any oral pain or sleep medicine at any time, though the same was
    always on constant offer. Of course I don&rsquo;t really know how
    much pain killer was introduced by needle, other than the initial
    morphine shot and some op-room shots prior to my big blackout. My
    chest scar was a precise surgical cut, extending from just below the
    throat to just above the navel, and never caused any trouble. I&rsquo;ll
    confess only to some slight but ever present chest tightness in
    those early convalescent days, which compelled be to constantly
    resist nodding forward, and kept me forcing my head up and shoulders
    back with chest thrust outward. After all, they had sawed through my
    breastbone, ratcheted the halves 10&quot; apart, and then had to
    muscle them back together by two men standing on opposite sides of
    me heaving mightily on stainless steel binding wires.</p>
  <p class="western">They drive these wires through the breastbone
    with a regular shoemaker&rsquo;s awl, and use an ordinary cafeteria
    spoon on the other side to preclude it piercing any adjoining
    tissue. When the doctors asked how I was feeling during one of my
    post-op visits, I told them about my chest discomfort. When they
    persisted, &ldquo;How does it feel?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;It
    feels like somebody might have left a teaspoon inside.&rdquo; They
    damn near died laughing, and wanted know how I knew about the
    teaspoon bit. (I had read it in a hospital newsletter in the waiting
    room.) Anyhow, an x-ray of my chest now discloses a sort of wire
    birdcage, plus four &ldquo;wedding rings&rdquo; that were slipped
    onto the bypasses to mark the mouths of the grafts at the aorta.</p>
  <p class="western">My leg scar was something else. I presume that
    everybody knows that they remove a substantial length of leg vein to
    use as the heart bypass veins. My 20&quot; leg scar extends from
    just inside the right leg crotch crease to halfway down the inside
    of the right calf. It is ugly and jagged, like the seam you get when
    you pull a long horizontally sprouting tree root up from the ground.
    Initially, it didn&rsquo;t bother me at all, either, until some 11
    days after the operation &ndash; some five days after I had been
    released from the hospital. What happened was that I went to Sunday
    Mass on 14 Jun, and on getting out of the car at home I was
    surprised to find my right pants leg soaking wet. I presumed amidst
    much embarrassment that I had unknowingly simply wet my pants.
    Examination proved otherwise. A hole about the diameter of a nickel,
    and one-quarter-inch deep (near the upper end of my leg scar) was
    suppurating a clear odorless liquid in rather copious quantities.
    This was a matter of some alarm only in that it was totally
    unexpected.</p>
  <p class="western">A call to the doctor revealed that this was not
    unusual, was nothing to worry about, and that it would in time heal
    of itself quite naturally. (Note that this was the ONLY omission in
    my otherwise outstanding pre-briefing.) Meanwhile, I was to keep
    compresses on it (and in fact I had to pin several thicknesses of
    heavy bath towel around it, and replace the towels frequently), and
    visit the doctor at least weekly until it stopped. Well, it ain&rsquo;t
    easy to get pants on over a towel, folks, and I made at least two
    office visits (&ldquo;Hmm &hellip; it&rsquo;s still leaking&hellip;&rdquo;)
    before it finally closed on 18 Jul, just in time for our 20&ndash;30
    Jul stint at Ocean City &ndash; where I was able to swim (47 days
    after the operation), but dared not dive. I had tried to expedite
    leg- healing by exposing the whole area to sunshine every afternoon
    in our backyard. It might not have helped much, but it sure felt
    good.</p>

    Post-op Ocean City therapy &ndash; July 1981</h3>
  <p class="western">Well, you might suppose that this would mark the
    end of the saga of the heart. WRONG! Now we would have to undergo
    another test to find out just how successful the bypass operation
    had been. Let&rsquo;s see now, what test have we not tried yet? Oh!
    There&rsquo;s as so-called thallium stress test. Why don&rsquo;t we
    try that one? And, of course we did. Now we&rsquo;ve made it into
    nuclear medicine, folks. For this one I spent a morning (5 Aug 81)
    in Holy Cross Hospital. For this drill, a small amount of the
    radioactive isotope thallium 201 is injected into an arm vein via
    our old friend, the Heparin fitting, at the very end of a treadmill
    test (two minutes <i>beyond</i> the time you yell that you can&rsquo;t
    go on!) In the immortal words of Gilda Radner, &ldquo;I THOUGHT ah
    wuz GONna DIE!&rdquo; Areas of the heart penetrated by the thallium
    become radioactive and can be visually projected on a CRT and also
    recorded by scintillation (gamma) camera photographs, and then
    repeated 3 hours later (with longer exposure due to dissipation of
    the &ldquo;dye&rdquo;). This process reveals whether &ldquo;blackout&rdquo;
    areas persist (indicating enduring scars) or have disappeared
    (indicating narrowed coronary arteries), and all manner of heart
    deficiencies or abnormal blood flow. The test is noninvasive,
    painless, quick, involves less radioactivity than a normal x-ray,
    and it as expensive as the devil. My heart rate went from 53 to 101
    to a recovery at 41. They said this was terrific.</p>
  <p class="western">By now I was beginning to feel somewhat like a
    guinea pig. The professionals would simply say, &ldquo;Do this!&rdquo;
    and you&rsquo;d do it, but you never could find out what they
    thought was wrong, what they expected to find out, or what the
    alternatives or even the implications were. (Much of the detail
    presented here is the result of private post-op research.) So,
    naturally, I penned a diatribe of sorts by way of venting my spleen.
    It seems appropriate to include it as this point:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Everyone knows the story about the donkey
    who could be made to do almost any chore, but first you had to bash
    it over the head with a two-by-four to get its attention. I suspect
    that even the most able physicians rank just below donkeys in this
    respect. As a group, the general competence and integrity of doctors
    must equal if not excel that of virtually all other professionals.
    Still, as articulators of their admitted expertise they fall right
    in there with good Pope John Paul II, who, while proficient in
    several dozen languages, can apparently communicate in none.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The doctors, of course, might plead that
    for them to waste time trying to explain the intricacies of various
    debilities to mere laymen would be tantamount to having Einstein
    explain the finer points of quantum physics to an English
    kindergarten &ndash; in German. There are, in other words, the dual
    difficulties of an arcane art and violently varying vocabularies to
    be considered. In fact, this ploy is little more than a cop-out. Few
    patients are interested in the nitty-gritty of, say, histoplasmosis
    or sporotrichosis, or being coached in do-it-yourself surgery.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">What they <i>do</i> want to know in advance
    is what they will be feeling and seeing, what they will and won&rsquo;t
    be able to do, what the range of probable outcomes might be, what
    alternatives there may be, and, most of all, what they can do
    <i>themselves</i> to mitigate the deficiency, facilitate the
    convalescence, and preclude recurrences or further deterioration.
    After all, the bodies concerned are their own, and they&rsquo;re the
    ones who have to live (or die) with them &ndash; and they abhor
    avoidable surprises!</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Perhaps nowhere is the divergence between
    the supply and demand of relevant information greater than in the
    post-operative period following coronary bypass surgery. The latter
    is a very popular (with surgeons) procedure in which a section of a
    vein from a limb of the body is removed and then regrafted around a
    blocked stretch of a coronary artery. (Did I neglect to mention that
    this entails the chest being slit and the breastbone being sawed
    through and then pried some 10&quot; apart, and that in the process
    your heart is actually stopped? Details, details! Not to worry.
    This, too, shall pass.) Generally everything goes well, and almost
    before you can say &ldquo;Blue Cross&rdquo; you&rsquo;re feeling
    pretty good and are back on the job.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Of course you have to <i>monitor</i> your
    life-style fairly closely after this, and you visit your
    cardiologist periodically. Then, one day it suddenly dawns on you
    that that is all your cardiologist is doing too &ndash; monitoring.
    You get feeling good over the fact that your quarterly check-ups
    confirm that everything is A-OK, but then you realize that the whole
    business, from start to never-quite-finished, is merely a palliative
    process. The situation has been eased, but no cure has been
    initiated. Think about it. A vein has been taken from your leg
    (which was never tops on your blood circulation list), and has been
    installed to improve the blood flow to your heart. And the same
    process that has always been at work clogging up your original
    coronary veins is now just as merrily &ldquo;doing its thing&rdquo;
    on the already &ldquo;used&rdquo; replacement vein!</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Maybe we haven&rsquo;t started to worry
    yet, but we do start to think and that soon leads us to seek further
    information. It is precisely here that we confront the heart (pun
    intended) of the problem. By and large our extremely competent
    physicians meet our serious queries with a benign pabulum the like
    of which teaching nuns customarily used to feed the parents of young
    Catholic school children. Let&rsquo;s label this the &ldquo;tut-tut,
    my dear&rdquo; syndrome (TTMD).</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Now I submit that any layman might
    reasonable conclude that the adaption of a bypass &ldquo;pipe&rdquo;
    clearly concedes that the bypassed pipe was blocked to some
    unacceptable degree. (Of course it could rather have been leaking,
    but not in the case here posited.) Now, the original pipe
    (prescinding from the possibility of congenital abnormality) was not
    always blocked. So, the question arises as to whence the blockage.
    This unhappy little process is termed atherosclerosis, and has to do
    with the adhesion of soft fatty deposits on the inside walls of our
    veins that begin with birth. If anyone knows the root cause of this
    process, they&rsquo;re not talking. In fact, when you get to asking
    what causes it, can you prevent it, slow it down, or reverse it,
    resort is readily had to medical jargon which is supposed to convey
    the notion that the answer is beyond our ken (TTMD). Such
    representations might more legitimately be translated as, &ldquo;We
    don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; but don&rsquo;t ever expect to hear that
    from your doctor.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Well, that&rsquo;s perfectly all right!
    There are lots of things we don&rsquo;t know, but our American
    tradition has always been &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s
    what research is all about. This approach suggests a vast array of
    new questions. The first one might be: What elements of input (food
    and drink) are factors in the generation of these unwanted fatty
    deposits? Surely the accretion of deposits must in some manner stem
    from the new material ingested into our bodies. Can we not identify,
    isolate, and avoid these injurious elements or the deadly
    combination of several elements which interact with such dangerous
    effect? &ldquo;If our biochemist can develop Tang to sustain us en
    route to the moon, then why can&rsquo;t we&hellip;?</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Analogies that come to mind are the
    diabetic&rsquo;s strictures against sugar and the heart patient&rsquo;s
    strictures against salt. <i>Who</i> is doing <i>what</i> in this
    area with respect to the dietary elements generating these unwelcome
    fatty deposits? To the extent doctors deign to address diet at all,
    it is largely directed at denigrating diet &ldquo;cures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Again, what&rsquo;s being done to test the
    feasibility of &ldquo;coating&rdquo; veins early on in life with a
    protective shield that might resist the adherence of these fatty
    deposits which too soon clog up our veins? Analogies that spring to
    mind range from Fluoride to Teflon. To be sure, such a development
    and testing program would take years to conduct and evaluate. The
    question remains: is any such project even underway?</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Finally, if we can&rsquo;t beat the problem
    by avoiding ingestion of the damaging agent(s) nor preclude
    adherence of unwanted substances by pre-coating the insides of our
    precious pipes, then why can&rsquo;t we develop a solution for
    periodically flushing out our system? The analogy of Drano for the
    kitchen sink drain comes to mind, or the way salt-to-fresh-water
    evaporator tubes are periodically flushed free of scale by muriatic
    acid in sea-going ships.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Now I confess that I&rsquo;m not yet quite
    ready to inhale a muriatic acid cocktail, but I have personally
    experienced the effectiveness of downing multiple potassium
    cocktails to restore a proper electrolytic balance following open
    heart surgery. I mean, that general approach has possibilities.
    Certainly there must be some element or compound in our chemical
    arsenal which can safely dissolve and flush out these fatty
    deposits. Only recently some ingested medicine solution for
    dissolving gallstones has been introduced. What allied effort is now
    underway for solving atherosclerosis?</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I suspect that the answer to all the
    foregoing questions might well be that significant efforts are
    underway in all the areas cited, and more, but that vastly extended
    periods of trial and verification must be endured before any
    favorable development might safely be prescribed for general public
    use. If so, then we encounter a double standard here. After all, the
    first successful coronary bypass was accomplished as recently as
    1962, and only about 2500 had been done world wide by 1970. Yet, by
    1980 fifty-to-seventy thousand were being done per year in this
    county alone. But as recently as 1980 a joint Public Health
    Service/National Institutes of Health publication admitted that
    &ldquo;clinical investigations are now trying to determine whether
    bypass surgery improves or impairs heart function, and whether it
    increases a patient&rsquo;s life expectancy.&rdquo; Get that! In the
    immortal words of Laurence Welk, &ldquo;Wonerful!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="quote-western">It would seem that the surgeons didn&rsquo;t
    hesitate to push the coronary bypass operation long before its value
    was clearly established. Why, then, the big delay in implementing
    any promising-looking developments with regard to less traumatic
    alternatives? Why don&rsquo;t the medical professionals at least
    give those in a &ldquo;bypass situation&rdquo; some hint of what
    might be expected in the reasonably near future, and what these
    folks might be doing in the interim to help themselves? Most of us
    would prefer to hear the doctors say, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
    or &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; rather than persisting in the
    dignity-affronting TTMD. All right! I know, I know. That would
    invite even more of those frivolous negligence suits which have
    already blasted medical costs into orbit. Just understand that heart
    patients, above all others, must simply get such things (sorry about
    that!) <i>off their chests</i>.</p>
  <p class="western">Actually, of course, I don&rsquo;t really have
    anything much to complain about. All my luck has been uniformly good
    &ndash; especially on all the important things in life: when and
    where I was born, my race, my parents, my faith, my educational
    opportunities, my surviving The Big War, my securing a superb wife,
    our welcoming nine whole-bodied, wholesome-minded children and one
    tiny saint, my professional success, and for upwards of three score
    years, really &ndash; my good health. This brings to mind columnist
    William Rusher who recently published this medical rule of thumb:
    &ldquo;In your 30&rsquo;s nothing will happen; in your 40&rsquo;s
    nothing <i>should</i> happen; in your 50&rsquo;s something may
    happen; in your 60&rsquo;s something <i>will</i> happen!&rdquo;
    Well, that&rsquo;s been just about my experience. The bypass bit
    came at age 63. Rusher, however, then elaborates further insights
    with which I totally agree:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Sixty years of largely exuberant health is
    all anyone has a reason to expect &hellip; [and] if this account of
    what Winston Churchill called &ldquo;the surly advance of
    decrepitude&rdquo; has sounded a little gloomy up to now, let me
    give you the good news. With age, and only with age, come several
    good things. Perspective, for one. A person of 30 or 40 simply
    hasn&rsquo;t been around long enough to see how events repeat
    themselves, how lines that seemed parallel gradually converge, how
    time heals.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">At the same time, a person over 60 has a
    new (and healthy) awareness of his own mortality that alters his
    attitude toward many things. For example, the old saying that &ldquo;you
    can&rsquo;t take it with you,&rdquo; which has been familiar to the
    point of banality all of one&rsquo;s life, now suddenly becomes a
    fresh and piercingly accurate insight into certain important
    limitations on the nature of money, and indeed of all property&hellip;
    Values, in one&rsquo;s later years, are quite likely therefore to
    change spectacularly &ndash; and usually for the better.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Even courage to face life&rsquo;s disasters
    becomes a bit easier. If a tyrant were to threaten me with execution
    (let alone &ldquo;life imprisonment&rdquo;), I think I could defy
    him more bravely now than I might have been able to do 30 or 40
    years ago. The ability of others to do me harm is severely limited
    these days, and to that extent age has actually increased my
    freedom.</p>
  <p class="western">Rusher is <i>so</i> right! Already I have come to
    appreciate that property &ndash; <i>any</i> property &ndash; is a
    stern warden which grievously circumscribes one&rsquo;s freedom. You
    have to stay with it, watch over it, protect it, insure it, maintain
    it, and worry about it. Property makes one a prisoner. As for
    personal safety or security, I rather imagine that I might well
    react to any threat on my life with Clint Eastwood&rsquo;s great
    movie line, &ldquo;Go ahead! Make my day!&rdquo; There gradually
    comes a recognition that you&rsquo;ve been everywhere and done just
    about everything you would ever reasonably hope to do, or that
    you&rsquo;ve now lost the physical energy or mental inclination to
    even undertake whatever remains on your &ldquo;wish list.&rdquo; You
    realize that you&rsquo;re ready &ndash; the good Lord willing, of
    course &ndash; to move on. There&rsquo;s simply not as much gusto
    the second or third time around. The party&rsquo;s over, it&rsquo;s
    time to get on with the cleaning up &ndash; readying the soul to
    meet God.</p>
  <p class="western">Speaking of cleaning up, it&rsquo;s high time we
    cleaned up this heart-rending (literally) saga. No doubt I&rsquo;ve
    rambled on overlong on this heart business, telling one and all much
    more than they ever cared to know. I propose two excuses: (1) it <i>is</i>
    a major event in my life, and (2) it <i>could</i> be of major
    interest to any of my progeny unfortunate enough eventually to
    confront a similar congenital affliction. Accordingly, I shall
    persist (as briefly as possible, I promise) in the documentation of
    this case history to date. Only three incidents remain to be
    reported. The first occurred on 17 Feb 84, two years and eight
    months after the eminently successful bypass job. I can&rsquo;t
    cover it better (or easier) than by incorporating a 14 Mar 84 letter
    to Sr. Kathleen:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">HEALTH UPDATE: The good news is that it&rsquo;s
    pretty damn good. The bad news was, that we just found this out
    Friday after a spell of real worry. It all began on 17 Feb. I was
    quietly working at my computer that morning when I suddenly was
    blasted by a rather good (that is, BAD) chest pain. This was the
    first I&rsquo;d had since my bypass, and I&rsquo;d forgotten how bad
    they could be. Worse than that, it persisted longer than I had ever
    had one before. I finally subdued it after 2 nitro pills. (If you
    take a 3rd, which is permissible, and it still persists, then you&rsquo;re
    supposed to rush to the nearest hospital. Naturally, I&rsquo;ve
    always resisted a 3rd pill, so far!)</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Well, the worst thing about it all was the
    TERRIBLE depression that ensued. You see, you go along thinking
    you&rsquo;ve got it licked, and all of a sudden you find yourself
    back where you started, and you didn&rsquo;t even get to pass go and
    collect $200! Then the payoff came on 8 Mar, when I reported to my
    cardiologist for my regular quarterly check-up. All was going well
    until I told him about the foregoing experience. That immediately
    triggered an ECG (which showed unexpected serious deterioration
    since the previous one), and a series of chest x-rays (where for the
    first time I got to see the 4 &ldquo;wedding rings&rdquo; installed
    by the surgeon to mark my bypasses, and the birdcage of wires used
    to strap my chest bone back together after they had sawed it apart
    to get to my heart.) Really neat! But, believe me, it&rsquo;s often
    felt just like it looked &ndash; like a birdcage had been stuffed
    inside my chest before they sewed me back up. These checks led him
    to schedule me for a stress test on the following day, Friday, 9
    Mar.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Well, this was the start of &ldquo;The Big
    <i>Non</i>-Sleep!&rdquo; Nobody had to tell me that if I failed
    that, then I&rsquo;d be scheduled for another angiogram (where they
    squirrel that 1/10&quot; tube up through a vein inside your thigh
    right into your heart, inject dye, and then photograph the blood
    flow through the heart). It&rsquo;s just not a fun thing, you know.
    And, of course, failing could mean more by pass surgery. Really!
    They <i>do</i> do &ldquo;instant replays.&rdquo; I definitely didn&rsquo;t
    think that would be a fun thing! You can&rsquo;t believe how I
    agonized through that Thursday night!</p>
  <p class="quote-western">But back to the good news. I demolished
    that &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; test! In fact, when the doctor told me I
    had a minute to go, I actually turned on a finishing kick like track
    stars do. I mean, I was really going all out to beat that stress
    business. To make a long story longer, my pressure started at 130/80
    (which is great, of course, but don&rsquo;t forget I&rsquo;ve been
    being highly medicated for high blood pressure for years), worked it
    up to 205/90, and it settled back down to 130/60 (60 is unbelievably
    great!) within one minute &ndash; indicating great recovery
    capacity. In short, I passed. I was so relieved &ndash; I HAVEN&rsquo;T
    FELT THAT GREAT IN 20 YEARS!</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The hardest strain on me during the test
    was the strain in the knees &ndash; NOT the chest, and luckily for
    the past 3&ndash;4 months, I&rsquo;ve been going up and down 100
    stairs to build up my cardiovascular system before each of my three
    meals per day. I&rsquo;m certain in retrospect that my knees would
    never have made it without that conditioning. It was Kathleen&rsquo;s
    idea, and I adopted it because I found it got my pulse up to the
    desired exercise level much more quickly than riding the exercise
    bike.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">So, the doctor said I must have experienced
    some kind of a &ldquo;quirk&rdquo;! (How&rsquo;s that for a truly
    professional opinion, folks?) He added that while my ECG showed
    definite deterioration since the immediately preceding one, that the
    effects of the change were evidently minor, and I didn&rsquo;t
    appear to be in any near term risk of a heart attack &hellip;
    (S&#8209;L&#8209;U&#8209;M&#8209;P&#8209;!) &hellip; Anyhow, I&rsquo;m
    to just continue what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">How bad was it all? It was seven hundred
    and seventeen dollars worth of bad &ndash; the stress test being
    performed while under simultaneous and continuous nuclear scan. The
    latter entailed three shots, to set up the radioactive isotope dye.
    The girl took three punctures to find the vein the first time, and
    five punctures for the second shot. She hit it the first time on the
    third shot, compelling me to remark, &ldquo;You see, practice <i>does</i>
    make perfect!&rdquo; Well, I sure can&rsquo;t find any fault with
    the overall results. Thanks be to God.</p>
  <p class="western">Now I was on Easy Street, right? <i>WRONG!</i> It
    was only eight months later that I was suddenly stricken again. At
    least this time I had some excuse &ndash; Mo was getting married. I
    thought everything was under control. I thought I was Mr. Cool, but
    on a necessary special visit to my cardiologist he said, &ldquo;Well,
    your heart is telling you you&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; He went on to
    explain that the heart can&rsquo;t tell the difference between
    excitement and exercise and went on to prescribe some additional
    medication. Apparently, I was very excited. I had had to start
    taking an occasional nitro pill the week preceding the wedding of 25
    Nov 84, but as the late Ed Sullivan might have put it, &ldquo;The
    really, really BIG show&rdquo; hit me on 6&ndash;10 Dec. I even
    missed Mass on the feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 Dec.</p>
  <p class="western">In fact, I almost missed 8 Dec itself &ndash; and
    all days beyond! It actually started precisely at 2000 on Thursday
    evening, 6 Dec 84. I <i>know</i>, because when you start taking
    nitro pills, old Navy types start keeping a log. This was my first
    angina attack since my medication had been changed and increased,
    and it struck in a period of rest without any apparent provoking
    cause. Worse yet, the attacks recurred whenever I tried to lie down.
    Solution: I spent the night sitting in one of those adjustable
    lounge chairs. I also continued occasional nitros through the night
    and during the forenoon of Friday. With (as <i>always</i> seems to
    be the case) a doctor-less weekend in prospect (and my doctor being
    a totally orthodox Jew), I gave my cardiologist a call. Once again,
    he in creased my medication (now 400%&acute; greater than the
    original dosage!) and the afternoon went smoothly. The Sabbath
    officially starts for the orthodox at sunset on Friday evening. This
    turns out to be at 1638 on 7 Dec at our latitude and longitude. My
    first biggie struck at 1700 on 7 Dec (truly, the <i>day that will
      live in infamy</i>). My doctor was inaccessible. Sure, there are
    standbys, but they don&rsquo;t have my records and don&rsquo;t know
    my history. Also, they not only aren&rsquo;t as interested in my
    welfare as my doctor, they actually seem afraid to say or do
    anything beyond stall you with less than reassuring platitudes. I
    know! I&rsquo;d been that route before. I knew the only resource I
    had available beyond self-help was the Emergency Room at Holy Cross
    Hospital &ndash; not a happy prospect at all! And so the nitro
    parade (like none I&rsquo;d ever had before) began: 1700; 1824 and
    1829; 1921 (retiring for another l o n g night in the lounge chair);
    2021; 2200 (cutting back slightly on one of my medicines, figuring
    the increase sure hadn&rsquo;t helped); 2225; 0013 (now into
    Saturday, 8 Dec, and it didn&rsquo;t slip my mind that my Mom had
    died on a 9 Dec); 0130; 0245 and 0251. Hey! This was getting really
    scary. I&rsquo;d never had to take more than two or, at most
    (without at least an hour gap), over any extended series of attacks,
    and I was totally unable to lie down even for a second. What to do?
    I had to think &ndash; think &ndash; think!</p>
  <p class="western">The usual and generally effective engineering
    approach is: what has been <i>changed</i> since all was going well?
    The answer: <i>medication</i>. I had added one new medicine, which I
    had already cut back on at 2200. I had also switched the form of
    another medicine and then had it doubled. I analyzed the nature of
    this switch. It was from 20-mg pills four times a day to a 160 mg of
    a so-called &ldquo;long-acting&rdquo; capsule once a day, an
    apparent doubling of the dosage. Increasing the dosage made sense to
    me. I began questioning the effectiveness of the long-acting aspect,
    and a general warning label re the medicine came back to me: &ldquo;In
    patients with angina pectoris, there have been reports of
    exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction
    (heart attack) following abrupt discontinuance of Inderal therapy.
    Therefore &hellip; dosage should be <i>gradually reduced</i> and the
    patient <i>carefully monitored</i>.&rdquo; Two things then occurred
    to me: maybe the relative strengths of the pills and the capsules
    were not a one-to-one proposition, and perhaps the capsules weren&rsquo;t
    as &ldquo;long-acting&rdquo; as supposed!</p>
  <p class="western">My conclusion was that the impact of the capsules
    was neither as strong nor as enduring as represented, and that I was
    effectively suffering from too abrupt a withdrawal from the
    medication. I was in a position to test this, as I still had some
    20-mg pills, and my last capsule had been taken the previous 10 am,
    and another wasn&rsquo;t due until the following 10 am. It was then
    0335, and I opted to take two &ldquo;supplementary&rdquo; 20-mg
    pills. At 0345 I had to take another nitro. At 0400 a dose of my
    other medication, Cardizem, a calcium blocker, was due. This is the
    one I had earlier cut back on, and I decided to split the difference
    between the original dose and the amount to which I had cut back.
    This was when I <i>really</i> was almost laid low, if not away.</p>
  <p class="western">From 0400 to 0410 I was stricken with the <i>worst</i>
    pain <i>ever</i> (one necessarily learns to time these attacks,
    because duration is ONE of the ways to distinguish angina from heart
    attack). At the same time other goodies were added: I started to
    sweat profusely, and (according to Kathleen) turned deathly white.
    As for me, I thought I was also going to throw up, and was seized
    with a sense of impending doom. I struggled to dress for a trip to
    the Emergency Room. Then, there was a sudden complete subsidence of
    all the adverse symptoms described above &ndash; my most complete
    relief in 24 hours &ndash; and I lapsed into sleep for the first
    time that night, for TWO hours &ndash; LYING DOWN! On awaking, still
    feeling relieved, I began my mental post-mortem. I concluded I had
    been on the very verge of a heart attack. I also calculated that the
    0410 relief coincided with just about the time the 0335 Inderal
    supplement would be &ldquo;peaking.&rdquo; I truly feel (and nobody
    will ever convince me differently) that I had in effect saved my own
    life by timely and correct medicinal adjustments. In fact, I stayed
    on the pills thereafter until I got to see the doctor early Monday
    morning (taking only three additional well scattered nitros over the
    51 hour interim). The doctor hardly responded to my abbreviated
    recital of the foregoing. (How could he without unnecessary risk?)
    After the customary ECG and chest listening and thumping he merely
    said, &ldquo;Stay with your current medication, it seems to be
    working.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">This was the program of pills <i>I</i> had worked
    out, but I objected: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a whole bottle of those
    super-expensive new capsules!&rdquo; So he said, &ldquo;OK. Then
    take two of them a day instead of one.&rdquo; I stood vindicated on
    my not-so-long-acting suspicion. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I objected, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
    then be taking 320 mg per day vs. my old 80 per day. That would be a
    400% increase!&rdquo; <i>Then</i>, and only then, he told me that
    the pill and capsule strengths were NOT on a one-to-one basis (the
    capsule being 60&ndash;65% the strength of the equivalent mg pill!).
    Vindicated again! I elaborate all this to emphasize that you can&rsquo;t
    depend on the doctors to tell you all you should know about the
    medicines they prescribe, and we wouldn&rsquo;t even know the right
    questions to ask. It behooves the patients to read all they can
    about their medicines! It may save their lives! At the same time,
    the doctor must learn all he can about his patient. We both knew
    something had happened, but we really didn&rsquo;t know what. He
    would have to find out, so &hellip; once again I was scheduled for
    an angiogram, this time at the Adventist Hospital in Takoma Park.
    This was accomplished 6&ndash;8 Jan 85. Needless to say, I didn&rsquo;t
    exert myself too much over the period of 10 Dec to 6 Jan.</p>
  <p class="western">The test went smoothly, but the efficiency of the
    Adventist Hospital can&rsquo;t compare with the Washington Hospital
    Center for ease of admission and discharge. In fact, I strongly
    believe that every doctor and nurse should be made to go through
    these in/out procedures once a year. You can bet they would
    streamline them in a hurry. Yet another interesting aspect of this
    sojourn was the fact of a <i>Catholic</i> being operated on by a <i>Jew</i>
    in a <i>Seventh Day Adventist</i> hospital &ndash; a truly
    ecumenical event. In any case, all went well, and the prognosis was
    as favorable as anyone could have reasonably hoped. The lower right
    corner of my heart (to which they had been unable to apply the
    planned fifth bypass in 1981) was now totally deteriorated &ndash;
    effectively dead. If they couldn&rsquo;t help it in 1981, they sure
    couldn&rsquo;t do anything for it now. Second, there was some
    occlusion of the anterior coronary artery which was not susceptible
    to angioplasty (the use of a catheter-introduced balloon to expand
    the occluded passage). In short, no further surgery was indicated.
    What I&rsquo;d have to do is adjust my life-style to an even less
    active regimen (if such were indeed possible). What they&rsquo;d try
    to do is deal with the situation through the adjusted medication.
    Well, all of this was fine with me. I&rsquo;ve accepted the fact
    that I&rsquo;m wearing out, and I never did want to live to be 100,
    or 90, or even 80. I&rsquo;ve done and said about everything I could
    hope to do or want to say. (Certainly you&rsquo;d have to agree that
    this book leaves very little unsaid.)</p>
  <p class="western">Let me just inject one postscript before moving
    on, for the benefit of any family members who might follow after me.
    Here is the bypass situation as of a 19 Jan 85 report in the <i>St.
      Petersburg Times</i> of an American Heart Association conference in
    Clearwater Beach, FL:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The National Center for Health Statistics
    reports that bypasses have increased from 159,000 in 1981 to
    200,000+ in 1984 at an average cost (1983) of $19,985; the operation
    does <i>not</i> cure patients, it does <i>not</i> cure coronary
    artery disease; a National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Study
    (1983) found that surgery didn&rsquo;t prolong life, and one
    therefore &ldquo;can put off bypass surgery until the pain gets so
    bad that nothing else helps,&rdquo; and that another reason for
    delaying surgery is that second bypass operations typically aren&rsquo;t
    as successful as the first. A recent Canadian study found that 10
    years after a bypass, veins became completely blocked in 30% of the
    cases and were clean in only 40% [mine were clean at the 3-1/2 year
    mark!].</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Because bypasses may not last a lifetime,
    consideration should be given to angioplasty (the
    catheter-introduced balloon process that has proven 69% effective on
    total blockages and 89% effective on 75&ndash;95% blockages, but
    which close abruptly/dangerously in 3% of the cases and re-narrow
    within 6 months in 20% of the cases per the Sep 84 Research
    Resources Reporter of the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services.
    There is roughly a 2% chance of dying on the table [but at the point

  <p class="western">Doctors at the conference also confessed that
    they started doing the operation in the 1960s <i>before</i> there
    was proof that it worked. &ldquo;They were acting on their beliefs,
    but not on scientific knowledge.&rdquo; Nor is that all. It turns
    out that &ldquo;beta blockers&rdquo; (<i>Inderol</i><span style="font-style: normal">)

      XXII. ANNIVERSARY</h2>

  <p class="chapter-quote-western">The holiest of all holidays are
    those kept by ourselves in silence and apart; the secret
    anniversaries of the heart.<span style="font-style: normal">
	&ndash;&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Longfellow</span></p>
  <p class="western">We now resume the regular chronology of our story
    in late Jun 81. On the 28th I lost my special nurse, waitress, and
    cocktail hostess. Laurie left Kinross as her home to join her
    mother, now Lt. Mary Wright, USAF, in Denver, CO. Part of my already
    deficient heart went with her. (Maybe <i>that</i>&rsquo;s what &ldquo;did
    in&rdquo; that lower right corner!?!) An excerpt of a 28 Sep letter
    of mine to Laurie seems pertinent:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I see by the old calendar on the wall that
    you have been gone from here (Kinross) three months today! By now
    you&rsquo;re into a whole new sort of life: new family of your own,
    new home, new school, new town, new friends, and new church. How
    exciting it all must be! And, you STILL have this old home, and an
    older Grammy and Papa! So, you have lots of <i>new</i>, and haven&rsquo;t
    lost any of the <i>old</i>. I think that&rsquo;s a pretty neat deal.
    Oh, we still have a few items around that remind us every day of the
    many happy years we were together &ndash; like your organ in the
    playroom, and your little make-up bench in your old bedroom. Every
    time I see that little table I almost get a tear in my eye, because
    I know that LITTLE girl is gone &ndash; forever. I&rsquo;ll bet
    you&rsquo;ve grown so much that your knees wouldn&rsquo;t even fit
    under it anymore.</p>
  <p class="western">Who <i>was</i> this little girl who left us? I
    have one of her school papers from that period that summarizes her
    &ldquo;favorite things&rdquo;: color &ndash; violet; pet &ndash; cat
    (cat?); ice cream &ndash; chocolite [sic]; sport &ndash; baseball;
    game &ndash; kick the can; day of the week &ndash; Saturday; place
    to visit &ndash; Grandma&rsquo;s (Ma&rsquo;s?); holiday &ndash;
    Easter [good theology, that]; thing to wear &ndash; first communion
    dress; restaurant &ndash; Red Lobster; food &ndash; shrimp; school
    subject &ndash; reading; thing I own &ndash; ring; song &ndash; One
    Wide River to Cross. Well, that might provide a good benchmark of
    her early likes for checking against later in life, but it doesn&rsquo;t
    begin to describe the delightful little human being who enkindled so
    much love and brightened our house and our lives for so many years.</p>
  <p class="western">I realize that this may well strike some as
    nostalgic and even sentimental trivia, but I introduce it to make
    two possibly totally overlooked points: after so many years,
    Laurie&rsquo;s leaving Kinross was perhaps more traumatic to
    Kathleen and me than to anybody else involved, and, more personally,
    I should be indulged some scintilla of favoritism in her behalf &ndash;
    she was the <i>only</i> child (my then being retired) I felt I had
    any real hand in raising. So, if it turns out I didn&rsquo;t use my
    hand enough, what are Grandparents for but to spoil grandchildren
    like they never would their own! I&rsquo;d buggy her with me to the
    bank, the Safeway, the Post Office, and even to the county liquor
    store. While I worked for Fr. Burke (3 years), I&rsquo;d even strap
    her in the front seat and take her there with me. Naturally, I
    missed her much. I only hope that someday she may discover that I
    was as important to her life as she was to mine.</p>
  <p class="western">In Aug of 1981 Laurie enjoyed a fabulous trip
    through that showplace of natural wonders on the eastern side of the
    Rockies with Mary and Bill. (This was perhaps one of Laurie&rsquo;s
    biggest adventures apart from Maureen having taken her to Florida to
    visit Moni the previous summer.) Their pictures were so good that
    now we won&rsquo;t have to make that great trip.</p>
  <p class="western">Meanwhile Voyager II, which had been launched in
    1977, sped by Saturn even as President Reagan launched PATCO&rsquo;s
    recalcitrant air-controllers into the ranks of the unemployed. (Was
    all this really so seemingly long ago?) In Sep Reagan appointed the
    first woman to the Supreme Court, and John hosted one of his great
    Labor Day picnics at Jug Bay. We&rsquo;ll ALL miss those. At the
    same time, and on a more somber note, my mother&rsquo;s health
    started deteriorating at an accelerated rate. On 21 Sep 81 she went
    into congestive heart failure, but at my request was not rushed to
    the hospital. For one thing, extraordinary measures didn&rsquo;t
    seem appropriate, and I didn&rsquo;t want her to become the pin
    cushion and expense account for a bunch of pioneering young interns.
    For another, I thought the presence of her immediate family members,
    as allowed by the looser discipline of the Nursing Home, would do
    her more good than any doctors could. A letter I wrote to Laurie at
    the time elaborates:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Remember Grammy especially in your prayers
    as we think she may be dying. She went into congestive heart failure
    a week ago today. I don&rsquo;t know how she really hangs on. She
    can hardly breathe and has been on oxygen all week now, and hardly
    eats anything. She&rsquo;s weak as a bird and hurts all over. It
    hurts her even to breathe. Still, every now and then I can make her
    laugh. Mostly, though, I just sit by her bed and hold her hand, and
    give her little sips of ice water. I know the sight of you would
    really cheer her up. You were always her favorite medicine &ndash;
    as you were for me when I came home from the hospital. (Remember, as
    my Special Waitress you even stopped taking tips!) Remember, too,
    how you&rsquo;d pull off my elastic stockings, and bring me cotton
    balls to wipe down my scars with hydrogen peroxide? My chest still
    is a little sore sometimes, but none of the old pains, and now I can
    almost do anything once again, and I know your prayers helped all
    that. So, please pray especially hard now for Grammy.</p>
  <p class="western">Of course, as anyone who ever witnessed my
    mother&rsquo;s fighting heart might have expected, she&rsquo;d
    survive this threat and live to fight again another day. The final
    battle came in early Dec. My Dear All letter of 10 Dec 81 may sum it
    up best:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I feel impelled to mark my mother&rsquo;s
    passing last night with this special note. Let me say right off that
    I&rsquo;m thrilled and overwhelmed by joy that she has at long last
    found that eternal peace that only God can grant. I&rsquo;m truly
    excited vicariously to share in the happy prospect that she now
    knows HIM, the Author of it all! I hesitate only slightly to remark
    that there is a slight touch of envy in me &ndash; she is now really
    HOME!</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Secondly, I must remark that she was a real
    fighter to the very end &ndash; with more heart in her than Muhammad
    Ali had on his best night! And too, in her strange way, strange in
    that she had often been quite abrasive, she was overflowing with
    love. She touched me viscerally in her declining days with her
    unabashed confessions of love for her husband (for whom she often
    mistook me) and ALL of her children. If any of you ever find
    yourselves battling against odds and refuse to give up, you can
    thank your paternal grandmother &ndash; because she was the real
    source. I marvel now at the fantastic parlay of my father&rsquo;s
    patience (which I don&rsquo;t have) and my mother&rsquo;s
    determination which (to some extent) I share.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">As I sat by mother&rsquo;s side often, if
    not long, in her last days, I must confess to a morbid interest in
    capturing her &ldquo;last words,&rdquo; but alas, I not only was not
    with her when she died, I didn&rsquo;t even see her on her last day.
    Kathleen and I took turns (since Mom had so often survived so many
    of these threats), and so Kathleen was the last to see her &ndash;
    and Mom wasn&rsquo;t talking by then. A few days earlier she had
    spent the entire day endlessly repeating aloud, &ldquo;Holy Mother
    of God, pray for me.&rdquo; After that day she spoke not another
    syllable, but lapsed into silent serenity.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">She didn&rsquo;t appear to be even aware of
    us near the end. As best I can recall, her last words to me took the
    following form: (Me) &ldquo;Are you warm enough?&rdquo;; (Her:
    affirmative nod); (Me) &ldquo;Do you know I love you?&rdquo;; (Her,
    speaking for the first time in several visits): &ldquo;Yes. Do you
    know I love you?&rdquo;; (Me) &ldquo;Yes. And do you know how much
    I&rsquo;m praying for you?&rdquo; (Her, nodding affirmatively and
    again speaking): &ldquo;And I never stop praying for you!&rdquo;
    <i>That was the last thing I ever heard her say</i> &ndash; and now
    she&rsquo;s praying for all of us &ndash; <i>up there</i>!</p>
  <p class="quote-western">In her last weeks I&rsquo;d been praying
    hard to the Sacred Heart via the Immaculate Heart, and was just
    brimming with suggestions &ndash; as though trying to make sure the
    Lord would get mother&rsquo;s demise <i>right</i>. The day she died,
    beginning with the second decade of the rosary I&rsquo;d been saying
    for her while I did my daily biking exercise (after saying the first
    decade in my customary vein of, &ldquo;Lord, it sure would be nice
    if you would &hellip;,&rdquo;) I suddenly changed the prayer
    preceding the four final decades to &ldquo;Lord, into YOUR hands I
    commend my mother&rsquo;s spirit. Do unto her according to your
    way.&rdquo; That very night HE DID IT HIS WAY! Glory be to God.
    Thanks be to God! The Lord gives and the Lord takes away. Blessed be
    the name of the Lord.</p>
  <p class="western">So it was that at virtually the age of 64 I was
    finally <i>alone</i> in the sense of being irrevocably severed from
    the umbilical cord, both my parents being laid to rest. It&rsquo;s
    only natural that one would take a backward look, wondering if one
    had done enough or all one could. We felt no cause for regret,
    feeling we had done our best. The quite common dilemma about
    resorting to a Nursing Home was never a problem for us. In these
    days of ever-increasing longevity, there comes a time when old folks
    not only can&rsquo;t take care of themselves, they become a real
    danger to themselves and to others. Beyond that, loving relatives
    often can&rsquo;t provide the requisite 24-hour surveillance or the
    necessarily professional medical care. In such circumstances
    placement in a Nursing Home is often the kindest and most prudent
    thing one can do for a loved one. As for those who think it results
    in intense loneliness or amounts to cruel abandonment, there is
    another often overlooked aspect of the situation. We&rsquo;re
    talking about the fact of senility. A portion of a letter originated
    by a newspaper editor named Herb Hames and republished by Ann
    Landers is pertinent:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">These are the people who reach out to you
    as you walk down the (Nursing Home) hall. Don&rsquo;t pity them
    because they appear to have no interest in life. They live in a
    world that is very interesting to them. My mom sits in a chair doing
    nothing, but she isn&rsquo;t in that chair at all. She is visiting
    with her mother, or perhaps, she&rsquo;s out to a dance. One day she
    may be playing with her sister or brother. The next day she may be
    raising her family, doing her housework, cutting up Fels Naptha
    soap. Far-fetched? The last time I left her room Mom said happily,
    &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to visit Mama&rsquo;s today. We&rsquo;re
    going to have cookies and milk.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Enjoy
    yourself &ndash; and say hello to Grandma.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Old age robs people of a great deal but it
    leaves them the precious gift of memories of days long gone. They&rsquo;re
    able to recall something that happened 70 year ago, but they can&rsquo;t
    recall what they had for supper. When you see the very old woman
    smile for no reason, or nod and greet an imaginary friend, don&rsquo;t
    think she is crazy. She sees someone you don&rsquo;t see &ndash; a
    loved one from way back. Mom doesn&rsquo;t have any stress and
    strain in her life. She had been through all that. Now is her time
    to relive her life with pleasure. We younger people live for today
    and tomorrow, but Mom lives each day in the past. Who is to say that
    it is unpleasant?</p>
  <p class="western">That&rsquo;s the way it went with my mother. On
    many a visit she&rsquo;d complain of how tiresome it had been in
    school all day. She&rsquo;d always remind me to say goodbye to Mama
    in the kitchen on the way out. She&rsquo;d inquire about all the
    noise the children were making downstairs whenever she&rsquo;d
    overhear a nearby radio. On other occasions she&rsquo;d complain
    that she&rsquo;d had enough vacation and was ready to get back to
    work, and that she didn&rsquo;t like the hotel food anyway &ndash;
    everything tasted the same. The strange thing was that she could
    often be making perfect sense to an outsider, or even to you, until
    suddenly she&rsquo;d ask when on earth was her husband (dead nearly
    40 years) going to get home, and did I know he&rsquo;d been out all
    night again. Yes, she had a world of her own, but she still enjoyed
    visits, especially when the visitor, as I&rsquo;ve said, brought one
    of her favorite delicacies &ndash; sour pickles, fried oysters, or a
    chocolate soda. She was just like a little girl at her
    first-remembered birthday party. And this is the proper point at
    which to salute Pat Brady Wright for making mother&rsquo;s last
    years such a party. Pat was a regular, long-staying weekly visitor
    whose visits my mother cherished. THANKS, Pat! When you were on the
    scene Mom had a ball! So it was that, considering where Mom was
    going and her at-long-last serene acceptance of it, we marked her
    passing with a celebration for friends and relatives at our house.
    It seemed a fitting <i>bon voyage</i>.</p>
  <p class="western">Now it was 1982, and Kathleen and I spent Jan at
    the Treasure Cove in Ormond Beach, FL. We played golf at Largo with
    Kathleen&rsquo;s cousin Kirk Krutsch (an usher at our wedding) and
    his wife Penny, and we exchanged visits with Moni and Jerry in St.
    Pete&rsquo;s. Jerry prepared a sumptuous feast of Chicken Oskar with
    asparagus at our apartment on a beautiful Super Bowl Sunday. (San
    Francisco beat Cincinnati 26 to 21). It was a great game. The feast
    was even better! Otherwise we went to the dogs on that trip &ndash;
    literally, at the Dog Track near Orlando. We won substantially (for
    us) on each visit. We then headed home via Austin, TX, not exactly a
    short cut. There we had a nice visit with Mary, Laurie, and Bill.
    Our plans for a picnic at the LBJ ranch were frozen out by an ice
    storm. I&rsquo;ll always remember that Feb week in Texas as colder
    than the North Atlantic during my war days. (Yes, George, &ldquo;Colder
    than the rim of a cocktail glass,&rdquo; etc.)</p>
  <p class="western">This (1982) was the year that AT&amp;T split.
    Hasn&rsquo;t the phone service been improved since? It was also the
    year of the movie Gandhi, the Hitler diary hoax, and completion of
    Israel&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Sinai. The Falkland Islands
    mini-war between Great Britain and Argentina occurred between 2 Apr
    and 14 Jun. This was the year that our departed son, Herbie, would
    have been 21; the year ERA was defeated, General Haig resigned as
    Secretary of State, and Valerie Toth was born. It was also the year
    we took Mo and Bob with us for our 4 Jul trip to Detroit, and had
    Laurie and Jesse with us at Ocean City. Yes, friends, this was also
    the year that Laurie baptized Jesse&rsquo;s Raggedy Ann. Hey! This
    was, in the late Ed Sullivan&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;A really, REALLY
    BIG year!&rdquo; Who will ever forget that wonderfully magic 40th
    Wedding Anniversary surprise party? Kathleen and I certainly never
    will. I think that was just about the nicest thing that ever
    happened to us.</p>

    40th anniversary bash &ndash; August 1982</h3>
  <p class="western">Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t the first especially nice
    thing the children had cooked up for commemorating one of our
    anniversaries. Previously, we had been surprised with the gift of a
    freezer (1968); gifted with a free weekend at the Park de Ville in
    Ocean City (date unknown); and gifted with an extended weekend at
    Williamsburg, VA, at a motel that featured its own par-3 golf course
    (1976). Then came our 40th anniversary of a truly 4.0 marriage.
    Maybe this <i>40</i> emphasis needs a little elaboration. I was, of
    course, graduated from the USNA in the class of 40 and 4.0 is the
    Academy&rsquo;s top mark of excellence. Beyond that, 40 years is an
    important biblical span with a special hold on our imaginations,
    marking a hiatus between two really key events. Forty years marked
    the wandering of the Jews in the desert between their Exodus from
    captivity and their entrance into the Promised Land, the time
    between deliverance and redemption.</p>
  <p class="western">For us it might be said to have marked the
    ceremonies indicative of the <i>beginning of the begetting</i> of
    children (sounds like the name of an old song), and the maturing of
    said children to the point of final role reversal <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>
    us as parents. In short, our child-rearing days were now done &ndash;
    our children now all accepted personal responsibility for their
    lives, and sought to indicate their appreciation for our efforts and
    celebrate the termination of our responsibility. Our sacrifices
    stood redeemed, <i>we</i> had now arrived at the Promised Land of
    parental liberation. A special celebration <i>was</i> in order.
    (What the hell &ndash; it is a great concept!) In any event, our
    children were more than up to the occasion. In fact they outdid
    themselves, and I&rsquo;d suggest they simply rest on their laurels.
    There is <i>no way</i> they can ever top that fabulous celebration
    of 28 Aug 82. It was the first (and probably the <i>last</i> affair
    in my life that I didn&rsquo;t want to leave &ndash; didn&rsquo;t
    want to see end! We started with a nuptial Mass at 1400 in St.
    Bernadette&rsquo;s, complete with the renewal of wedding vows. Then
    there was the reception at the VFW Hall in Wheaton! (We were so glad
    it wasn&rsquo;t held at the Veterans of <i>Domestic</i> Wars. That
    could have given our marriage a bad image.)</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, we only learned what was really going on
    the very night before, when suddenly all of our living children,
    even the far away out-of towners, showed up almost all at once at
    Kinross to present us with our invitation. I&rsquo;m pressed to
    recall a more emotional moment in our lives, certainly in the realm
    of non tragedy. A highlight of the Mass was the singing by Laurie,
    Terri, Jesse and Katie, led by Mary. We also fondly recall our pride
    at George&rsquo;s toast at the reception, and of course I reveled in
    Kathleen&rsquo;s public salute to me as &ldquo;a great lover.&rdquo;
    (Oh, to relive the glories of yesteryear.) &ldquo;BL&rdquo; Meehan&rsquo;s
    catering was superb, and Sr. Kathleen provided the organ
    accompaniment in church (but I could have done without our &ldquo;once
    again for the movies&rdquo; second pass up the church aisle). It was
    a Great Day as sort of befitted a GREAT marriage! THANKS, kids! And
    a special bow to the local planners, KT and Mo!</p>
  <p class="western">How are we doing so far? And the anniversary
    festivities still weren&rsquo;t over. Kathleen and I had planned a
    little celebration of our own. From 15 to 25 Sep we finally enjoyed
    our long-awaited dream trip to Europe, complete with a boat trip up
    the magnificently beautiful Rhine River. We flew from Dulles to
    London, thence to Amsterdam, then by motor coach via the Hague to
    Nijmegen where we embarked for the five- day boat trip up the Rhine
    to Basle, Switzerland. Then it was by rail to Paris, thence by plane
    back to Dulles &ndash; 8,542 miles in 13 days through five countries
    &ndash; at $8 over budget! (Now, kids, you know where you got that
    planning talent.)</p>

    Castles along the Rhine</h3>
  <p class="western">By rising one hour earlier each day the week
    before the trip, we hit the ground running in London, already being
    in sync with British time (an idea we strongly recommend). In London
    we visited the British Museum (Rosetta Stone, Elgin marbles, Magna
    Carta), the pubs, the theatre twice, Westminster Abbey, took a boat
    ride up the Thames to Greenwich, a day trip to Windsor castle and
    the magnificent Hampton Gardens, had dinner at the famous Simpson&rsquo;s
    &ndash; you name it. We celebrated our actual wedding date with a
    superb hot curry dinner in Soho followed by a Glenda Jackson play.
    It was perfect, but it didn&rsquo;t match or top our family affair
    of 28 Aug.</p>
  <p class="western">From London it was off to Amsterdam, another
    culture altogether. We visited all of their many famous art
    galleries (Rijs, Sted, and Van Gogh), the Anne Frank house, the
    Heineken Brewery, a diamond merchant&rsquo;s show room, took a wine
    and cheese by candlelight evening cruise on the canals, AND &ndash;
    are you ready for this? &ndash; McDonald&rsquo;s. Then it was by bus
    via the Hague and a Delft china factory to our boat secured in the
    shadow of a &ldquo;bridge too far.&rdquo; After dragging through
    London and Amsterdam largely on foot, we really enjoyed sitting in
    the sun on deck and watching the scenery roll by us. A highlight of
    this leg of the trip was a stop for Sunday Mass at the fabulous
    cathedral at Cologne. We entered Basle via 21 canal locks and an
    invisible customs office, then it was on to the train and on to
    Paris. By then it was already dusk, however, so we saw much too
    little of the picturesque countryside.</p>

    Rijksmuseum <i>exhibit</i> in Amsterdam</h3>
  <p class="western">Then we were in Paris. What can you say about the
    Louvre (with the Venus de Milo and the Mona Lisa), the Eiffel Tower,
    the Arc de Triomphe, the Jeu de Paume or Notre Dame? And, or course
    we took our now traditional boat ride, this time on the Seine, and
    did our stint at the sidewalk cafes. As in London, we once again
    found the excellent subway system indispensable. I won&rsquo;t even
    resurrect the memory of Kathleen coming down with a fever of 104
    degrees the night before we were due to leave. That cost us our
    planned evening stroll down the Champs Elysees. We did make it to
    the airport on time, however, there to acquire our favorite Shalimar
    perfume. We won&rsquo;t mention the over-zealous TWA steward who
    off-loaded our jackets just before our plane left France. All in all
    the trip was a resounding success and we accumulated some fabulous
    memories. Indeed, 1982 was emerging as a fabulous year!</p>
  <p class="western"><a name="computer"></a>We had been home hardly a
    week before we were off on another adventure. We bought our first
    computer in Sep 82 &ndash; a Vic-20<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote75anc" href="#sdendnote75sym"><sup>75</sup></a>.
    We replaced it about a year later with the adequately more powerful
    Commodore 64 used for composing this very masterpiece. It really <i>has</i>
    markedly changed our lifestyle. I now spend almost 6&ndash;8 hours
    at the keyboard every day, and don&rsquo;t know what I would have
    done without it. Mo did the first hundred or so pages of this epic
    on an office word processor. After that, I&rsquo;d write out this
    memoir in my beautiful script, from which Kathleen would then type
    it up on the C-64. More recently we&rsquo;ve added a spell-checker
    to the WP, and I&rsquo;ve taken to composing directly at the
    keyboard. Suddenly Kathleen is out of a job. In fact, I also do her
    HELP statistics and reports on the computer. I&rsquo;m also still
    trying to develop a winning computer-based horse-handicapping system
    with still marginal success. We&rsquo;ve also acquired a rather
    sophisticated flight simulator program but have been too busy so far
    to really check it out. Needless to say, all my pen-pals are
    delighted that we now do our letters by computer, and I also turn
    out a weekly lectionary-based sermon on the computer<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote76anc" href="#sdendnote76sym"><sup>76</sup></a>.
    As you can tell, we&rsquo;re solidly into this computer age</p>
  <p class="western">The year 1982 closed out with Charlie&rsquo;s
    family leaving Lexington Park for the much nearer locale of Reston,
    Va. Welcome home, guys! A week later Solidarity was out in Poland,
    and over here the NFL was out, as it went on strike. Finally, on 16
    Dec Anne Gorsuch (later Burford) was virtually out, as she became
    the first cabinet officer ever to be found in contempt of Congress.
    The operative word must be found, as surely there must have been
    (and will be) many more who have nothing but contempt for Congress.
    And so the bountiful year of 1982 drew to a close. Who would have
    imagined that 1983 would open with a Redskins triumph over the
    Dolphins in the Super Bowl (27-17), and end with the triumph of the
    Orioles over the Phillies in the World Series? Or who could have
    anticipated that our super-conservative Pope John Paul II would
    start the year by approving a less medieval Code of Canon Law on 25
    Jan? Perhaps these good omens presaged another great family year as
    Kathleen and I (<i>much</i> later) turned 65.</p>

    Author gets <i>Eiffel</i> in Paris</h3>
  <p class="western">Having demonstrated a hopeful ray of
    progressiveness with his overture re Canon Law, the Pope moved
    swiftly to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by solemnly
    announcing on 9 May that he was re-examining the Galileo question.
    Way to go, JP! While the Pope tried to turn the world back into the
    past, the world was winging swiftly into the future. In Feb 83 our
    space probe Pioneer raced by Neptune a mere nine years after
    speeding by Jupiter. Meanwhile, KT and Greg did an end-run to Greg&rsquo;s
    relatives in West Virginia, where KT became the first and <i>only</i>
    family member to opt for the elopement route. This isn&rsquo;t KT&rsquo;s
    sole <i>first and only</i>, claim to fame as the following excerpt
    from one of her letters elaborates:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I don&rsquo;t remember much about my birth
    &ndash; <i>Yuk! Yuk!</i>&acute; &ndash; but neither does Mom! The
    only thing she ever recalled about this stupendous event is that I
    was the <i>first and only</i> kid that ever sent her to the hospital
    <i>early</i> with false labor! That is a very important remembrance,
    and I&rsquo;ll tell you why. When Mom told me that I had to laugh.
    Of course I was the only one to send her to the hospital with a
    false alarm. If that isn&rsquo;t proof that babies exhibit their
    personalities VERY early, even in utero, I don&rsquo;t know what is!
    I&rsquo;m sure they had me in mind when the phrase &ldquo;to cry
    wolf&rdquo; was invented. Plus, I was the only one always trying to
    get attention in any way I could. Mom can verify that! The
    unnecessary hospital trip was just a foreshadowing of things to
    come.</p>
  <p class="western">Anyhow, KT and Greg were wed on 5 Feb 83 in a
    move that surprised (but happily) both sets of parents. (I&rsquo;d
    always liked Greg even though he did eat all the candy bars I&rsquo;d
    unsuccessfully tried to hide.) We weren&rsquo;t present for the
    ceremony, of course, but there were several family celebrations, on
    their return, of what turned out to be the family highlight of the
    year.</p>
  <p class="western">In March TV viewers were thrilling to The
    Thornbirds and The Winds of War , as EPA head Anne Burford finally
    saw the light and left government. Shortly later (18 Jun 83), Sally
    Ride became the first US woman astronaut to leave the earth. Mike
    accompanied us to Belleville <i>(not</i> Bellevue!) that July.
    August was a busy time as we shot our first black into space (it was
    a guy named Bluford, but somehow I wish it had been Michael Jackson
    &ndash; one-way), in the Philippines the government shot Aquino, and
    Begin shot his wad as Israeli Prime Minister. In Sep the Ruskies
    shot down Korean Airliner 007 and 269 innocents (we hope) died. Sep
    83 was also the point at which I bought the word-processing software
    with which Kathleen then commenced to transcribe this epic for
    posterity. In Nov Brezhnev died, and Mary&rsquo;s marriage died as
    Bill split just before Christmas &ndash; taking with him the money
    (his share only, we hope) for a planned Xmas visit home. Enough
    said. I expect that this is sufficient to show that (apart from KT
    and Greg&rsquo;s marriage) 1983 wasn&rsquo;t one of our better
    family years.</p>
  <p class="western">Thus we arrive at 1984, and everybody knows how
    George Orwell warned us about it. Perhaps the temper of the times
    might once again best be conveyed by reprising some bumper-stickers
    of the day: KISSING A SMOKER IS LIKE LICKING AN ASHTRAY; FEED JANE
    FONDA TO THE WHALES; WARNING, I DON&rsquo;T BRAKE FOR GAYS; MORE
    PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN TED KENNEDY&rsquo;S CAR THAN IN NUCLEAR POWER
    PLANTS; I IS A COLLEGE STUDENT; OBVIOUSLY YOU&rsquo;VE MISTAKEN ME
    FOR SOMEONE WHO CARES; NONE FOR THE ROAD; MORE NUKES &ndash; LESS
    KOOKS; WOMEN MAKE GREAT LEADERS &ndash; <i>YOU&rsquo;RE</i>
    FOLLOWING ONE; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS ARE BUILT BETTER THAN JANE
    FONDA; I SPEED UP FOR SMALL ANIMALS; NURSES CALL THE SHOTS; and
    finally, I DON&rsquo;T CARE <i>WHAT</i> YOU LOVE OR <i>WHAT</i>
    YOU&rsquo;D RATHER BE DOING. (And you and George Orwell thought it
    wasn&rsquo;t going to be a good year!)</p>
  <p class="western">The truth is, and isn&rsquo;t it fortunate for
    our sanity, we tend to remember only the good things. No matter how
    heart-rending or soul-searing at the time, bad memories DO tend to
    become blotted out with the passage of time. Not only that, we
    apparently don&rsquo;t long harbor anything, including notes or
    letters, which might serve to remind us of the unhappy events. For
    example, my archives harbor no record of when Anne and Doug called
    it a day on their marriage, or when Johnny and Patti split. I&rsquo;m
    certain things were positively traumatic at the time, and certainly
    we exchanged correspondence on the subject, but no mementos survive.
    Time not only marches on, luckily, it really does heal. As a
    would-be theologian (and almost by definition all of us are
    necessarily do-it-yourself theologians), I still mentally wrestle
    with the problem of trying to reconcile my Catholic belief in the
    permanence of the marriage commitment, and the facts of Anne&rsquo;s,
    John&rsquo;s, and Mary&rsquo;s divorces, and KT&rsquo;s and Mo&rsquo;s
    marriages to divorced persons. Then, with Malcolm Boyd, I have to
    ask, &ldquo;Why does religion separate people instead of unite them?
    Why must universal love give way, in the priorities of organized
    religion, to erecting high walls between people in whom God&rsquo;s
    spirit dwells?&rdquo; There is a great paradox here, and there&rsquo;s
    something in what Boyd says as he continues, &ldquo;I discovered
    somewhat painfully that religion is often misused. It becomes
    self-serving. It loses the dynamic of a holy movement and is
    transformed into a competitive institution. At this stage, religion
    tends to look inwards to the makings of its own worldly success
    rather than outward to the needs of others. It even begins to see
    God in its own image. Its increasingly rigid dogmas limit &ndash; in
    its eyes &ndash; the scope of salvation to its own immediate
    constituency.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m merely confessing that I, too, have
    some problem with the tarnished image of institutional religion.</p>
  <p class="western">Now, I recognize full well that this need not be
    a problem for my <i>children</i>&rsquo;s consciences, and am merely
    admitting that it is sort of one for mine, if only because I like
    order and consistency and feel my beliefs should jibe with the
    realities I confront. So, this marriage commitment business poses
    somewhat of a faith dilemma for me personally. I&rsquo;ve given it a
    lot of prayerful thought. My tentative conclusion (and, since I hope
    I&rsquo;ll never be too old to learn, it can only be tentative) is
    that either the hierarchy&rsquo;s position (not necessarily that of
    the <i>Church</i> &ndash; which includes ALL the people of God) is
    to some degree un-Christ-like and even hypocritical, OR, I&rsquo;m
    misinterpreting it.</p>
  <p class="western">In short, I take a dim view of their subtly
    nuanced and seemingly semantic distinctions between <i>annulment</i>
    and <i>divorce</i>, and find their annulment process downright
    demeaning to the <i>human dignity</i> that they so piously profess
    to esteem. Conversely, I&rsquo;m impressed with the total absence of
    carping or caviling in the many biblical episodes portraying
    Christ&rsquo;s dealings with self-professed sinners who come to or
    were brought to Him. The solution, I&rsquo;m satisfied, lies in the
    inviolability of the <i>good conscience</i> of the involved
    individuals, who should remain free to practice their religion in
    accordance with its dictates, unhampered by necessarily &ldquo;artificial&rdquo;
    ecclesiastical judgments that defy requisite enlightenment and
    precision, for who can divine the mind of another? This marriage
    business, however, is merely one element of what is a bigger problem
    for me personally. Other elements difficult for me to accommodate to
    in varying degrees would be failure to have children baptized,
    failure to attend church, and ridiculing the pope in particular and
    institutional religion in general. Even these concerns only serve to
    frame my root dilemma, which is a consequent perceived failure on my
    part to achieve the one thing which I have throughout this sagging
    saga professed to be the essential goal of my life: a large <i>Catholic</i>
    family.</p>
  <p class="western">By age 67 one has acquired a fair degree of
    experience and attained a reasonably balanced perspective on life.
    One&rsquo;s productive years, both physically and intellectually,
    then lie largely in the past. My so-called life&rsquo;s work now
    remains only a fast-receding, strictly personal memory of no great
    significance. Fame and fortune escaped me, not that they were goals,
    and they would not have assuaged my dilemma had I achieved them. I
    seemingly failed at the one thing that mattered to me: passing on
    the faith! So, one might well be forgiven for exclaiming, &ldquo;Oh,
    what the hell! Was it all really worth it?&rdquo; The immediate
    response has to be a resounding &ldquo;YES!&rdquo; for several
    reasons. First of all, certain of our progeny (notably those who
    shared our good fortune in having Benedictine teachers who
    communicate such a love for the liturgy) seem secure in the practice
    of the faith after our example. Second, the faith wasn&rsquo;t mine
    to pass on, but (given the grace of God) to cherish and nurture
    personally. Faith is, after all, purely a gift of God. Whoever did I
    think I was to have tried to assume HIS job? Third, who is to judge
    that any one or every one of our children doesn&rsquo;t share the
    faith NOW, or may yet come to do so? God himself won&rsquo;t judge
    them until the end of their days, so who am I that I should presume
    to judge them now? And, as Tennyson has remarked, &ldquo;There lives
    more faith in honest doubt &hellip; than in half the creeds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Finally, why should I either hope or expect their
    faith precisely to mirror mine? Consider the vast variety in the
    insect world, for example. Why might we not expect to find as broad
    a diversity among humans in terms of faith-life? Don&rsquo;t we
    profess each individual to be unique? Might it not be that it is
    precisely our <i>uniqueness</i> which gives the greatest glory to
    God? And, isn&rsquo;t the gift of life offered precisely to enable
    each <i>individual</i> to come to a personal awareness of his or her
    total dependence upon Almighty God? Beyond this, the only thing I
    know for sure (I&rsquo;m no longer young enough to know everything)
    is that I&rsquo;m increasingly impressed by how <i>little</i> I
    <i>know</i>. I am more and more suspicious of dogma and rather more
    inclined to accept that <i>loving</i> (as Christ says) indeed
    fulfills the law.</p>
  <p class="western">The truly important thing is to radiate or
    (better said) reflect God&rsquo;s unconditional love back to God,
    and to our neighbor &ndash; including our enemies. It may help
    regarding loving enemies as well as neighbors to recall Chesterton&rsquo;s
    wry observation that this caveat was levied &ldquo;possibly because
    they&rsquo;re the same people.&rdquo; Well, I&rsquo;m more than
    satisfied that our children are very loving persons. Samples of
    their letters incorporated throughout this epic testify to that. So,
    I suppose, what my dilemma really comes down to is not so much any
    conclusion as to a lack of faith on <i>their</i> part, but rather
    some degree of hurt, chagrin, and disappointment on <i>my</i> part
    at the seeming utter rejection by some of them of all institutional
    religion. (Perhaps significantly, I couldn&rsquo;t have conducted
    this very analysis without benefit of my years of increasing
    familiarity with the teachings of the church.)</p>
  <p class="western">The dilemma then devolves into the dual questions
    of: how vital is this, and to what extent am I responsible? As to
    the former, I somewhat hesitatingly and tentatively conclude that
    this question is not crucial. I perceive institutional religion as a
    crutch &ndash; to be seized as an aid if found useful, to be
    eschewed if found otherwise. The church is <i>not</i> forever: the
    Kingdom of God <i>is</i>! A loving demeanor, after all, generates
    its own <i>community of lovers</i>, which may well be another name
    for the Kingdom of God. As to the latter question, I&rsquo;m
    reasonably satisfied that Kathleen and I between us did every thing
    possible, and even tried some things that weren&rsquo;t. End of
    dilemma. But &ndash; please God &ndash; may our children ALWAYS <i>love
      one another</i>!</p>
  <p class="western">Returning at long last to matters of more
    potential interest to any persevering readers, Joe Pugliese (a
    product of love) was born 20 Apr 84 (KT violently rejects the rumor
    that the doctor didn&rsquo;t even have to slap him to raise a cry).
    Mindful of the difficulties I had just been through in trying to
    reconstruct the salient facts surrounding our children&rsquo;s
    births for this epic, I immediately dashed off a letter to the &ldquo;new&rdquo;
    Pugliese family recounting same re Joe&rsquo;s debut. (We&rsquo;ll
    leave the bulk of that detail to KT&rsquo;s memoirs.) Suffice it to
    say that the event wasn&rsquo;t featured on the evening TV news,
    much to Greg&rsquo;s chagrin, especially since Joe had had the PR
    sense to be born on a day appropriately designated from his
    viewpoint as <i>Good</i> Friday! It should also be remarked that,
    not to be upstaged by his mother&rsquo;s birth history, Joe also
    went the false-alarm route. Apparently, however, he was even more
    eager to get out than KT had been, forcing a bikini-cut Caesarian
    delivery. Naturally, even I wouldn&rsquo;t have the temerity to
    observe that 20 Apr was also the birthday of Adolph Hitler.</p>
  <p class="western">On 30 Mar 84 our old watering hole and pizza
    palace, Marrocco&rsquo;s (where Kathleen was surprised by the whole
    family for our 25th wedding anniversary, and where Anne had dined on
    her wedding night) closed after 35 years in business. Coming after
    the somewhat earlier demise of Leonie&rsquo;s, this left us without
    a really good pizza place. (We&rsquo;re still searching as of 4 Feb
    85, even though Eddie Marrocco opened his own pizza-less place on 30
    Aug in the 1100 block of 21st street.) Kathleen and I had enjoyed
    using our Senior Citizen subway passes once a month just to enjoy a
    really good pizza. But life must go on, and on 14 May Mary and Rocky
    were wed in Austin, TX. Laurie was the only family witness, but the
    entire clan celebrated the occasion, which all ardently hoped would
    presage continuing good fortune for the &ldquo;new&rdquo; Blackwell
    family. Not to be outdone by all this, Mo became engaged to Joe
    Perry in Tampa on 31 May. A true pundit might remark that May 84 was
    obviously the Month of the Rocks. I shall stand mute.</p>
  <p class="western">In July we journeyed to Belleville again for the
    4th, this time with Matt. Later, we enjoyed one of the best O.C.
    vacations ever as, in addition to George&rsquo;s clan and visits
    from Greg and John, both Rocky and Mary and Mo and Joe joined us. It
    was a great crowd, and a fine time was had by all. This was our
    first meeting with Rocky and Joe, and we only hope we passed muster
    with them as easily and fully as they did with us. Aug brought the
    ho-hum Russian-less Los Angeles Olympics, my acquisition of a disk
    drive (enabling use of the flight simulator), and Laurie&rsquo;s
    departure with Jesse to San Diego, in preparation for Mary&rsquo;s
    soon-coming deployment to Korea. Mary actually left for the Orient
    on 5 Sep 84, almost as John emerged from social hibernation and
    enjoyed his first post-marital date with a friend of KT and Greg
    named Rita. (They seem perfect for each other &ndash; assuming Rita
    can adapt to John&rsquo;s inherited (maternal side, obviously)
    propensity for circumlocutious prolixity &ndash; and another
    elopement in the family wouldn&rsquo;t be an unhappy surprise.) Also
    in Sep our old high school, St. Anthony&rsquo;s, whose then <i>avant
      garde</i> coed policy happily brought Kathleen and me together,
    announced that it had been re-designated as a <i>girls only</i>
    school. Too bad. Anne and Charlie also had some minor affiliation
    with our old alma mater, Charlie having taken driver-ed there while
    attending Priory, and Anne having technically graduated from there
    after the eventually &ldquo;committed&rdquo; Principal of Holy Names
    had terminated her about a month before graduation. So, here&rsquo;s
    to you, St. Anthony&rsquo;s, you served us well!</p>
  <p class="western">Thus we draw to the close of 84, and what better
    way to commemorate the end of another fine family year than saluting
    Mo&rsquo;s delightful wedding to Joe on the Saturday following
    Thanksgiving! Only Rocky, Mary, and the Toths couldn&rsquo;t make
    it, but we even got a phone call from the Korean contingent amidst
    all the hoopla and hubbub. Another bonus was that the Wright and
    Perry families seemed to hit it off immediately, and that isn&rsquo;t
    always a &ldquo;given&rdquo; on such occasions. And, the weather was
    perfect! Mo arrived by air a week early, and thus took all the heat
    off of her willing but decrepit parents for completing arrangements
    &ndash; dresses, flowers, music, rehearsal, license, etc. (You did a
    fantastic job, Mo, and we salute you!) Moni and Jerry (and the
    groom&rsquo;s younger sister, Tricia) also arrived early, and like
    Mo stayed with us. That sure livened up the old house for a spell!
    Jerry also did yeoman service, effectively operating as de facto
    best man. The groom arrived with his parents a few days in advance,
    and Anne, Jesse, and Laurie arrived just in time for Thanksgiving
    dinner for which we really had a joyful full house.</p>
  <p class="western">The next day we held a special dinner for Joe&rsquo;s
    family, then the next night was the rehearsal dinner (at Anchor
    Inn), and the next the reception blow-out! (No wonder I was having
    heart problems!) The ritual went smoothly, even though I did have a
    game of tag with Joe&rsquo;s small son, Jason, behind the altar.
    Then that magnificent reception, with the best variety of great food
    I&rsquo;ve ever enjoyed at one, and champagne without limit! And
    then Laurie catching the bride&rsquo;s bouquet, and Mike latching on
    to the garter tossed by the groom (as John almost broke his neck and
    back trying to duck it). George and Bobby were among the ushers, all
    in formal attire, as was I for the first (and no doubt the last)
    time in my life. Everybody said Kathleen looked outstanding in her
    bright blue dress, and most thought I looked so distinguished in my
    tux (except Aunt Mary, who told me to take off some weight). It was
    a truly glorious affair, but let&rsquo;s let Mo&rsquo;s follow-up
    letter add her testimony:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Dear Mom and Dad: I thought it appropriate
    that I should let you know how much Joe and I appreciated your help
    and support during one of our most joyous occasions. There is no
    doubt in my mind that it would not have come about so successfully
    without all your time and effort. [Ed. note: Thanks, Mo, we did what
    we could, but you were the real dynamo!]</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Joe and I felt the whole thing was a
    tremendous success, and it was just as I had hoped it would be
    except for lacking a few people I wished could have been there to
    share it. I plan on sharing the videotape with Mary and Martha so
    they can enjoy the next best thing to &ldquo;being there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="quote-western">My main purpose for this letter, though, is
    to express how much your love means to me. Maturing and meeting so
    many different people has made me realize just how lucky I am to
    have such wonderful and understanding parents. You both saw me
    through many poor relationships and had enough trust in me to know
    that things would work out for all concerned. I don&rsquo;t really
    know (and suppose I never will know) if you realize how much your
    trust means to me. I have strived all my life for your approval
    despite peoples&rsquo; objections that the only approval I should
    require is within myself. I tend to agree, in that a person cannot
    survive without self-approval, but I don&rsquo;t think anyone is
    very willing to admit just how much parental approval means to them.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I would have married Joe with or without
    your approval, but it means so much to me to know that you think it
    best. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re concerned by the fact that he&rsquo;s
    divorced and has a child, but Joe and I only see that as an
    advantage.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Sometimes, when I sit back and think, I
    feel like crying because I&rsquo;m so happy. I feel like he&rsquo;s
    a dream come true. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me though &ndash; I
    realize it will not always be peaches and cream, but as the clich&eacute;
    puts it, <i>You KNOW when it&rsquo;s </i><i>right</i>! I love you
    both. s/Mo</p>
  <p class="western">I ask you, after all this, whatever shall we do
    for an encore? Well, speaking personally, I don&rsquo;t think we
    really need one. I feel we&rsquo;ve had it all &ndash; the whole
    enchilada. So, the 17-year locusts are due in 1985. Who cares? So
    Halley&rsquo;s Comet is due in 1986. If I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;ll
    go outside and look, but if not&hellip; Hey! We can&rsquo;t begin to
    count our blessings. We thank God, though, and will just go on
    trying to do His will as long as He wishes. It&rsquo;s been a
    magnificent journey, but apart from a postscript or two, the
    chronological saga must end here. Our last living child has now
    plighted her troth in holy wedlock. To put it another way, we&rsquo;re
    out of a job! So, this seems an appropriate point to conclude this
    epic. (The details of my death would in any case have to be <i>ghost
      written</i>.) We can only hope that you&rsquo;ve enjoyed the trip as
    much as Kathleen and I have.</p>

      XXIII. FULFILLMENT</h2>
  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western">I am part of all that I have met.<span style="font-style: normal">
	&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp;Tennyson</span></p>
  <p class="western">As English poet Sir Edmund Gosse has so
    succinctly put it, &ldquo;Biography is a study sharply defined by
    two definite events: birth and death.&rdquo; By rights, then, every
    true autobiography should conclude with an account of the death of
    the author, as only thus can we be sure that we have arrived at the
    end of the earthly life in question. Forgive me, please, if I must
    demur on this point. Perhaps the closest I could ever hope to come
    to fulfilling such an assignment might be to hazard my <i>last
      words</i>, but even that is fraught with risk. Frankly, according to
    the circumstances and mindful of my propensity to foul up, I&rsquo;m
    sorely afraid I might very well venture something as inelegant as
    &ldquo;Oh, (expletive deleted)!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Nevertheless, (and wouldn&rsquo;t you know it?)
    I&rsquo;ve made a study of other peoples&rsquo; alleged last words,
    just in case I&rsquo;m called upon to speak at the last moment. (One
    MUST be prepared!) First of all, I must confess that I&rsquo;m not
    so overwhelmed by what I&rsquo;ve managed to do as by what I have
    failed to do. For example, I never lived sufficiently in the present
    moment, and never adequately affirmed others. That being the case, I
    hardly feel qualified to express some hitherto unproclaimed nugget
    of wisdom, nor should you expect any such.</p>
  <p class="western">As you might have guessed, the most common exit
    line throughout history has been the exclamation first attributed to
    Christ (Lk 23:46), &ldquo;Father, into Thy hands I commend my
    spirit.&rdquo; This perfect phrase has reportedly been echoed by St.
    Stephen, the apostle Philip, Charlemagne, St. Catherine of Siena,
    Columbus, and Martin Luther, among dozens of others. Certainly no
    one could improve on that, but there have been other gems and some
    truly novel non-gems. British General Henry Havelock had the style
    to say, &ldquo;Come my son, and see how a Christian can die.&rdquo;
    British essayist Joseph Addison gave us, &ldquo;See in what peace a
    Christian can die.&rdquo; Well, both of these are comforting to say
    the least. The same might be said of the expiring epigrams of
    Russian Czar Alexander I and Elizabeth Browning: &ldquo;What a
    beautiful day!&quot; and &ldquo;It is beautiful!&rdquo; Our
    President Grover Cleveland, on the other hand, was somewhat more
    introspective with his farewell line: &ldquo;I tried so hard to do
    what&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s hope he succeeded.</p>
  <p class="western">Poet Henry Heine made a clever exit with, &ldquo;God
    will pardon me. It&rsquo;s his profession.&rdquo; Continuing in a
    religious vein, Pierre Paul Royer-Collard elaborated, &ldquo;There
    is nothing substantial in this world but religious ideas. Never give
    them up, or if you do, go back to them.&rdquo; St. Teresa was more
    succinct, &ldquo;Oh welcome hour &ndash; the end of exile.&rdquo;
    Death Valley Scotty was another loquacious one with his remark, &ldquo;I
    got four things to live by: Don&rsquo;t say anything that will hurt
    anybody. Don&rsquo;t give advice; nobody will take it anyway. Don&rsquo;t
    complain. Don&rsquo;t explain.&rdquo; Pretty solid stuff, that!
    Statesman William Seward laid claim to another gem, &ldquo;Love one
    another!&rdquo; My childhood hero, Al Smith, simply said, &ldquo;Start
    the Act of Contrition.&rdquo; (You wonder if anyone even remembers
    that anymore.) Then we have Carlyle with, &ldquo;So this is death &ndash;
    well&hellip;&rdquo;; and astronomer Maria Mitchell with, &ldquo;Well,
    if this is dying, there&rsquo;s nothing very unpleasant about it.&rdquo;
    Lady Mary Montoya observed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all been very
    interesting.&rdquo; This sampling was culled from a little book
    entitled (would you believe?): How to Speak More Effectively While
    Dying or BYE LINES. Now, that&rsquo;s class.</p>
  <p class="western">So, you might well ask, what is my bye-line?
    There&rsquo;s no quick and easy answer to that. (Wouldn&rsquo;t you
    know it?) Actually, I&rsquo;ve now experienced three occasions when
    I thought I was in imminent danger of death: at the time of my heart
    failure in Nov 79, in the month preceding my 3 Jun 81 bypass
    operation, and on that dreadful early morning of 8 Dec 84. The
    pattern of my reaction was generally the same all three times (there
    being one significant difference with regard to the very last time,
    to be elaborated later). I first emulated Al Smith in a silent but
    intense recital of the Act of Contrition, and then followed this up
    with an also silent little litany of long-favored ejaculatory
    prayers. I would then lapse into a state of spiritual serenity as my
    brain reoriented itself to pragmatic concerns.</p>
  <p class="western">I&rsquo;d review with Kathleen the location of
    our insurance policies, tax records, civil service survivorship
    procedures, and body disposal (Anatomy Board of Maryland) and
    memorial mass plans, etc. Then, we&rsquo;d just wait, seeking as
    much calm and relief as we could under the circumstances. Thus I
    would expect that any final words of mine would probably be quite
    mundane, like Kathleen&rsquo;s last words to me when entering the
    hospital in grave danger herself incident to one of her pregnancies
    that had gone awry: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to take the rolls for
    dinner out of the freezer!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">This shouldn&rsquo;t be too surprising. I always
    felt God knew the state of my mind far better than I could ever
    express it. I feel I&rsquo;ve said just about every thing of
    importance (and a lot of what isn&rsquo;t) to my family &ndash;
    almost all of which I imagine is reiterated in this book. Ready or
    not, I felt I was as ready as I could ever hope to be (and, in fact,
    even felt a little cheated upon my first recovery). And actually, I
    feel I&rsquo;ve lived virtually all my life specifically in
    preparation for dying &ndash; which strikes me pretty much as it did
    Wendy: &ldquo;To die must be an awful big adventure!&rdquo; Beyond
    all that, my several close fly-bys to death (with that one exception
    only alluded to above) were characterized by an almost unreal calm,
    a tremendous sense of serenity, an eerie peace. I might as well have
    been hypnotized. There was no sense of anxiety, no worry, no panic.
    In fact, I was overwhelmed by a sense of well-being. All in all, it
    was a very comforting experience, one I can say I now look forward
    to in a way.</p>
  <p class="western">The foregoing conclusion is to be understood
    solely in reference to my own death. There is another side to this
    coin of which I was to become rudely aware on Friday, 22 Feb 85. It
    seems that around Thanksgiving, just when I was once again having
    problems with my heart, Kathleen herself was having medical problems
    of her own. What with my more dramatic incapacitation, and the
    Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays (with Mo&rsquo;s fantastic
    wedding festivities sandwiched in between), Kathleen didn&rsquo;t
    get around to consulting the medics until early Feb. So it was that
    we got the dismal news on 22 Feb: <i>CANCER of the colon, requiring
      prompt surgery!</i></p>
  <p class="western">It seems she had developed a growth about the
    size of a golf ball in the lower portion of the colon. There was a
    good chance that it was localized, and that it might be excised
    without resorting to abdominal surgery. It might even prove to be
    essentially benign upon further more sophisticated laboratory
    examination. So, surgery was set for Tuesday, 12 Mar 1985. The
    intervening 18 days seemed to us more like 18 years. They were days
    of great anxiety ameliorated only slightly by profuse gallows humor.
    Well, the surgery turned out to be almost a &ldquo;worst case&rdquo;
    event. The main growth was virtually benign, but it had a malignant
    core, which latter generated one major sprout that just wouldn&rsquo;t
    quit. The result was that practically the entire colon had to be
    removed, and Kathleen missed having to have a colostomy by less than
    inch or so.</p>
  <p class="western">It could have been a lot worse, but this fright
    will do, I assure you. It goes without saying that our recent Oct
    experience (losing our 40-year-old neighbor, Maria, to stomach
    cancer in the span of a mere two months) greatly heightened our
    alarm. And, 4-1/2 hours under the knife left Kathleen a pitiful,
    pathetic sight. She was at once exhausted, in shock, and still
    reeling from the anesthetic and other pain-killers. Beyond that, she
    was decorated with a nasal-trachea stomach-pumping tube, a wound
    drain tube, a Foley catheter, and the usual wrist-inserted heparin
    connection. Well, for my part this was something else altogether. I
    had felt rather resigned to my own death, but I was unhinged at the
    sight of this suffering loved one. Devout coward that I am when it
    comes to hospitals and pain, I was amazed to hear myself sincerely
    reiterating, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather it be me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">In short, I learned a few things. I learned the
    <i>depth</i> of what (with the passage of years) may have <i>seemed</i>
    even to us to have become a very comfortable, taken-for-granted and
    complacent sort of love. I learned anew that personal suffering
    could be subsumed by the sight of others suffering. (I had been
    overwhelmed by this before, by the Murmansk &ldquo;basket cases&rdquo;
    in the Tuscaloosa hangar and by seeing George at Balboa, just as he
    himself had been at Scott AFB en route from Balboa to Bethesda.)
    This time the insight was even more profound. It dawned on me that
    indeed Christ could best redeem us only through his own death &ndash;
    divine love demanded a divine victim!</p>
  <p class="western">It was an almost inadvertent quip from KT that
    brought all of this into even sharper focus. Incident to my
    reporting to her how my first post-operative viewing of Kathleen had
    stricken me, she good-humoredly chirped (quite appropriately in some
    now forgotten context), &ldquo;Oh, Dad, Mom <i>likes</i> to suffer!&rdquo;
    We both knew that this was not true, of course. Nobody in their
    right mind LIKES to suffer. But, I knew what KT meant, or rather,
    what it indicated. It showed (not too surprisingly, considering her
    youth) that she still (we hope!) has a lot of living to do. She
    apparently does not yet fully appreciate that when true love
    matures, the lover reaches a point where concern for the loved one
    inevitably, totally, and naturally exceeds self-concern.</p>
  <p class="western">This concern can&rsquo;t be faked, and extends to
    a willingness to lay down one&rsquo;s life for the other. We&rsquo;ve
    seen this in the movies and on TV a hundred times: one spouse
    sacrificing his or her life for the other, a parent sacrificing his
    or her life for a child. Perhaps we all remain just a little bit
    incredulous &ndash; <i>until it happens to us!</i> True love
    ultimately manifests itself only through acceptance of the
    inevitable crosses of life, which is not at all the same as
    welcoming crosses. We learn this &ndash; almost instinctively &ndash;
    the first time even near-tragedy strikes our own spouse or child. So
    it is that I grew through Kathleen&rsquo;s confrontation with
    cancer, as so apparently did Moni. An exchange of letters between
    Kathleen and Moni will make this clear. Kathleen wrote to Moni
    following her operation, thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I decided I had better write to let you
    know that I&rsquo;m on the way back. Before the operation several
    people (including Dad, George and Pat) warned me it would be
    traumatic, but I didn&rsquo;t really understand what they meant. Now
    I know. The body really freaks out when assaulted by major surgery.
    It switches from chills to sweats, it sometimes refuses to accept
    food which it did before, and there are weird mood swings over which
    you have no control. For one who is accustomed to having fairly good
    control over actions and emotions, this is a very humbling
    experience. You realize that you really aren&rsquo;t in charge after
    all.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Happily, I&rsquo;m gradually improving, can
    eat a little more, and do a little more. This is due in great part
    to the tender loving care of my dear spouse. He is my rock and
    refuge. He has put up with my crying jags and my weird mood changes.
    He cheers me up, he keeps the house spick and span, and he buys,
    cooks and serves all my meals. All this from one who only 2&ndash;3
    months ago had a traumatic episode himself (never fully explained)
    and whom I was worrying about. I was doing most of the driving to
    spare him the tension. Now he has taken over completely. What a
    switch!</p>
  <p class="quote-western">There is one somewhat humorous sidelight
    (although I don&rsquo;t find it too amusing). George told me that
    just like amputees have phantom pain where their former limb was, so
    I might get signals from my former colon. Sure enough, it keeps
    telling me that it is full and needs to be evacuated. So I promptly
    go to the bathroom but there is nothing there. The upshot is that I
    spend an inordinate amount of time either feeling the urge or
    sitting on the &ldquo;throne&rdquo; and doing nothing. Some fun! I
    go back to the surgeon for a post-op visit on Friday, so from
    thereon everything is downhill.</p>
  <p class="western">Moni was quick to reply on 29 Mar 85. An excerpt
    from her magnificent letter follows:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">Thanks for your recent letter, Mom. I sure
    hope you showed it to Dad before you sent it. It&rsquo;s so
    insightful in terms of the physical freaking out of the body part. I
    never really thought about that before. And it&rsquo;s also
    touching. Your sentence about Dad being your rock and refuge, for
    example, really had an impact on me. What is so neat is that I&rsquo;m
    sure Dad would just as easily have said the same thing about you.
    Both of you are so special. I thank God I have parents like you.
    Taken apart you are each extraordinary in your own way. And taken
    together you&rsquo;re inspiring. I really mean that; although it&rsquo;s
    hard to express exactly what I mean in any letter, I won&rsquo;t
    even try.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I know everyone comes into this world with
    their own unique personality, and I know many things affect one&rsquo;s
    development and growth. But you as my parents have without a doubt
    been the single most important influence on me. I can just hear the
    snide comments &ndash; but I don&rsquo;t care. Taking the good with
    the bad, I&rsquo;m still happy with who I am. I also know that Jerry
    and I have the kind of a marriage that the majority of couples will
    never come close to, or be able to understand.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I owe this to you, I feel, because you all
    continue to grow and change and allow me to see and be part of it. I
    learn so much. Just think how your relationship to each other has
    changed over the years. While I&rsquo;ve only been cognizant of your
    influence on me lately, i.e., since about the 1970s on up, it has
    been a particularly healthy example, in terms of spouse
    relationships ever since our shared champagne toast to my engagement
    to Jerry. Do you remember the night? That&rsquo;s when I asked you
    to let me in on your seemingly secret recipe for a healthy marriage.
    Instead you leveled with me. No stock answers, just some eye-opening
    truth which has given me a proper frame of mind in which to view my
    relationship with my husband.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">In only 4-1/2 years we have grown and
    changed and learned so much about each other. When I see glimpses of
    the depth of your relationship, I&rsquo;m filled with delight. To
    know that this development goes on and on is hard to believe when
    one already feels so close. But to see you is to be reassured or
    rather, as I said before &ndash; inspired. Thanks for sharing!</p>
  <p class="western">Thanks, Monica. There&rsquo;s only one postscript
    anent this affair that I should add. You&rsquo;ll recall how, when
    George crashed, it was such an advantage that we (the parents) were
    also pilots. It made the job of the authorities trying to convey the
    situation to us much easier. We spoke the same language. In much the
    same way, Kathleen&rsquo;s major surgery effected yet another link
    in our ability to communicate. Now our mutual surgical adventures
    (as would also be the case with George) allowed us immediately to
    comprehend one another&rsquo;s needs or feelings without even the
    necessity of speaking. We both inherently knew how each other felt
    or was thinking. It was so neat.</p>
  <p class="western">So, back to work, but after that glorious tribute
    of Moni&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m almost ashamed to return to my relatively
    piddling personal problems. However, my last brush with death was
    different in that I was in more acute and continuing pain, and thus
    was dominated by an urgent desire for some relief, which in turn
    compelled consideration of seeking remedial action that exceeded our
    private resources. Thus, while I was resigned to dying as before, I
    was this time confused by an apprehension &ndash; strange to say &ndash;
    that dying might be too difficult to do without some help from well
    meaning medics. I say &ldquo;strange,&rdquo; because I was a
    follower of Norman Cousins in the belief that, &ldquo;A hospital is
    no place for someone who is severely ill.&rdquo; As Cousins
    elaborates, &ldquo;Death is not the ultimate tragedy of life. The
    ultimate tragedy is <i>depersonalization</i> &ndash; dying in an
    alien and sterile area, separated from the spiritual nourishment
    that comes from being able to reach out to a loving hand, separated
    from a desire to experience the things that make life worth living,
    <i>separated from hope</i>.&rdquo; (This, no doubt, is precisely
    what explains the beauty and effectiveness of Mother Teresa&rsquo;s
    concern for the dying.) I&rsquo;d always said that we would NOT go
    to the hospital, that I preferred to die at home. Yet, I suddenly
    found myself struggling to get dressed to head for the hospital
    emergency room. There was one other remarkable feature of this last
    brush with the grim reaper (and it makes no difference whether this
    was a real or imagined threat, it was <i>totally real</i> to me). I
    was seized with a terrible sense of an indescribable, unclassifiable
    impending doom. (Later, I read in one of my medical tomes that this
    is one of the distinguishing features of a heart attack as opposed
    to angina, but if I had one (a heart attack) it&rsquo;s my doctor&rsquo;s
    secret. Personally, I think not (and they say, if you REALLY have
    one, there&rsquo;s NO doubt about it), but I was certainly on the
    very verge.</p>
  <p class="western" align="center" style="page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: avoid">
    BULLETIN&nbsp;!&nbsp;!&nbsp;!</p>
  <p class="quote-western">At precisely 0900 on Wednesday, 6 Feb 85,
    Laurie (and Anne and Jesse) called with the glad tidings that Mary
    is expecting and that Rocky is ecstatic &ndash; as are we! A fast
    local estimate &ndash; necessarily primitive and preliminary &ndash;
    suggests an ETA of 4 Oct 85, the feast of St. Francis of Assisi. <i>God
      speed to all concerned!</i> Grandchildren are the crown of old men
    (Pr 17:6).</p>
  <p class="western">How appropriate! Even as we write of death, <i>LIFE
    GOES ON!</i> Thanks be to God! But, to continue our essay on death,
    in a way I&rsquo;m lucky to be here at all in the first place. The
    WWII statistics on my USNA class of 1940 tell the story: My class
    lost more than ANY class from ANY service academy in ANY war! Lost
    more ANY way you count it! By percent, or by actual numbers! The
    official count is: 12% KILLED IN ACTION! Yes, my class was well
    represented in the battleships at Pearl Harbor. Perhaps the cold,
    rough North Atlantic was not such a bad place to be caught by the
    outbreak of our WWII after all.</p>
  <p class="western">Perhaps this decimation of the ranks also helps
    explain the dearth of my classmates who made flag rank: 15 Admirals
    &ndash; only one making it above Rear Admiral; and four Army or
    MarCorps Generals; a grand total of 19 flags, or a mere three
    percent of graduates &ndash; who in turn comprised only 62% of my
    entering plebe class! We also spawned five doctors and one priest.
    Not to worry, for as Graham Greene has said, &ldquo;Success is &hellip;
    a mutilation of the natural man&rdquo; &ndash; as many a celebrity
    has found out. In any event, I&rsquo;ve now parlayed the notions of
    death and the Navy, the better to introduce what I would favor as
    words appropriate to my final farewell &ndash; a sort of reprised
    epitaph, if you will, comprising two short poems by Walt Whitman. In
    the first, the word &ldquo;eidolon&rdquo; is best interpreted as
    &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; thus:</p>
  <p class="poem-western">Heave the anchor short!<br/>
    Raise main-sail
    and jib &ndash; steer forth,  O little white hull'd sloop,  now
    speed on really deep waters,  I will not call it our concluding
    voyage,  But outset and sure entrance to the truest, best, maturest;
    Depart, depart from solid earth &ndash; no more returning to these
    shores,  Now on for aye our infinite free venture wending,  Spurning
    all yet tried ports, seas, hawsers, densities, gravitation,  Sail
    out for good, eidolon yacht of me!
  </p>
  <p class="western">The second little poem needs no explanation:</p>
  <p class="poem-western">Joy, shipmate, joy! <br/>
    (Pleas&rsquo;d to
    my soul at death, I cry,) <br/>
    Our life is closed, our life begins,
    <br/>
    The long, long anchorage we leave, <br/>
    The ship&rsquo;s
    clear at last, she leaps! <br/>
    She swiftly courses from the shore!
    <br/>
    Joy, shipmate, joy!</p>
  <p class="western">Moving right along (there&rsquo;s life in the old
    boy yet), my USNA class had another distinction: it was the last
    class to have to buy the old-fashioned dress uniforms, complete with
    cocked hat and fancifully upholstered epaulets. We also had to buy
    the velvet-lined boat cloaks made famous by FDR, and every graduate
    had to own a sword &ndash; the last made of top quality
    Czechoslovakian &ldquo;blade&rdquo; steel. In brief, more than life
    came to an end with our class. It marked, aided and abetted by WWII,
    the end of a naval era. And, in a way, the conclusion of this book
    will for me herald a sort of end of an era. Let&rsquo;s face it! I
    know I&rsquo;m on borrowed time, but I&rsquo;m quite comfortable
    with that. The heart is a magnificent, even a miraculous, wonder in
    this world of wonders &ndash; &ldquo;a fist sized pump that can fill
    the Astrodome,&rdquo; according to heart specialist Denton Cooley.
    Yet, it&rsquo;s at the same time fragile. It wears out, even though
    Bernard Baruch once opined that only &ldquo;two things are bad for
    the heart &ndash; running up stairs and running down people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Lord knows I&rsquo;ve had my share of this
    world&rsquo;s delights, foremost among which have been the marvelous
    dual blessings of my devoted spouse and terrific family. I&rsquo;m
    sure you&rsquo;ll find ample testimony of that throughout these
    pages. And there have been numberless less sublime blessings, which
    nonetheless were fantastically unique experiences. To cite just one,
    take flying. I can&rsquo;t improve on fellow Washingtonian Everett
    Johnson&rsquo;s paean to baseball anent someone else&rsquo;s
    observation that &ldquo;Once the ball is in the air, nothing else
    exists,&rdquo; thus:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I considered that very phenomenon only last
    year, in close interaction at first base with a certain third
    baseman. His accuracy was somewhat less than pinpoint, but once the
    ball was in the air there were sublime moments of perfect and utter
    isolation, intense concentration and focus. It was totally
    compelling and so very different from the way I spend most of my
    time: No consultations, no approvals to be sought, no meetings,
    memos, thoughts, calculations; just motion and action, me and the
    ball, in the whole world. Excepting emergencies, there are few
    moments in life, moments with absolute and immediate demands that
    may not be denied.</p>
  <p class="western">Substitute the idea of <i>plane</i> for <i>ball</i>
    and you have the best depiction of the thrilling, unfettering
    freedom of flying that I can imagine. Raising a glorious family is
    on an altogether higher level to be sure, but flying, too, is a
    unique and almost unsurpassed human experience &ndash; a sort of
    first taste of heaven. What I&rsquo;m trying however inadequately
    here to convey is simply the notion that I feel totally <i>fulfilled</i>
    in this so-called vale of tears. I&rsquo;ve even made my peace with
    Grandpa Kirk. Not that we were ever at war, but just that I had not
    heretofore <i>closed the circuit</i> of love as I felt I had with my
    own parents and Grandma Kirk. So it was that I wrote him on the 4th
    monthly anniversary of his 95th birthday (Jan 85) of my admiration,
    respect, and affection for him. I incidentally tried, perhaps too
    subtly, to encourage his detachment from purely worldly concerns,
    especially with <i>things</i>.</p>
  <p class="western">Perhaps I was too conscious of my own need to
    redirect my own fullest attention to God as the clouds close in for
    the <i>final sunset</i> of life. I long ago came to agree with
    Lindbergh, who once confessed he&rsquo;d &ldquo;come to realize
    possessions are a worry&rdquo; and result in a loss of freedom.
    Amen! They are a diabolic distraction. Again, I simply felt Grandpa
    could use his remaining days to better advantage. I&rsquo;ll admit
    I&rsquo;m deaf, but he never has, it seems to me, ever learned to
    listen. One going to meet God shouldn&rsquo;t be too tightly focused
    on self. In writing to him I was merely sharing my own
    self-indictment.</p>
  <p class="western">Lindbergh also said anent his own autobiography,
    and it seems particularly pertinent at this point, &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t
    pass on something of value hereby to others, at least I can clarify
    my own values.&rdquo; And I guess that somewhere along the way that
    became a secondary objective of this lengthy endeavor. My primary
    objective is best summed up in the Bible (Dt 4:9): &ldquo;Make
    certain that you do not forget, as long as you live, what you have
    seen with your own eyes. Tell your children and your grandchildren.&rdquo;
    This sort of postscript merely hints at a few of the guideposts that
    have impressed me along the way. I concluded with St. Ignatius of
    Antioch that, &ldquo;These are the beginning and ending of life:
    <i>faith</i> is the beginning, <i>love</i> the end.&rdquo; And,
    &ldquo;Everyone of us will render account for himself to God (Rv
    14:12).&rdquo; So, I&rsquo;d say with Douglas MacArthur, &ldquo;People
    grow old by deserting their ideals&hellip; You are as young as your
    faith, as old as your doubt; as young as your self-confidence, as
    old as your fear; as young as your hope, as old as your despair.&rdquo;
    To which Pascal adds, &ldquo;A man doesn&rsquo;t show his greatness
    by being at one extreme, but rather by touching both at once.&rdquo;
    Or, as Sirach (31:22) puts it, &ldquo;In whatever you do, be
    moderate!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">I never subscribed to that George Allen/Vince
    Lombardi hogwash that &ldquo;The future is now!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Winning
    isn&rsquo;t everything, it&rsquo;s the ONLY thing!&rdquo; I align
    myself rather with perhaps one of the last real sportsmen, Grantland
    Rice, who said, &ldquo;<i>Trying</i> is the thing.&rdquo; There is
    an almost obscene pressure on <i>winning</i> today &ndash; being
    first, being number one. I agree more with playwright Neil Simon,
    who has observed, &ldquo;It drives me insane. I hate it&hellip;
    Doing your best is what&rsquo;s really important. If winning is the
    only thing, then <i>somebody</i>&rsquo;s got to lose.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s
    the point. A single winner means a multitude of losers, so the odds
    for success are terrible. Winning is largely an impossible ideal,
    one that will guarantee a lot more anguish than satisfaction. As
    Aldous Huxley has remarked, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one corner of
    the universe you can be certain of improving, that&rsquo;s your own
    self.&rdquo; Always try hard to do your best, but also stop along
    the way to smell the roses. After all, God found it necessary or
    desirable to rest 14.3% of the time! All work and no play may make
    jack, but it also makes jerks. The perspective gets skewed and
    proper values get skewered. So I guess that&rsquo;s about where I
    come out. Last words? I&rsquo;d be satisfied if it was merely said
    of me, &ldquo;He kept on trying.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s enough
    challenge for anybody. So saying, let me now conclude with a few
    favorite poetic excerpts that somehow seem relevant:</p>
  <p class="poem-western">Though much is taken, much abides; and
    though<br/>
    We are not now that strength which in the old days<br/>
    Moved
    earth and heaven; that which we are, we are; &ndash;  <br/>
    One
    equal temper of heroic hearts, <br/>
    Made weak by time and fate, but
    strong in will<br/>
    To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Tennyson</p>
  <p class="poem-western">Let me disclose the gifts reserved for
    age<br/>
    To set a crown upon your lifetime&rsquo;s effort; <br/>
    first,
    the cold friction of expiring sense &hellip; <br/>
    Second, the
    conscious impotence of rage &hellip; <br/>
    And last, the rending
    pain of re-enactment<br/>
    Of all that you have done, and been; the
    shame<br/>
    Of motives late revealed, and the awareness<br/>
    Of
    things ill done and done to other&rsquo;s harm<br/>
    Which once you
    took for exercise of virtue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;T.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Eliot</p>
  <p class="western">&ldquo;I will bring my own story to an end here
    too. If it is well written and to the point, that is what I wanted;

      XXIV. EPILOGUE</h2>
  </ol>
  <p class="chapter-quote-western">Wherever we find ourselves &hellip;
    we should seek perfection.<span style="font-style: normal"> &nbsp;
	&ndash;&nbsp;Francis&nbsp;de&nbsp;Sales</span></p>
  <p class="western">This epic was begun 25 May 78, and finished 16
    Mar 85 &ndash; an effort spanning almost seven years! This should
    serve to explain (if not necessarily excuse) the varying styles,
    differing perspectives, repetitions and other such inconsistencies.
    Perhaps you&rsquo;re wondering what possibly could have been left
    out of this torrent of words (now well over 220,000). Well, let me
    incorporate KT&rsquo;s letter requesting this opus, and then <i>you</i>
    be the judge:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I read my first &ldquo;Dear All&rdquo;
    letters from you folks when I arrived at Anne&rsquo;s. They were
    really interesting &hellip; (and) in part are responsible for my now
    wanting you to write an autobiography. The lives of my parents
    really interest me &ndash; especially because you and Mom never talk
    about your past. (Do you have skeletons in the closet, or what?) I
    want to hear more. I want to know: what you went through growing up,
    what you thought and how you changed, what you learned, what
    impressed you as you grew up, what you did during the war, what it
    was like when all us kids started coming, etc.. I want to hear all
    the funny, interesting, sad, happy vignettes of your life &hellip;
    and it would be neat to include the historical side &ndash; what you
    were doing when the Japs struck Pearl Harbor, how the Depression
    affected your parents&rsquo; life-style, etc. All of this interests
    me, because then I&rsquo;d learn about all the things that make you
    what you are. I know that I&rsquo;m the way I am partly due to my
    family&rsquo;s influence, and it would make a lot more sense if I
    could see the whole picture &ndash; why you are the way you are.
    [Ed. note: Why do I get the feeling KT is looking for pitfalls to
    avoid?] Plus, I know you as my adult father, and I&rsquo;d like to
    know what you were like when you were my age &ndash; what you did,
    what your hopes and aspirations were, etc. No small order, I
    realize. [<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><i>R</i></font></font><i>eally</i>?]</p>
  <p class="western">In any event, now EVERYBODY knows where to place
    the blame for this treatise, or should I say travesty! But, I
    wonder, does any child ever really know its father even as an adult?
    I thought I knew mine, but since his death I&rsquo;ve been
    overwhelmed by questions I wish I had asked him about himself &ndash;
    many of them like KT&rsquo;s questions &ndash; and I wonder how he
    would have changed with the fast-changing world from which he made
    such a timely escape. Fathers! Whatinhell are they anyway?
    Essentially, a father is seen as an authoritarian nemesis. (To the
    Japanese, the four most dreaded things on earth are fire, lightning,
    earthquakes and <i>fathers</i>, which latter may explain their
    aversion to our Christian God!) I sort of like author Larry King&rsquo;s
    recorded soliloquy on the subject:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">You see the fix the poor bastard is in
    don&rsquo;t you? He must at once apologize and inspire, conceal and
    judge, strut and intervene, correct and pretend. No matter how far
    he ranges outside his normal capabilities, he will remain
    unappreciated through much of the paternal voyage &ndash; often
    neglected, frequently misread, sometimes profaned by his own
    creation. For all this, the father may evolve into a better man: may
    find himself closer to being what he claims, a strong role having
    ways of overpowering the actor. And if he is doubly blessed, he may
    know a day when his sons (by then, most likely, fathers themselves)
    will come to love him more than they can bring themselves to say.</p>
  <p class="western">Well, there is no question that I evolved into &ldquo;a
    better man&rdquo; in the course of this exercise, AND, I discovered
    that this was <i>due in no small part to the influence of my
      children</i>. In fact, I not only learned a lot about my roots, I
    learned even more about myself. In this respect, a John MacDonald
    remark seems quite apt, &ldquo;Every day, no matter how you fight
    it, you learn a little more about yourself, and all most of it does
    is teach humility.&rdquo; Amen! And writing an autobiography merely
    accelerates the process. (I must also confess John Steinbeck perhaps
    had a point when he observed that, &ldquo;The <i>real</i> me
    inevitably turns out to be a savage, self-seeking little beast.&rdquo;)
    So, let&rsquo;s briefly fix the blame. Note the title of this opus &ndash;
    <i>THAT JACK THE HOUSE BUILT</i>. [I just plain didn&rsquo;t have
    the guts to entitle it <i>The Wright Stuff</i>.] It is meant to
    convey my recognition of the notion that I am to a major extent the
    product of the house in which I lived &ndash; first my parents&rsquo;
    house, and then my own family&rsquo;s house. The major molders of
    <i>whatever it is that I am</i> resided in those two domiciles, and,
    mostly they were <i>women</i>. I mean this to be a cause of pride on
    their part rather than shame. (Who am I to say that they didn&rsquo;t
    do a tremendous job?)</p>
  <p class="western">I tried to start this epic at the very beginning.
    (Actually I wrote the very first AND the last two paragraphs of this
    story at the outset. I just had to know how it was going to come out
    before I could really get into it!) Trying to recall one&rsquo;s
    very first sense of personal awareness in concrete terms is a most
    fascinating exercise, as is trying to trace the original and main
    influences on one &lsquo;s good and bad traits. The results are
    always interesting, and (more often than one is apt to expect)
    sometimes quite surprising.</p>
  <p class="western">My experience in dredging for first recall would
    seem to confirm the theory that conceptualization and memory are
    possible only when one has gained some mastery over a language.
    Certainly I was already <i>thinking in English</i> at the time of my
    first consciously recalled memories. Whether my English has improved
    significantly since those earliest recollections I must leave to the
    reader. But this book is now virtually completed, and so my children
    may forevermore say with Elie Wiesel, &ldquo;My father is not dead.
    My father is a book, and books do not die!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve omitted someone&rsquo;s
    favorite memory (for example: my taking Anne to the Casino Royale on
    her 16th birthday to hear Johnny Tillotson; our picnics to Glen
    Echo; Mary&rsquo;s extended &ndash; 1976&ndash;77 &ndash; support
    through troubling times from a University of Maryland psychiatrist
    who compensated in part for our parental inadequacies; Maureen&rsquo;s
    trust and generosity shamefully exploited by an incorrigible
    &ldquo;friend&rdquo; at the cost of the loss of our three TV sets
    while we were in Europe in Sep 1982, and the impounding of her
    golden little Pontiac Sunbird by the District police; our ill-fated
    attempt to get George into the Congressional Page service/school,
    and his investigation of the Trinitarian priesthood upon completion
    of the eighth grade; the St. Bernadette&rsquo;s carnivals, where I
    won the only thing in my entire life &ndash; appropriately a ham; my
    refusal to a stupefied Special Assistant to SecNav of his offer of
    <i>my boss&rsquo;s job</i> with the confession that, &ldquo;I may be
    the best #2 man in the whole Navy Dept., but <i>no</i> amount of
    money could induce me to take on the grief of being #1!&rdquo;).
    Yes, I&rsquo;ve left things out (never being one for details, you
    might say), but YOU try recalling your entire life and see how
    difficult the task is. But rewarding, too. I confess that I&rsquo;ve
    concluded that everyone should attempt an autobiography. (As
    theologian Bernard Cooke has remarked, &ldquo;For each of us, it is
    the sequence of experienced happenings that tells us ultimately who
    and what we are, what the world around us is all about, what
    transcendent influence works with and upon us, and what response we
    are called upon to give as we help to shape the future.&rdquo;) It
    would never had occurred to me to do so, and I therefore want
    heartily to thank those who commended this course to me. I trust my
    effort doesn&rsquo;t merit the censure of critic Robert Martin who
    remarked anent autobiography that, &ldquo;Most of them are in part
    gestures of defiance, fists shaken against oblivion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">Much of what is here presented is <i>stream of
    consciousness</i> recall, generally aided and abetted by first
    setting down the chronology of contemporary public events as an <i>aide
      memoire</i>. But I also had a lot of help. A Catholic University
    graduate student had written a biography of my father. A
    paternal-side cousin provided my paternal grandfather&rsquo;s
    <i>Memories of an Octogenarian</i>. Several cousins on my mother&rsquo;s
    side provided vital recollections of her roots. Then there were the
    public sources. The Naval Historian provided ship histories for the
    vessels in which I served. I was able to procure a copy of the
    official White House log of FDR&rsquo;s cruise in Tuscaloosa from
    the FDR Hyde Park Library. The civil and military Record Centers in
    St. Louis provided copies of my civilian and military service
    records. And, I was able to acquire all the official records
    pertaining to George&rsquo;s crash under the Freedom of Information
    Act. Then, of course I had access to several good histories covering
    the period of my life, and many good books elaborating certain
    phases of it as, for example, WWII. I&rsquo;ve tried my best to
    provide proper attribution throughout, and I have tried to be
    accurate.</p>
  <p class="western">Consider also how diminished our coverage of
    <i>FAMILY</i> would have been without the abundance of letters from
    our children &ndash; precious gems all! Over the years, I&rsquo;ve
    found that there&rsquo;s a lot that can be said for letters,
    especially in comparison to &ldquo;reaching out to touch someone&rdquo;
    by telephone, and writer Ellen Goodman has said most of it very
    well:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">The telephone call has replaced the letter
    in our lives&hellip; On the telephone you talk; in a letter you
    tell&hellip; [The call] makes demands on us. We are expected to
    respond as quickly as computers&hellip; But we cannot, blessedly,
    &ldquo;interface&rdquo; by mail. There is leisure and emotional
    luxury in letter writing. There are no obvious silences to anxiously
    fill. There are no interruptions to brook. There are no nuances and
    tones to distract.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">A letter doesn&rsquo;t take us by surprise
    in the middle of dinner, or intrude when we are with other people,
    or ambush us in the midst of other thoughts. It waits. There is a
    private space between the give and take for thinking.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">There is an advantage to slowing down the
    pace of communications. The phone demands the kind of simultaneous
    satisfaction that is as elusive in words as in sex. It&rsquo;s
    letters that let us take turns, let us sit and mull and say exactly
    what we mean.</p>
  <p class="quote-western">But you cannot hold a call in your hands.
    You cannot put it in a bundle. You cannot show it to your family.
    Indeed, there is nothing to show for it. It doesn&rsquo;t leave a
    trace. Tell me, how can you wrap a lifetime of phone calls in a
    rubber band for a summer&rsquo;s night when you want to remember?<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote77anc" href="#sdendnote77sym"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
  <p class="western">I apologize to any reader, and more so to my
    departed mother, for the rather uneven under-development of my
    ever-changing and maturing relationship with her. A more qualified
    word-craftsman might have (as I&rsquo;ve remarked elsewhere) etched
    the gradual transition of my mood from insecurity through
    humiliation, resentment, fury, and hatred, on to a path of
    indifference, suspicion, questioning, doubt, satisfaction, remorse,
    false generosity, real generosity, and sacrifice, to love, with all
    the nuances in between, AND not by mere explication but through
    dramatic recounting of illustrative episodes depicting actual
    events. Clearly, I wasn&rsquo;t up to the job, but that is more or
    less the way it went, and over the larger portion of my life. It was
    only when this saga was well along that the <i>father&rsquo;s child</i>,
    which I&rsquo;d always fancied myself to be, suddenly realized he
    was in fact a <i>mother&rsquo;s child</i>! This was without doubt
    the biggest personal surprise of this entire venture. Forthwith I
    made peace with my mother and did my best to recompense her the rest
    of her days.</p>
  <p class="western">Critic Robert Martin has said that, &ldquo;Probably
    the most interesting reason for autobiographical writing is the
    attempt of the writer to understand what has formed his own mind and
    personality. Almost inevitably this relies on memories of his early
    life, for most of us believe &hellip; that character is molded early
    in life &hellip; and that childhood is the most important of all in
    the formation of personality.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve already conceded my
    main preoccupation, once encouraged to begin, soon became to find
    out as best I could <i>what made me what I am today</i>. I have
    already affirmed and now reiterate my finding that the primary
    potter working my formless clay was <i>my mother</i>, and most
    especially in those vital first half-dozen years. This raises a most
    disturbing question in my mind about the potentially stunted (if not
    seriously deformed) personality and character development of so many
    of today&rsquo;s children who pass these vital years without the
    ever-present loving care of (often necessarily) working parents.
    Some handicap seems to me to be virtually inevitable. I don&rsquo;t
    have a solution, but certainly such parents should be aware of this,
    the better to try and compensate.</p>
  <p class="western">Kierkegaard said it: &ldquo;We live our lives
    forward, but we understand them backwards.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s
    certainly true in my case, and it is my hope that this book might
    hasten the understanding process in my children. One does acquire a
    smattering of wisdom along the way, and I should like to try to pass
    on one of my main conclusions before closing out this epilogue. Now
    hold it just a gol-durn minute. As Don Robertson has said:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">I don&rsquo;t mean to sound like some sort
    of propagandist for the, ah, generation gap, but it&rsquo;s nice to
    know some people can live a long time and still be human enough to
    admit they don&rsquo;t know all the answers. You see, that&rsquo;s
    what bugs so many kids &ndash; all these older people who are so
    smug and dump on you about the, ahem, Eternal Verities. It&rsquo;s
    as though God is all the time whispering in their ear. I believe in
    God, but do not necessarily believe that He spends all the time
    whispering in the ear of some automobile salesman from Dubuque. Do
    you &hellip; do you understand what I mean?</p>
  <p class="western">Sure, but there are some lessons from old age, as
    Joseph Kurismmootil has noted: &ldquo;Deep acceptance of life, and a
    tolerance for those maladies that cannot be overcome. These are the
    fruit of ripe age which, knowing all, is capable of forgiving all.&rdquo;
    So, I forgive any and all open or closed rebellion at my making even
    the slightest effort at regaling you with my accumulated
    pseudo-wisdom. And, there positively WON&rsquo;T be any big summing
    up of verities. OK? I just want to make <i>ONE</i> point. OK? So,
    get hold of your selves now, my dear children, and please TRY to
    bite this bullet! For me, <i>the Church remains the single most
      indispensable guard, guide and guarantee of a good, meaningful life
      and a happy death</i>! There! I&rsquo;ve said it! Now, let me
    elaborate a little. (I can almost hear someone saying, &ldquo;If
    only ONCE he would, just <i>a little</i>.) First of all, point of
    view is everything! (Remember the story of the single marine in a
    ravine who, though surrounded by a goodly force of the enemy,
    reported, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a dozen of the bastards trapped down
    here!&quot;?) Well, the only valid perspective is derived from the
    age-old questions: <i>Where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am
      I going?</i></p>
  <p class="western">The purpose of life IS life! Eternal life! This
    earthly life DOES end. This fact has some important implications &ndash;
    moral implications. Morality, you know, has to do with what we are
    required to <i>do</i> or <i>not do</i> in accordance with our
    beliefs. And I concede that Graham Greene had a point when he noted
    that, &ldquo;Morality comes with the sad wisdom of age, when the
    sense of curiosity has withered.&rdquo; I think St. Augustine proved
    that. And things sure have changed since the so-called good old days
    and today &ndash; penicillin has supplanted prayer, IBM has
    displaced IHS. But there is something to be said for the good old
    days, and John Steinbeck has said it:</p>
  <p class="quote-western">What did they have then that we are losing
    or have lost? Well, for one thing they had rules &ndash; rules
    concerning life, limb, and property; rules governing deportment,
    manners, and conduct; and rules defining dishonesty, dishonor,
    misconduct, and crime. The rules were not always obeyed but they
    were believed in, and breaking them was savagely punished.</p>
  <p class="western">This is what morality is all about &ndash;
    standards of right conduct derived from our bedrock beliefs. Now, of
    course, beliefs can differ, even among people of good conscience,
    but to be human is to be a seeker of TRUTH. And truth can only be
    perceived (and then only partially) in two ways: through <i>reason</i>
    and through <i>revelation</i>. At the same time, there is a
    constantly accumulating reservoir of ascertained truth. Even as each
    individual accumulates truth throughout a lifetime, succeeding
    generations accumulate and pass on truth. <i>Ground Zero</i>, as it
    were, is raised for each succeeding generation. It would be foolish
    for each generation to start over by going back to reinvent the
    wheel, even if it could. This then naturally leads to a
    consideration of <i>institutions</i>, which have the advantage
    (bankruptcy aside) of not necessarily being subject to death.
    Institutions confer the virtually indispensable benefits of
    <i>stability, order, and continuity</i>. We take them so much for
    granted that many who purport to decry institutions are
    unconsciously the first in line to reap their benefits.</p>
  <p class="western">If you were threatened by a mugger wouldn&rsquo;t
    you be glad to hail a policeman? If your house were on fire wouldn&rsquo;t
    you be glad to see the fire department coming? I can assure you that
    when the Japs hit Pearl Harbor EVERY American rallied to the support
    of our Armed Forces. It is a characteristic of institutions always
    to <i>be there</i>! Sometimes people wish they weren&rsquo;t there &ndash;
    until THEY need them &ndash; then it&rsquo;s often too late. But the
    institutions <i>are</i> there! Remember the great speech that the
    drunken lawyer Greenwald unloaded on Keefer at his acquittal
    celebration in <i>The Caine Mutiny</i>?</p>
  <p class="quote-western">While I was studying law and Keefer here
    was writing his play for the Theatre Guild, and Willie here was on
    the playing fields of Princeton, all that time these birds we call
    regulars &ndash; these stuffy, stupid Prussians, in the Navy and the
    Army &ndash; were manning guns. Course they weren&rsquo;t doing it
    to save my Mom from Hitler, they were doing it for dough, like
    everybody else does what they do. Question is, in the last analysis
    &ndash; last analysis &ndash; <i>what</i> did you do for dough? <i>Old
      Yellowstain</i>, for dough, was standing guard on this fat dumb and
    happy country of ours. Meantime me, I was advancing my little free
    non-Prussian life for dough. Of course, we figured in those days,
    only fools go into the armed service. Bad pay, no millionaire
    future, and you can&rsquo;t call you mind or body your own. Not for
    sensitive intellectuals. So when all hell broke lose and the Germans
    started running out of soap and figured, well it&rsquo;s time to
    come over and melt down old Mrs. Greenwald &ndash; who&rsquo;s gonna
    stop them? Not her boy Barney. Can&rsquo;t stop a Nazi with a law
    book. So I dropped the law books and ran to learn how to fly. Stout
    fellow. Meantime, it took a year and a half before I was any good,
    who was keeping Mom out of the soap dish? Captain Queeg!</p>
  <p class="western">As Ernie would say to Vern, &ldquo;Know whata
    MEAN?&rdquo; The institutions are at the ramparts, maintaining the
    continuity &ndash; keepers of the flame. We all lean on them whether
    we recognize it or not. And the Church is an institution. And most
    of us benefit from it however remotely we might be aware of it.
    You&rsquo;ll only find Christ in the gospels, and it was the early
    Church that gave us the New Testament. Not Christ himself. As
    theologian Bruce Vawter has said, &ldquo;To take seriously a
    christology &ndash; is to accept an ecclesiology as well. Here we
    say nothing with regard to church structures or polity; we simply
    insist on the <i>sine qua non</i> of continuity of a people and a
    tradition. <i>A churchless Christianity is historically a
      contradiction in terms</i>, and by the same token any Jesus who is
    not at the same time the Christ of the Church&rsquo;s biblical faith
    is merely the mental or emotional construct of those who have
    <i>parasited</i> on the Church.&rdquo; Or, as biblical scholar
    Raymond Brown puts it, &ldquo;the great anomaly of Christianity is
    that only through an institution can the message of a
    non-institutional Jesus be preserved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">The Church, then, is a sheet anchor &ndash; the
    main support or sure dependence in times of danger. Again, the
    Church is an inexhaustible, never-failing source of spiritual energy
    to which we can (and should regularly) return to get our own
    spiritual batteries recharged. If you don&rsquo;t exercise a muscle
    &ndash; it atrophies. If you don&rsquo;t practice a skill &ndash; it
    deteriorates. If you don&rsquo;t <i>regularly</i> and <i>ritually</i>
    renew and replenish your stock of religious faith &ndash; you lose
    it! If you don&rsquo;t think you need divine help to reach the
    Kingdom of God &ndash; you&rsquo;re a neo-Pelagian at best, and an
    incipient atheist at worst. And, the current generation should be
    the last one to knock the ritualistic aspect of religion. It
    recognizes and even relishes ritual in virtually every other
    context.</p>
  <p class="western">Ritual is, after all, merely a dramatic form
    designed to intensify meaning. Consider the use of rings and the
    tossing of bouquets at weddings, the candlelight processions and
    coffins full of Viet Nam casualty name-tags at war protest rallies,
    the burning of draft cards, the defacing of doors to the Pentagon
    with blood, the observing of a moment of silence at some giant
    public event to commemorate the passing of some celebrity, the
    marriage act in itself, the playing of taps over a fallen hero,
    saluting the flag, the sign of the cross (how did <i>that</i> get in
    here?), the Star Spangled Banner, the SACRAMENTS. They&rsquo;re all
    of a piece. Every true ritual effects what it signifies, and
    intensifies that underlying signification.</p>
  <p class="western">Proper religious ritual serves one further vital
    purpose &ndash; it serves to establish and enhance our <i>sense of
      the sacred</i>, which our modern world has seemingly largely lost.
    In our Church perhaps Vatican II was effectively (however
    innocently) a contributing factor, recognition of which a tentative
    reinstitution of the tridentine mass may signify. The use of Latin,
    the ancient solemnity of Gregorian chant, the aura of incense, the
    purple veiling of statues as Holy Week approached, more stringent
    rules of fast and abstinence &ndash; all of these ritualistic
    adjuncts had a powerful and compelling effect upon establishing and
    enhancing a solid, solemn sense of the sacred. So, it&rsquo;s high
    time, I think, that the younger generation cease disparaging <i>ritual</i>
    &ndash; uniquely in a religious context, it would seem &ndash; as a
    four-letter word. (Too many cynical young adults today seemingly
    recoil from the very mention of the word &ldquo;religion&rdquo; like
    the devil reportedly is repelled by the sight of a crucifix.) &ldquo;When
    you lose all sense of the sacred, then everything assumes an
    unnatural equality and nothing <i>special</i> any longer exists.</p>
  <p class="western">The fact is: Humankind is <i>transcendent</i>. It
    rightly aspires to assimilation into the Kingdom of God! Hans Kung
    insists that, &ldquo;The greatest and most urgent requirement of our
    time (is) a new awareness of transcendence.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re all
    mired in a blas&eacute; society that seemingly worships mediocrity.
    Don&rsquo;t <i>YOU</i> get trapped. Seek excellence! Do your best!
    As Josh Billings has put it: &ldquo;Emulate the postage stamp &ndash;
    it sticks to one thing &rsquo;til it gets there!&rdquo; <i>Carpe
      diem</i>! Like Carlyle said, &ldquo;Our main business is not to <i>see</i>
    what lies dimly at a distance, but to <i>do</i> what lies closely at
    hand.&rdquo; Ignore the crowd, then, which often reacts like
    lemmings going over a cliff. And forsake uncritical devotion to TV
    (which has done its best to level all values and make Sunday just
    another day). Break out your <i>Sunday best</i> once again &ndash;
    for <i>CHURCH</i>!</p>
  <p class="western">You get my point. You may still not accept my
    thesis, but there it is. The Church is our main source of hope and
    help. I firmly believe this, so &ndash; &ldquo;Harden not your
    hearts (He 4:7)!&rdquo; Work in the present, but let your idea of
    fulfillment by a vision of something farther off &ndash; a glimpse
    of <i>The Kingdom</i>. That&rsquo;s about it. I only wanted this
    last hearing on what I&rsquo;ve found to be the most important
    impetus in my life. And you don&rsquo;t have to take my word for it.
    Harken to Samuel Johnson: &ldquo;To be of no church is dangerous.
    Religion, of which the rewards are distant, and which is animated
    only by faith and hope, will glide by degrees out of the mind unless
    it be invigorated and reimpressed by external ordinances, by stated
    calls to worship, and the salutary influence of example.&rdquo;
    There! That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;ve been trying so hard to
    say!</p>
  <p class="western">So, we come to the end of this story of an
    ordinary life. It is one marked by a supreme irony &ndash; a life of
    flight away from the very source of its strength. The Bible (Mt
    1:19) characterizes St. Joseph with a mere five-word epitaph: &ldquo;He
    was a just man.&rdquo; In like manner, I&rsquo;ve confessed that I&rsquo;d
    be quite content if those kind enough to remember me might only say:
    &ldquo;<i>He kept on trying!&rdquo;</i> This, certainly, is my
    legacy from my mother. And so much of my life was spent running from
    her! One might well wonder if such is not the general experience of
    each and every <i>unique</i> human being &ndash; precisely in the
    striving to underscore uniqueness &ndash; a sort of &ldquo;law of
    human perversity&rdquo; which compels us to fight or flee those who
    would make us better.</p>
  <p class="western">No less than Carl Jung has remarked upon this
    strange state of affairs incident to St. Paul, thus: &ldquo;Saul
    owed his conversion neither to true love, nor to true faith, nor to
    any other truth. It was solely his hatred of Christians that set him
    upon the road to Damascus, and to that decisive experience which was
    to decide the whole course of his life. He was brought to this
    experience by following with conviction the course in which he was
    most completely mistaken.&rdquo; So it has been with me. <i>God
      bless you, mother!</i></p>

  <p class="western">As his oldest daughter, and as the person who was
    with him when he died, I have written this brief afterward to record
    the details of <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Dad&rsquo;s
    </font></font>death in 1996, ten years after <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">he
    </font></font>finished this book.
  </p>
  <p class="western">Our mother Kathleen Wright died at home on
    November 13, 1994, having declined further treatment for colon
    cancer earlier that year. Instead of hospital care, Kathleen
    returned home to The Oaks to receive hospice care. George, Charlie,
    and Katie who lived relatively (but not conveniently) close by had
    arranged to be with Dad on a rotating schedule to support our
    parents during Mom&rsquo;s final days. They stood in for their
    brothers and sisters who were unable to be there, and took on the
    physically and emotionally grueling task of helping a loved one take
    their final journey. This is not Kathleen&rsquo;s story, so we are
    spared any attempt to detail how loved and treasured this remarkable
    woman was and how devastated we all were by her loss. But Jack was
    never the same. He had remained strong through her illness. But his
    final year must have been a lonely living hell.</p>
  <p class="western">Our Dad died unexpectedly on November 13, 1995,
    the first anniversary of Kathleen&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p class="western">As the anniversary of Mom&rsquo;s death
    approached, I decided to visit Dad so he wouldn&rsquo;t be alone to
    mark the sad occasion. My husband Ken and I traveled from San Diego
    to spend the weekend with him.</p>
  <p class="western">Although not mentioned in his autobiography,
    Dad&rsquo;s OCD was almost as strong as his faith in God. For
    example, he insisted that the small cast iron frying pan that
    remained on his stovetop be placed with the handle facing in a
    certain direction. Having discovered this during our visit, Ken made
    a point of rotating the handle out of its designated position. Dad
    appreciated the joke.</p>
  <p class="western">When he entered the kitchen the morning of
    November 13 to find the frying pan handle misaligned, he feigned
    outrage at this disturbance in the order of the universe. As Dad
    grumbled and straightened the frying pan, he and Ken laughed over
    the futility of trying to attain perfection.</p>
  <p class="western">I was sitting in the chair Mom used to sit in.
    Ken, knowing we would soon be leaving the non-smoking apartment for
    church stepped outside for a cigarette. Dad headed to his bedroom to
    put on his shoes so we could go outside to meet Ken. He paused to
    smile at me as he walked out of sight down the hallway.</p>
  <p class="western">Then I heard him exclaim &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and I
    heard him fall down in the hallway. I recall pausing for a few
    moments before I went to help him up because I knew he would be
    embarrassed about tripping in his stocking feet. I wanted to give
    him a moment to collect himself.</p>
  <p class="western">When I rounded the corner I saw that he had
    fallen so hard, without even putting out his hands to break his
    fall, that there was a cut on his forehead where he struck the
    floor. I thought he must be stunned because he hadn&rsquo;t moved
    and his eyes were wide open in shock.</p>
  <p class="western">I knelt beside him, touched him, reassured him. I
    must have known he was dead, but I wasn&rsquo;t ready to know so I
    kept speaking softly. At one point, I told him to take a deep breath
    and we would see if he felt ready to get up. I heard a long soft
    breath and had an instant of grace to believe he was still alive. I
    realized I had heard the sigh of his final exhaled breath.</p>
  <p class="western">Then I started thinking maybe he was not quite
    gone, or maybe he was still nearby, so I started speaking for all of
    my sisters and brothers. I thanked him for everything over and over
    again. For a happy childhood, for an example of a happy marriage,
    for unconditional love. I told him we would all always love him and
    remember him and Mom and all they did for us and all their love.</p>
  <p class="western">I remember glancing at the clock so I could tell
    everyone what time it happened, but of course I now have absolutely
    no memory of the time. As we were about to make the ten minute drive
    to church for 9:00 Mass, my sisters and brothers will attest that it
    must have been shortly after 8:00 in the morning.</p>
  <p class="western">When we failed to meet him outside, Ken returned
    to find me kneeling over Dad in the hallway. I was holding Dad&rsquo;s
    hand and telling him to go and be with Kathleen, that she was
    waiting right beside him. He was lying with his good ear to the
    floor, so I was speaking quite loudly into his bad ear. Ken knelt
    beside me and had the presence of mind to check for a pulse.</p>
  <p class="western">Only upon re-reading this autobiography have I
    recalled how Dad researched famous last words. In this book he
    presciently muses on his own eventual last words. &ldquo;...I&rsquo;m
    sorely afraid I might very well venture something as inelegant as
    &lsquo;Oh, (expletive deleted)!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="western">In this book, Dad <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">wrote
  </font></font>several times about how he would want to be
    remembered. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be quite content if those kind
    enough to remember me might only say: &lsquo;He kept on trying!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    As a person of strong and abiding faith, he spent his life trying
    to be a good man and never stopped trying to become a better one.</p>
  <p class="western">Jack Wright&rsquo;s final conversation was about
    adjusting the handle of the frying pan on the kitchen stove. In a
    typically humorous, knowingly futile, and metaphorically perfect
    final moment, he was still trying to set the world right.</p>
  <p class="western">With his last words, Jack Wright was laughing
    with his loved ones about his compulsive need for order. With
    hard-won patience, with gentle humor, and with rueful self-awareness
    of his imperfections, Jack Wright kept on trying.</p>

      <b>COLLEGE RHYTHM</b><br/>
      <br/>
      The first of a
      series of articles on collegiate likes and dislikes as regards dance
      music and dance bands.<br/>
      <br/>
      The writers, staff members of
      publications at their respective schools, have been asked by Variety
      to give the opinion of the student body as a whole rather than pass
      personal judgment. Neither has Variety given further instructions as
      to what was to be said or how. These articles appear as the
      undergraduates have written them, with the expressed opinions being
      their own.<br/>
      <br/>
      Variety publishes the series to give music men
      and band leaders-a cross-section of current undergraduate opinion on
      dance music and bands, with the hope that it will be both
      informative and instructive. For what the college group has to say
      about dance music is deemed 'important in the trade.<br/>

      <b>U.S.
        NAVAL ACADEMY </b><br/>
      By <u><b>D.</b></u> H. Wright,
      <u><b>&lsquo;39</b></u><br/>
      (Annapolis Log)<br/>
      <br/>
      Annapolis,
      April 2.<br/>
      Rumors on Capitol Hill have it that there is at
      present before the House Naval Affairs Committee a resolution to
      change the famous words of the navy's battle song to 'Anchors Aweigh
      Navy, Truck on Down the Field.'  At any rate, a recent canvass of
      the campus indicates that the navy is definitely 'hep'. We are able
      to vouch for the following, and any similarity of these opinions to
      any other opinions is purely coincidental.<br/>
      <br/>
      Last fall the
      general consensus was that Guy Lombardo, Shep Fields, et al, were
      the music masters of the present age. However, an extensive
      educational program was undertaken and gained such impetus that soon
      the popular cry was, 'Out of the cornfields by Christmas.'  For
      purposes of simplicity, the navy divides popular orchestras into
      three categories, namely, 'Off-the-cob,' 'Semi-solid-schmaltz' and
      'Hep'.<br/>
      <br/>
      The outstanding off-the-cob tidbit was undoubtedly
      Orrin Tucker's rendition of 'Oh, Johnny'. The chief fault we can
      find with this one was that Bonnie Baker sang loudly enough to be
      heard, but the aggravating 'singing strings' in the last chorus
      'crawl-out' cinched this selection.<br/>
      <br/>
      The
      semi-solid-schmaltz crown goes to Horace Heidt's Musical Blight. For
      best results, when-playing records by Horace, we suggest you remove
      the needle from your pick-up.<br/>
      <br/>
      The 'hep' honors, were
      garnered by William Count Basie for his version of the WPA workers'
      theme song, 'Well All Right! Dig! Dig! Dig!'<br/>
      <br/>
      Now the
      above observations are based upon the results of a general poll, as
      we have said. In effect, they prove one thing&mdash;swing is here to
      sway. Of course, for dances, dance music is the keynote; but for
      plain listening enjoyment&mdash;it's swing. The phono-maniacs are
      digging Ellington, Basie, Shaw, Goodman, Hawkins, Miller and Harlan
      Leonard.<br/>
      <br/>
      Guy Lombardo is out. Brother Carmen sings as
      though he'd just stepped out of a cold shower, and to the best of
      our knowledge is the only man who sings while inhaling.<br/>
      <br/>
      Kay
      Kyser is a dud. When Kay recently played a theatre date nearby, it
      was suggested that he contact Sec. Ickes and tell him of the
      enormous premiums gained from plowing under every other row. Russ
      Morgan is not for us. His trombone leaves the impression that he
      plays by alternately blowing and sucking, which is great&mdash;for
      harmonicas.<br/>
      <br/>
      The Faves<br/>
      <br/>
      So far we've only told
      you what we don't like&mdash;now we'll-give you the real lowdown.
      For dancing, Glenn Miller is No. 1. His music is full, rich and
      harmonious&mdash;no tricks there. Glen Gray's another favorite. Bob
      Chester, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, and Jan Savitt also rate dancer
      band raves.<br/>
      <br/>
      The best bets in music are well scored tunes
      that offer a wealth of tone color, and a variety of ideas, all ably
      executed by a full band, and not one of these 'music-box' setups.
      This applies to sweet as well as swing.<br/>
      <br/>
      Perhaps the
      mention of a few first-raters from where we are sitting is now in
      order. Lester Young is the favorite sax pumper. Les can be counted
      upon to dig himself into a torrid tenor groove with a tone so solid
      you could sit on it. Boxman Basie is another well-felt sender, what
      with his overpowering pianissimo effects. Tommy Dorsey is okay if
      you're 'feeling that way.' but when 'on the Jersey side' you can't
      overlook that master slush-pump pusher, old Jackson 'T'. Krupa is
      king of the drums&mdash;as long as he doesn't get caught in one of
      his traps&mdash;and drumming is not a cymbal task. Vocalists are
      rare these days, ability being sold short for glamor. However, we
      all agree that Bing Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald have had a corner on
      the chirpin' chores for several years now.<br/>
      <br/>
      The music
      world&rsquo;s forgotten men, the arrangers, can also take a bow from
      our end of the hall. Hats off to Glenn Miller, who has, by virtue of
      his brilliant orchestrations, banged out more hits than the Yanks
      amassed in last season's World Series. It's Glenn and his boys, by
      the way (stand by for station identification) who will be dropping
      anchor hereabouts during June to play for the Ring Dance. </font>

      <b>Special
        to the Times-Herald</b><br/>
      <br/>
      ANNAPOLIS, Md., June 6. With
      national preparedness as his keynote, Navy Secretary Charles Edison
      sounded an ominous warning on this day of days for 456 graduating
      midshipmen in his address at the eighty-third annual exercises of
      the United States Naval Academy.<br/>
      <br/>
      Edison told the
      graduates:<br/>
      <br/>
      &quot;At few times in our nation's history has
      the attention of the American people been more focused on a Naval
      Academy graduating class and their brothers in the service than
      today. The unhappy series of events of this year belatedly has
      awakened our citizens to keen and active interest in our nation's
      defense.<br/>
      <br/>
      <b>&quot;Fleet Must, Be Ready&quot;</b><br/>
      <br/>
      &quot;We
      are determined, if needed, our first line of defense will not fail.
      In the words of our Commander-in-Chief, the President, &ldquo;The
      fleet must be ready.&rdquo;<br/>
      <br/>
      &quot;Like the fleet, each of
      you must be ready. I am confident that you will. The nation trusts
      that you will.&quot;<br/>
      <br/>
      But the blanket of gravity, which
      covered the graduation exercises, gave way to the happy enthusiasm
      of the traditional hat-tossing ceremony after the coveted diplomas
      were awarded at the ceremonies in Thompson Stadium.<br/>

      Caribbean Bases During Cruise</b><br/>
      <b>Party Is on Way to Miami
        to Board Cruiser Tuscaloosa</b><br/>
      By the Associated
      Press.<br/>
      <br/>
      ABOARD ROOSEVELT TRAIN EN-ROUTE TO MIAMI, Fla.,
      Dec. 3. &mdash;President Roosevelt rode down the Atlantic seaboard
      toward Miami today to sail into the Caribbean in search of rest,
      fish and information on defenses vital to the protection of the
      Panama Canal and segments of the North and South American
      coasts.<br/>
      <br/>
      The cruiser Tuscaloosa waited at Miami with two
      destroyers to take him on a trip whose details still were an
      official secret.<br/>
      <br/>
      There was little expectation that the
      President would make a systematic checkup on all the South Atlantic
      and Caribbean sites for naval and air bases acquired from Great
      Britain. But it was understood he might inspect some of them. And
      there was a possibility he might turn up for maneuvers of units of
      the Atlantic patrol force near Puerto Rico next week.<br/>
      <br/>
      Speculation
      of the first site which the Chief Executive might look over centered
      on Jamaica, where a fleet anchorage is to be established at Portland
      Bight. An area on the bight and on Portland Island has been set
      aside for defense batteries.<br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Landing Field to be
        Provided.</b><br/>
      <br/>
      Under an agreement with Britain by which
      the United States traded 30 old destroyers for leases on strategic
      defense spots in British territory in the New World, facilities also
      will be provided in Jamaica for an emergency landing field for
      planes, and for recreational and hospital purposes.<br/>
      <br/>
      While
      there has been nothing more than rumors that war vessels of European
      belligerents have been operating in the Caribbean and South
      Atlantic, special precautions were ordered.<br/>
      <br/>
      Gun crews on
      the Tuscaloosa and the destroyers will maintain a
      con&hellip;<br/>
      <br/>
      <b>(Obscured)</b><br/>
      <br/>
      Identical
      measures were instituted last February when Mr. Roosevelt sailed to
      Panama and into the Pacific in a similar trip combining business and
      recreation,<br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Ample Time for Relaxation</b><br/>
      <br/>
      In
      spite of its defense aspects, the current cruise will give the Chief
      Executive ample time for relaxation and a chance to get in trim for
      a winter in which problems centering around aid to Britain and
      American policy in relation to wars abroad are certain to rise again
      in Congress.<br/>
      <br/>
      The President was taking with him only a few
      White House officials and fishing cronies, including Harry Hopkins,
      former Secretary of Commerce.<br/>
      <br/>
      His immediate party also
      included a 'secretary and military aide, Maj. Gen. E. M. Watson;
      Rear Admiral Ross T. McIntire, Navy surgeon general and White House
      physician, and Capt. Daniel J. Callaghan, presidential naval
      aide.<br/>
      <br/>
      On a 25-hour run to Miami, Mr. Roosevelt broke the
      rule he set last summer getting no farther than a 12-hour train trip
      from Washington. He established the restriction on grounds world
      conditions were so critical he did not feel safe in getting too far
      from the Capital.<br/>
      <br/>
      But he told a press conference Friday
      he might toss another precedent aside and use an airplane to return
      to Washington within his 12-hour limit should any emergency require
      him to become the first president to fly.<br/>
      <br/>
      The Tuscaloosa
      carries planes on catapults. Furthermore, Mr. Roosevelt can keep in
      constant touch with Washington by naval radio.</font></p>

      At 1:25 p.m.
      on Dec. 3 President Roosevelt was piped over the side of the cruiser
      Tuscaloosa docked in Miami harbor. A half hour later, escorted by
      two destroyers, the Tuscaloosa edged away from her pier and headed
      out to sea, while a shore battery blazed a 21-gun salute. To
      thousands who cheered him from the quay, the President waved a
      contented au revoir. By his side on deck stood members of his
      official party. You see them opposite, left to right: Capt. Daniel
      J. Callaghan, the President&rsquo;s naval aide; Secret Serviceman
      Jim Berry; Secret Serviceman Jim Rowley; Rear Admiral Ross T.
      McIntire, the President's physician; Harry Hopkins, the President's
      closest personal friend and adviser; the President; Major General
      Edwin M. Watson, the President's secretary; and Bodyguard Tommy
      Qualters.<br/>
      <br/>
      Though Mr. Roosevelt made something of a
      mystery of his itinerary by telling reporters he was heading for
      Christmas Island to buy Christmas cards and Easter Island to hunt
      Easter eggs, reporters well knew his No. 1 goal was the open sunlit
      sea. He had missed his annual Thanksgiving trip to Warm Springs. He
      had made little news but enjoyed little rest since the election.
      Congress was drifting leaderless, November's achievements in defense
      and aid to Britain being far from spectacular. The President was
      tired and, for him, curiously inert. Best indication that he wanted
      to forget the Battle of Britain for a fortnight was the presence in
      his party of Harry Hopkins, who generally has little to say about
      foreign affairs. Also along was Falla (left), a silent and
      undemanding companion who in recent months has never been long from
      the President's side.<br/>
      <br/>
      On Dec. 4 the Tuscaloosa cruised
      slowly along the coast of Cuba. It stopped briefly at the U. S.
      naval base at Guantanamo, then pushed south. On the 5th it reached
      Jamaica and the first belligerent waters touched by the President
      since the war began. Before his return Mr. Roosevelt planned to
      inspect a few of the bases leased from Britain under the destroyer
      deal of Sept. 8, perhaps to witness U. S. naval exercises off the
      island of Culebra- </font>

      Note</b><br/>
      <b>Off for Vichy Post With Letter to Petain</b><br/>
      <br/>
      NORFOLK,
      Va, Dec, 23. (U.P.). Admiral William D. Leahy, former chief of naval
      operations, sailed aboard the U.S.S. cruiser Tuscaloosa today to
      assume his new duties as U.S. ambassador to the French government of
      Marshal P&eacute;tain.<br/>
      <br/>
      Leahy, accompanied by his wife,
      boarded the Tuscaloosa at the naval base here after an overnight
      boat trip from Washington.<br/>
      <br/>
      The Tuscaloosa, which
      President Roosevelt used for his recent Caribbean Cruise, lifted
      anchor for Lisbon, Portugal at 10 a.m. Leahy will travel by train
      from Lisbon to Vichy, France.<br/>
      <br/>
      The new ambassador, who
      carried with him a personal letter from President Roosevelt to
      P&eacute;tain, was met at Norfolk by officers from the Tuscaloosa
      and escorted to the naval base 10 miles away. His luggage, six
      trunks and a dozen suitcases, followed by Navy truck.<br/>
      <br/>
      The
      letter from President Roosevelt to P&eacute;tain described Leahy as
      a very old friend of the President and said Mr. Roosevelt hoped he
      would be highly acceptable as the country's representative to
      France. It added that the President felt sure the admiral and the
      marshall would speak the same language.&rdquo;</font></p>

    <font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>On the evening of Dec. 22,
      Rear Admiral William T. Leahy, America's new ambassador to France's
      government at Vichy, bade sober farewell to his little grandson,
      Robert Beale Leahy (opposite) and left Washington on one of the
      touchiest missions any U. S. diplomat ever undertook. His task was
      to stiffen the spine of Old Marshal Henri P&eacute;tain against the
      Nazi conqueror, to make Frenchmen aware of America's compelling
      desire for British victory and the restoration of a free democratic
      France (see p. 62 for The Case For France,&quot; Andr&eacute;
      Maurois). A specific ticklish issue he must negotiate concerns the
      protection and fate of Martinique.<br/>
      <br/>
      By choosing Admiral
      Leahy for this job, President Roosevelt delivered a diplomatic coup
      before his envoy ever left U.S. shores. The Vichy post had first
      been offered to P&eacute;tain's old friend, 80-year-old General John
      J. Pershing, who declined because of ill health. Admiral Leahy, one
      of the Navy's ablest officers and one of Puerto Rico's most
      effective governors, will be no less welcome to the Old soldier who
      heads France. He will be distinctly unpopular with Axis agents who
      have sought to swing P&eacute;tain into open cooperation against
      Britain. In recent years thoughtful razor-tongued Admiral Leahy has
      said sharp things about aggressor states. The Nazi press has railed
      at him as a &ldquo;warmonger&rdquo; and &ldquo;bullhead.&rdquo;<br/>
      <br/>
      Supposedly
      because of unsatisfactory boat schedules, Admiral Leahy embarked for
      his post aboard the cruiser Tuscaloosa. From Washington, he steamed
      down the Potomac and Chesapeake Bay on the Old night boat to Norfolk
      where he boarded the warship which took the President on his
      Caribbean cruise. With true diplomatic reserve, Ambassador Leahy
      declined to comment on his appointment. But it was unlikely that
      sensitive Frenchmen would overlook the significance of, the
      big-gunned Tuscaloosa's voyage.</i></font></p>

      U. S. Navy's Biggest Achievement Since
      Spanish-American War<br/>
    </b><br/>
      WITH THE ATLANTIC FLEET, ABOARD
      A FLAGSHIP, OFF CASABLANCA, Nov. 8 (Delayed). Hostile French
      aircraft appeared like a swarm of hornets in the pale dawn sky
      today, and a few minutes later you were in the midst of a panoramic
      naval battle.<br/>
      <br/>
      You stood there on the flying bridge, and,
      like your shipmates, hoped the French would not fight. None of you
      were afraid, but the suspense spawned a strange nervous tension that
      gnawed you inwardly.<br/>
      <br/>
      You waited and wondered whether the
      next moment would bring French shells screaming at your ship. You
      reached into your emergency rations for a stick of chewing gum to
      keep your mouth from drying up during the intense delay.<br/>
      <br/>
      Then
      it all happened&mdash;<br/>
      <br/>
      Their planes sputtering fire at
      ours &hellip; The rattle and boom of our antiaircraft guns rising in
      angry crescendo &hellip; shells from the French battleship, Jean
      Bart, screaming overhead and mushrooming gigantic geysers.<br/>
      <br/>
      You
      have seen America&rsquo;s greatest sea victory in the Atlantic since
      the days of Sampson and Schley.<br/>
      <br/>
      Your ship, bearing the
      flag of Rear Admiral Robert C. Giffen, directed the fight and was in
      the thick of it all the way. You are tired and nearly limp from lack
      of sleep and the strain of battle.<br/>
      <br/>
      The events started
      when a clarion call to general quarters came over the loudspeaker
      system sometime after the 4 a.m. breakfast.<br/>
      <br/>
      At 5:45 a.m.
      you grabbed the day's emergency rations&mdash;a can of sardines, a
      bar of candy and a pack of chewing sum&mdash;and stuffed them into
      your gas mask bag, then hurried up the nearest ladder to the flag
      deck, adjusting your steel helmet as you went. You lugged along a
      kapok life jacket&mdash;just in case.<br/>
      <br/>
      Admiral Giffen
      already was on the flag deck&mdash;he&rsquo;d been there since 4:30
      a.m., after a hasty breakfast of beans and coffee.<br/>
      <br/>
      The
      French had not shown the designated symbol of friendship. Fighting
      already had broken out in near-by areas where our troops
      landed.<br/>
      <br/>
      &quot;Looks like they may fire a few at us,&quot;
      the admiral commented.<br/>
      <br/>
      Admiral Giffen, tall, heavy-set
      and wearing a soft brown sweater over his Navy khaki, was the
      picture of a fighting man deliberately calm on the brink of battle.</font></p>

      <b>Admiral Exposed to
        Fire</b><br/>
      <br/>
      The admiral, his lieutenant, chief signalman and
      marine orderly climbed to the flying bridge. It is exposed on all
      sides to bullets, shrapnel and shell.<br/>
      <br/>
      You stood there
      while the flagship led a column of two other vessels closer and
      closer to this date with destiny.<br/>
      <br/>
      It was 6:30 when the
      admiral sent planes into the sky for a reconnaissance over
      Casablanca.<br/>
      <br/>
      You looked up in time to see French fighter
      planes roaring down our observation craft. A brief dog fight ensued.
      One of our fliers was forced to land in the water, but one of the
      Frenchmen went down in a smoking tailspin and crashed into the
      sea.<br/>
      <br/>
      Our ack-ack opened up. The French flew
      away.<br/>
      <br/>
      Admiral Giffen meanwhile refused to open-fire upon
      the harbor &hellip;as ordered only to protect American troop ships
      from attack by French war vessels.<br/>
      <br/>
      Moments later you
      heard the eerie scream of a shell. It plunged into the water
      uncomfortably close. Another fell on the opposite side. The Jean
      Bart had opened fire. It was 7:03 a.m.<br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Fight
        Starts</b><br/>
      <br/>
      Another flash brightened the shore line as
      French shore batteries swung into action.<br/>
      <br/>
      Admiral Giffen
      was roaring out orders.<br/>
      <br/>
      &ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; He
      exclaimed. This was the secret signal for American ships to open
      fire.<br/>
      <br/>
      A terrific explosion nearly rocked you to the deck
      as your forward belched shells from all guns.<br/>
      <br/>
      Jarring
      repercussions of the salvo snatched away your note book.<br/>
      <br/>
      You
      saw smoke boiling out of the harbor. Someone said the Bart was
      afire, but just then a lookout pointed to port side, announcing the
      approach of a torpedo plane. A destroyer unleashed its guns and the
      plane wheeled away without dropping its torpedo.<br/>
      <br/>
      Shore
      batteries continued pounding at us, but fire control, meanwhile,
      received a report that the Bart had been hit and had ceased firing.
      It was 8:04 a.m.<br/>
      <br/>
      Our ships then laid a concentrated
      bombardment on the shore emplacements.<br/>
      <br/>
      Minutes later a
      kid blurted out a report from our observation planes. Units of the
      French fleet&mdash;submarines, a cruiser of the Primagauget class,
      at least two light cruisers and three destroyers&mdash;were steaming
      out from Casablanca apparently headed northward to attack our troop
      ships.<br/>
      <br/>
      What followed was a flame of compact
      action.<br/>
      <br/>
      Admiral Giffen strided about the deck in a near
      sprint, snapping orders, bellowing encouragement to the men about
      him.<br/>
      <br/>
      &quot;Keep firing!&quot; he said, and once yelled
      out: &quot;Let them have it! Pour it on them! &quot;<br/>
      <br/>
      Suddenly,
      you heard a new note in the loud, crashing symphony of battle. A
      shell thudded into the armor plating on the forward deck, and
      shrapnel clattered across the steel like a thousand dice tossed on
      tin roof. A repair party reported that damage was slight. You were
      happy without reasoning why.<br/>
      <br/>
      At 9:48, the fire control
      tower reported two French destroyer leaders or light cruisers had
      been hit. One of the French ships was down by the stern. Another had
      sunk. Loss of life must have been tremendous. There was no time to
      rescue survivors.</font></p>

      <br/>
      <b>Torpedoes !</b><br/>
      <br/>
      A swift turn to

      them&mdash;two thousand yards from the port side. They looked like
      they'd hit before we could extricate ourselves from that fast, dizzy
      turn.<br/>
      <br/>
      &ldquo;Stand by for torpedoes &hellip;&rdquo;<br/>
      <br/>
      You
      fell to the deck to brace yourself for the blast.<br/>
      <br/>
      You
      waited. They went past&mdash;one to the starboard, three to
      port.<br/>
      <br/>
      The French were continuing a game but losing
      battle.<br/>
      <br/>
      Our main batteries now were hammering hard at the
      Frenchmen. The ships behind were closing in for the kill.<br/>
      <br/>
      The
      French ships soon had the range. Their salvoes repeatedly bracketed
      our beam. Their shells were dyed, the accuracy of their shots being
      determined by the colors of the splashes.<br/>
      <br/>
      Our guns -
      boomed again, and the hapless foe was ensnared in a withering
      cross-fire.<br/>
      <br/>
      With at least two of their number sunk and
      others badly damaged, the French vessels, in a few more salvoes, had
      their fill.<br/>
      <br/>
      We closed in.<br/>
      <br/>
      One of the shells
      whined against the main deck aft and sprayed its splinters into the
      thick iron bulkhead on a deck above.<br/>
      <br/>
      Another French
      destroyer took the count. It was 2:05 p.m., however, before the
      depleted foe withdrew and staggered under the protection of shore
      batteries which had opened up anew.<br/>
      <br/>
      November 8, it can be
      revealed today following surrender of the strategic French Moroccan
      port.<br/>
      <br/>
      Regarded as the most important American triumph in
      the Atlantic since the Spanish-American War, the sweeping victory
      forced capitulation of Casablanca and smashed the focal point of
      resistance to American occupation of northwest Africa.<br/>

  notes here that his memory is that the zip gun was fashioned from a
  6-inch length of the hollow <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">alluminum</font></font>
  shaft of a toy golf club (which just happened to be the exactly the
  diameter of a .22-caliber bullet) wrapped with an entire roll of
  masking tape to an exterior diameter of about one inch, with a
  stubby wooden block taped onto one end as a pistol grip. A .22 shell
  was manually inserted into the back end of the tube. The hammer and
  firing pin consisted of an old house key filed to a point. The hinge
  mechanics of the hammer remain vague (to Charlie.) The hammer was
  forced against the shell by means of a dozen rubber bands. The gun
  was fired by manually pulling the hammer back and releasing it so it
  would strike the back of the shell. Firing caused the &ldquo;bullet&rdquo;
  to fly out of the front of the barrel, while the now-empty shell was
  simultaneously ejected out of the back &ndash; against the force of
  the rubber bands. The usefulness of the &ldquo;gun&rdquo; as a
  weapon was, however, rather limited because the mass of a real &ndash;
  lead!  &ndash; bullet so greatly exceeded the strength of the rubber
  bands that the person firing the gun was at greater risk of being
  hit in the face by the ejecting shell casing than the intended
  victim was of being hit by a slow-moving bullet. In any event, none
  of that mattered, because George had replaced the lead bullets with
  wads of paper (used simply to prevent the entire charge of gun
  powder from spilling out of the shell casing prior to being fired.)
  So, to complete the story, Anne was hit by a wad of paper, while
  George had to duck to avoid being hit by a flying shell casing. I&rsquo;m
  not sure who got the worst end of the exchange. I still have no idea
  where George got the bullets in the first place.</p>

  months. But Charlie believes that Herbie was even more premature
  than Maureen, which might have exacerbated Herbie&rsquo;s condition.
  Martha recalls Herbie being a seven-monther, too, and assumes the
  problem causing the hemorrhage was <i>placenta praevia</i>. In any
  event, Herbie&rsquo;s lungs were not mature enough yet, and there
  were no effective therapies then. Maureen, obviously, either was
  stronger, or was closer to term by several weeks.<br/>
  <br/>
  In any
  event, a funeral and burial had to be arranged. Martha visited
  Pumphrey&rsquo;s in Silver Spring, and then St. Bernadette&rsquo;s.
  At the latter she encountered Fr. Bonfiglio and told him she wanted
  a Mass of the Angels (that being a Mass in which the priest wore all
  white vestments in lieu of the more customary black, and included
  the &ldquo;<i>Gloria</i>&rdquo; as a special sign of joy). Fr.
  Bonfiglio inquired as to the situation, and then unctuously (perfect
  word, Martha thinks) said, &ldquo;Oh, in this case no Mass is
  required.&rdquo; Martha responded sternly, &ldquo;I want one!&rdquo;
  At this point she&rsquo;s pretty sure he was certain she was
  lethally insane, and he didn&rsquo;t argue. It&rsquo;s only since
  Vatican II (actually effective 1 June 1970) that the Catholic Church
  does in fact officially provide a special funeral Mass for <i>innocent</i>
  children.</p>

      <b>ASTORIA</b>, Oct. 15,
      1945.&mdash;It was a port of which many of them had never heard but
      to the crew of the light cruiser Amsterdam, which arrived here
      Sunday, it was the United States in all its glory&mdash;the one
      place in the world they wanted to see.<br/>
      <br/>
      Three hundred of
      the Crew received shore leave Sunday to roam the streets until 11 p.
      m. There wasn't much to do but they just tramped up and down the
      streets of the good old homeland.<br/>
      <br/>
      The cruiser, a
      10,000-tonner of the Cleveland class, came from Tokyo via Okinawa
      and Pearl.<br/>
      <br/>
      Lieut. (jg) Eugene L. Soares of New York city,
      public relations Officer of the ship, described the crowded
      conditions on the ship as something that had to be seen to be
      appreciated. Men slept anywhere they could find room.<br/>
      <br/>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      a mess,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;Everybody sleeps everywhere&mdash;on
      the gun mounts, in the turrets, on the ladders&mdash;probably curled
      up in the funnels for all I know. Nobody can take a step on deck
      without putting his foot in somebody else&rsquo;s face, we chow all

      The Amsterdam, carrying the last word in
      gunnery detection and radar was commissioned January 8, 1945. She
      was sent out to join the fleet in mid-summer and was with the fast
      carrier task force 38 of Halsey's 3d fleet in countless strikes
      which were made against the island of Honshu in the closing days of
      the war.<br/>
      <br/>
      Her marines were the first to land at Yokosuka
      naval base in Tokyo bay, the force which took over control of the
      harbor entrance. These marines were transferred at sea and sent
      ashore, a naval officer casually remarking that &quot;marines do
      anything.&quot;<br/>

  </b>Today such phrases as &ldquo;forms control,&quot; &quot;electronic
  data processing,&rdquo; and &quot;operations research&rdquo; are
  becoming increasingly synonymous with management improvement. There
  may be good reason for this. Nevertheless, this popular notion
  serves to obscure a most vital fact, namely&mdash;despite modern
  office equipment and all manner of enlightened organizations and
  procedures, the really basic ingredient in and concern of management
  is PEOPLE!<br/>
  Management relates to people: not things, and not
  (fundamentally) to ways and means. Management is complex because
  people are complex. Management will always be subject to improvement
  because people will always be subject to improvement.</p>
</div>
<div id="sdendnote58"><p class="sdendnote-western"><a class="sdendnotesym" name="sdendnote58sym" href="#sdendnote58anc">58</a>The
  text of the <i>Navy Management Review</i> item from March 1964
  reads: <b>The New Breed: Info-Maniacs   </b>Today it is common to
  behold reports spawned by machines in ten minutes that mere man
  requires ten hours to read and 10 days to assimilate. This is the
  hallmark of a new breed: <u>the Info-maniac</u>, and his handy-dandy
  electronic computer complete with high speed printer. Volume reigns
  supreme over selectivity and quality in the realm of
  information.<br/>
  Perhaps one prerequisite to improvement is a
  better understanding of the term <u>management information</u>.
  Basically, it is that information which management wants, needs, and
  uses. It is directly proportional to the difference between the
  reasonable expectation of management and the prevailing status of
  things, and is inversely proportional to management's previously
  accumulated relevant knowledge.

  highlighted in yellow with a note in the margin indicating: &ldquo;<i>Written
    in Aug &rsquo;78.</i>&rdquo; Apparently, he wanted to document the
  date on which he had predicted the next Pope. Additionally, there
  was a clipping of an Associated Press article from an unidentifiable
  newspaper dated June 26, 1993, with the headline: <i>Pope Approves
    West African For Church Post &ndash; Move Said to Reflect
    &lsquo;Internationalization.&rsquo;</i> The text of the article

    Country of Benin as Dean of the College of Cardinals, the body that
    elects the Pope.</i>&rdquo; If he got the actual nominee wrong, he

  Jack might be disappointed in the way things stand in the Church

  interesting that Jack admires in these two men the same trait of
  obedience to authority which he himself &ndash; repeatedly
  throughout this book &ndash; seems to have personally and vehemently
  rejected in favor of individuality. Charlie makes this comment, not
  as a criticism, but to point out that perhaps none of us is as fully

  Jack&rsquo;s thoughts about written letters, Charlie notes that he
  repeatedly has been struck by the degree to which the hand-written

  notes that, even with the advent of <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">today&rsquo;s
    ubiquitous </font></font>email and Social Media, few of us today
  probably have available to ourselves those same resources if we were
