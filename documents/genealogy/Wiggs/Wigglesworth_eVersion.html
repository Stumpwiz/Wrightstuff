EDITION NOTE</h2>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">This document is a
reproduction of a manuscript originally produced digitally by Jack
Wright in 1986 from the hand-written notes of its title character,
Dr. Albert M. Wigglesworth. It was re-created from a printed copy of
Jack&rsquo;s product by his son Charles Wright in the summer of 2021,
as a way of making it more accessible to future generations.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">The question arises:
If this is the story of the Wigglesworth clan, then who is Jack
Wright? The answer, only vaguely implied in Jack&rsquo;s Forward with
additional &lsquo;clues&rsquo; sprinkled elsewhere in the story, is
that Jack is a nephew of the book&rsquo;s title character. While that
genealogical description correctly describes Jack&rsquo;s
relationship to Al Wigglesworth, it provides little insight to those
readers who, like this editor, might describes themselves as
&ldquo;relatively illiterate&rdquo; &ndash; that is, someone for whom
Mothers, Fathers, Grandmothers, Grandfathers, Aunts, Uncles, and
Cousins of multiple generations, spread across a large family tend to
blur into a single indistinguishable crowd of relatives. Moreover, it
doesn&rsquo;t identify very precisely where Jack fits into the family
tree. For clarity then, this editor adds here a brief genealogical
explanation:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">As you will read in
the <span style="background: #c0c0c0">FOREWORD</span> to follow, Al
Wigglesworth married Edna Mae Wright. For reference, Jack provides a
graphical representation of the Wright family tree in the <a href="#FamilyTrees">Family
Trees</a> figure at the end of Chapter <span style="background: #c0c0c0">I</span>
&ndash; <span style="background: #c0c0c0">ORIGINS</span> which
depicts Edna Mae as the child of J. E. Wright and Susannah Watson.
The only child depicted in that figure, she was one of eight siblings
comprising two boys and six girls. Her younger brother Herbert F.
Wright (himself mentioned several times (see page <span style="background: #c0c0c0">199</span>,
among others) was Jack&rsquo;s father, making Edna one of Jack&rsquo;s
Aunts. Thus the title character of this book, Al, becomes one of
Jack&rsquo;s uncles.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">As it happened, in
1986, one of Al&rsquo;s sons (yet another Jack, to whom you will be
introduced in due course) suggested that Jack Wright create a context
for the memoir that would give some perspective on the Doctor&rsquo;s
life and the contribution he made to the Navajos and to medicine.
Realizing that the Doctor&rsquo;s father, the 19th Century railroad
construction engineer, Thomas Hudson Wigglesworth, was also worthy of
note, Jack presented an in-depth review of Thomas&rsquo; story as
well.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">This editor&rsquo;s
goal was to simply re-create, as closely as possible, Jack Wright&rsquo;s
original product. Sadly, the original manuscript, with several of
Jack&rsquo;s hand-drawn illustrations, and including numerous family
photographs, has been lost. Surviving copies are all the product of
copy machines and, after multiple generations of copying, picture
quality has suffered greatly. In order to best re-create the
original, this editor recreated most of Jack&rsquo;s hand-drawn
illustrations to improve their legibility. Pictures of a general
nature have been replaced entirely with similar pictures. Family
pictures, however, were not available.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Imagine this
editor&rsquo;s surprise, then, when an Internet search yielded a
downloadable version of an edited (and much-expanded) version of
Jack&rsquo;s manuscript posted by Dennis Jensen (see
<a href="http://dennisjensen.us/WIGG/wigg.htm">http://dennisjensen.us/WIGG/wigg.htm</a>.)
Dennis, it turns out, is the brother-in-law of Ann Barbieri &ndash;
daughter of Jack M. Wigglesworth (who, as noted, suggested that Jack
Wright create this manuscript) and the eldest grandchild of Dr.
Wigglesworth. In Dennis&rsquo; edited version, you will find most of
Jack&rsquo;s original manuscript, plus significant additions,
including comments from many of Dr. Wigglesworth&rsquo;s children and
grandchildren which add tremendous detail to this already engrossing
story. The expanded version of this saga posted by Mr. Jensen also
contains a large number of additional photos and, perhaps more
importantly, extensive list of references to original source material
which will well-serve anyone wishing to delve more deeply into the
stories presented here.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Returning to this
editor&rsquo;s goal of re-creating Jack&rsquo;s work, Mr. Jensen&rsquo;s
creation was set aside and work was begun on transforming the printed
copy of Jack&rsquo;s book into this digital edition. The text was
recovered by scanning the Jack&rsquo;s printed manuscript and then
converting it to digital text using the Optical Character Recognition
software provided by <a href="http://www.pdf2go.com/">www.pdf2go.com</a>.
The resulting text was then painstakingly reviewed to correct
conversion errors and formatted to look as much like the original
manuscript as possible. Some pictures included herein were extracted
(with permission from Ann Barbieri) from Mr. Jensen&rsquo;s version.
Other original pictures could not be located, and are retained in
this edition as copied directly from Jack&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">This editor assumes
responsibility for any and all spelling and formatting errors found
in this version but takes no responsibility for the often painful
attempts at humor that Jack frequently inserts, or for the sometimes
inappropriate cultural references which, though they reflected the
popular culture of the 1980&rsquo;s, have since come to be seen
unseemly as or even racist. Such remarks are retained simply because
they accurately reflect the original writing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Numerous footnotes
(and a few additional photos) were added where this editor felt they
would add useful detail. It is presumed that Jack would have added
such footnotes had the software tools available to him when he
produced the original manuscript provided the capability to do so.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">This editor hopes
you will enjoy reading this as much as he enjoyed editing it.</p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">This Memoir has been
compiled mainly from a hand&ndash;written manuscript crafted by 89
year-old Dr. Albert M. Wigglesworth at Carroll Manor in 1961, just
three years before his death. The <i>MS<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a></i>
essentially covered doctor&rsquo;s early years and education, and
then focused on his quarter-century medical service to the Navajo and
Apache Indians in the southwest USA from 1900 to 1925, when he was
also raising family comprising three young men. This was clearly the
happiest and most fruitful period of Dr. Wigglesworth&rsquo;s life,
which really continued until the death of his beloved wife, the
former Edna Mae Wright, in 1954.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">To round out the
story of their life together resort has been had to other sources,
especially. the archives of their two surviving sons, Frank and Jack
Wigglesworth. Every reasonable effort has been made to credit
published sources, which include but are not limited to the
following: <i>The First A</i><i>m</i><i>er</i><i>icans</i>, Time-Life

<blockquote class="western">WASHINGTON STAR, 16 May 1946: About the
liveliest person in Washington today is a Indian chief, Chee Dodge,
He&rsquo;s in town with a delegation of Navajo braves, trying to
convince Congress it should ante more cash for the education of his
tribe. Chief Dodge has been to the Interior Department and to the
House and the Senate to explain that there are 20,000 Navajo
children, but only schoolrooms enough for 6,000.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">He went before the House Indian Affairs
Committee yesterday to speak his piece, in Navajo. The translation
was supplied by his son, Tom, who wore a tan sports coat, neatly
matching tie and pocket handkerchief, and looks like the successful
lawyer he is.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">When he felt a point needed
amplification, the aged chief would leap to his feet, shake his
magnificent head of white hair, wiggle a dramatic finger, then turn
-loose a torrent of Navajo. And a torrent of Navajo can leave the
verbose member of Congress at a loss for words.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">It turned out the old boy had a sense of
humor, too. Once, without waiting for a translation, he came up with
a reply in perfect English. He then explained to the astonished
committee that he spoke Navajo only because many of the 22 delegates
with him knew no English. &ldquo;Actually I had a tremendous
education for my day,&rdquo; he assured the committee. &ldquo;l went
to school for two months.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">This is the story of
Dr. Albert Matthew Wigglesworth. It is therefore also necessarily the
story of the plight of the American Indian, especially the Navajo of
the desert and mountain area broaching the northern ends of New
Mexico and Arizona and the southern ends of Colorado and Utah. This
would be the Mesa Verde and San Juan Basin areas roughly centered on
the four-cornered conjunction of the aforementioned states &ndash;
the only place in the United States where four states meet, and
accordingly reputed to be the most photographed spot in the entire
country.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">The near
half-century merger (1878-1925) of the Navajo Indians and the
Wigglesworth clan around and south of the Four Corners area of the
Mesa Verde-San Juan Basin region of the southwest USA shall be the
central focus of our story. Here, these two &ldquo;tribes&rdquo; for
all time put to rest the &lsquo;Kipling contention that &ldquo;East
is East, and West is West, and never (Barbara Walters<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym"><sup>2</sup></a>-wise)
the twain shall meet,&rdquo; because, we may now say, it was
precisely through the train that they did meet (about which more
later). Actually, the two parties, both of which originated in the
far north long ago, approached the area from opposite directions,
with the Indians arriving first by perhaps a bare 25,000 years!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Navajo legends
contend that their people (dineh &ndash; pronounced &ldquo;din NAY&rdquo;)
emerged from &ldquo;the underground&rdquo; into the southwest USA.
Don&rsquo;t you believe it! Rather, it seems that the North American
advent of the Indian was more or less a geological &ldquo;accident&rdquo;
of ice-age mechanics. The essential by-product of these frigid forays
was a land bridge called Beringia<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym"><sup>3</sup></a>
which long ago joined Siberia and Alaska. This was a lush land-link
nurtured by the natural fertilizers of sea animals and plant remains.
The verdant foliage lured &ldquo;big game&rdquo; animals from Asia,
and then their hunters.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">It is generally
believed that this bridge was further augmented by a glacier-free
corridor (estimated as no more than 25 miles wide) through northern
Canada only between 20,000 to 28,000 and 32,000 to 26,000 BC<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote4anc" href="#sdfootnote4sym"><sup>4</sup></a>;
a wall of ice as much as a mile high otherwise stretching from the
Atlantic to Pacific and blocking all access south. It is generally
held on the basis of artifacts scattered through the Americas that
the Indians arrived about 30,000 AD! More specifically, Indians are
placed at Mesa Verde, CO, by 1100 AD &ndash; which still represents
quite a jump on the Wigglesworths. The initial occupants of the Four
Corners area (who peaked about 1200 AD) are figured to be the
so-called Anasazi, that being the Navajo word for &ldquo;the Old
Ones.&rdquo; The era of big game is said to have prevailed from about
9000 BC, followed by a period of foraging from about 4000 BC,
followed by the advent of farming around 1000 BC. Some farmers began
forming villages around 300 BC. It was not until about 900 AD that
the Anasazi started building <i>pue</i><i>blo</i><i>s</i>, that being
the Spanish word for &ldquo;village.&rdquo; (One of the most famous
pueblos is the Mesa Verde&rsquo;s <i>Cliff Palace</i> located in an
enormous cave and containing more than 200 rooms capable of
accommodating several hundred people.) Eventually, with the
introduction of sheep (and horses) by the Spanish in the 14th century
AD, the Navajo (&ldquo;Successors,&rdquo; with the Apache, of the
Anasazi) became an essentially pastoral people, but also renowned for
their artistry with turquoise-ornamented silver jewelry and the
weaving of baskets, blankets and shawls.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">One interesting
sidelight of the latter two crafts is the frequent adornment of their
products with the design known as the swastika. Most people born
since the 1930&rsquo;s will most likely recall it with repugnance as
the symbol of arrogant racial superiority flouted by Hitler&rsquo;s
Nazis. That&rsquo;s really too bad, because the symbol has a more
noble connotation as reported in the <i>19</i><i>72 Annual of The
Franciscan </i><i>M</i><i>issions of the S</i><i>o</i><i>uthwest</i>.
The Ae&rsquo;Nishodi Biae Danaezigi, or <i>M</i><i>en </i><i>W</i><i>hose
Robes Drag in The Dust</i> &ndash; or more simply <i>L</i><i>o</i><i>ng
Robes</i>, report therein that extensive research reveals the
swastika in fact to be a fitting symbol of &ldquo;the ethnic unity of
the human race&rdquo; &ndash; in virtue of its prehistoric origin and
almost universal use. It is to this day the principal ornament with
which some Indians deck themselves for the performance of their
religious ceremonies.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Ruth Underhill&rsquo;s
<i>Here Come The Navajos</i> suggests that, &ldquo;The key to the
Navajos comes through their language.&rdquo; With the exception of
the related Apache, it is unlike that of any other Indian tribe.
&ldquo;Navajo sounds and Navajo grammar are entirely different,&rdquo;
according to Dr. Underhill. They have no f, p, q, r, v, or x &ndash;
although all are used for renderings in English, and consonants
predominate. War buffs will recall that, precisely because of the
uniqueness of their native language, Navajos were pressed into
service as telephone and radio communicators in the front lines
during WWII. The Army first stumbled on this bonanza in WWI. It was a
unique service providable only by our American Indians. Most of their
languages had never even been written down, and Navajo was further
complicated in that translation was never word-for-word. (For
example, &ldquo;Hitler&rdquo; was automatically transposed to
<i>Mustache Smeller</i>, and Mussolini to <i>Big G</i><i>o</i><i>urd
Chin</i>, while Doc would become <i>Medicine Man With Limp</i> and
son Frank would be known as <i>Turkey E</i><i>g</i><i>g</i> because
of his many freckles. Incidentally, the Wiggs<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote5anc" href="#sdfootnote5sym"><sup>5</sup></a>
treasure copy # 153 of a 325 copy edition of a two volume <i>Vocabulary
of the Navajo Language</i> produced by the Franciscans at St.
Michael's, AZ, in 1912.) The Navajo <i>code-talkers</i> operated from
Italy to New Guinea in the South Pacific. Some 375 of them had been
recruited into the MarCorps by the end of WWII. The Navajo language
is traceable to tribes inhabiting northern British Columbia and
Alberta, the two westernmost Canadian provinces bordering the USA.
The language is called Athapascan (variously &ldquo;Athabascan&rdquo;
&ndash; there being as many spelling versions of Navajo words as of
the name Gaddafi<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote6anc" href="#sdfootnote6sym"><sup>6</sup></a>,
rhymes with daffy,) due to its orientation around Lake Athapasca &ndash;
Lake of the Reeds, or (in Navajo) <i>there is scattered grass</i>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Another interesting
sidelight of the language is the nature of Navajo names, (For
religiously inclined readers, the Navajo rendering of &ldquo;Jesus
Christ&rdquo; is <i>D</i><i>oo</i><i>daa-Tsaahi</i>, which is not to
be confused with Zippity-Doo-Dah or Doo-Dah-Day. Knowing this, one
still should go to church on Sunday.) The name &ldquo;Navajo,&rdquo;
incidentally, means <i>great planted fields</i>. It might more
appropriately have meant &ldquo;adaptability,&rdquo; since that is
what characterizes the Navajo in great measure. They readily
undertook to learn a whole new way of life as farmers and herdsmen,
whereas the more nomadic Apache stuck largely to foraging and was a
generally nasty neighbor. In fact, <i>Apache</i> is the Zuni word for
&ldquo;enemy,&rdquo; and Geronimo (1829-1909) was still warring
against the US (not without cause) as late as 1885-86 (although he
eventually became a Christian and marched in Teddy Roosevelt&rsquo;s
1904 inaugural parade). Nor was the wily and courageous Cochise
(1815-1874) often mistaken for a really nice guy &ndash; especially
after 1861 when soldiers <i>unjustly</i> hung several of his
relatives. (Even Edgar Rice Burroughs of Tarzan fame was moved to
write two 1927 novels focused on Geronimo or Goy-ath-lay &ndash; <i>the
Man Wh</i><i>o</i><i> Yawns</i>. At one point, he has the wise old
chief say, &ldquo;Some day the <i>Nalga</i><i>i</i><i> Laga</i><i>i</i>
(white eyes) will keep the words of the treaties they have made with
the <i>Inizhin</i><i>i</i> (Indians) &ndash; the treaties they have
always been the first to break.&rdquo; Well, one can hope.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">The Navajo used no
surnames, but had both &ldquo;private&rdquo; and public personal
names. And, like most other Indians, they did not call each other by
the highly poetical names common to novels and old movies, such as
Fleet Antelope, Running Bear, or Soaring Eagle. (Once again, this
paraphrase is all courtesy of the <i>Long Robes</i>.) On the other
hand, one frequently met such prosy names as The Liar&rsquo;s Son,
Frozen Feet, Mister Mud, Little Horse Thief, Squint Eye, or Club
Foot. For this reason Navajo were never addressed by the name under
which known. It would be an offense against decorum and usually not
at all flattering. Hence their bashfulness, too, when asked their
name. They&rsquo;d hedge by saying <i>H</i><i>o</i><i>lla</i>; the
equivalent of the Spanish <i>Quien </i><i>sabe</i> for &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">It shouldn&rsquo;t
be surprising, then, to learn that most Navajos assumed a second or
&ldquo;public&rdquo; name which they used in normal commerce. This
practice was virtually forced upon them by book-keeping incident to
their wanting to be paid. Needless to say, these self-chosen names
were more complimentary, as for example, the equivalent of Mr. Tall
Man &ndash; <i>Q</i><i>ast</i><i>q</i><i>in Naez</i>. It should go
without saying that English translations are generally inaccurate.
Thus, Black Horse is not a proper translation of <i>Bili </i><i>Li</i><i>z</i><i>hini</i>
which literally means &ldquo;He whose horse is black.&rdquo; Little
wonder, then, that the Navajo were generally addressed by the more
generic <i>Q</i><i>astqin</i>, which is &ldquo;Mister,&rdquo; the
equivalent of Senor in Spanish. It only remains to remark that The
Lone Ranger did his faithful Indian companion no honor by calling him
<i>T</i><i>o</i><i>nto</i>, which is Spanish for &ldquo;Crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Perhaps the most
remarkable thing is that shortly before 1300 AD this way of life came
to an abrupt and mysterious end in much of the southwest. Why it did
is a mystery even today, but the most likely explanation seems to be
the abundant evidence of a severe drought that apparently gripped the
region toward the end of the 13th century. This would not, of course,
explain the failure of the Pueblo to return to their monumental
villages. It seems most likely that they discovered that their lands
had in the interim been taken over by more war-like tribes. Thus, it
is generally concluded that the Athapascan predecessors of the Apache
and Navajo infiltrated the area through the 12th to 15th century AD.
These folk were skillful warriors with a new weapon, borrowed from
the Eskimo &ndash; a bow backed and strengthened by springy sinew
which made them the fastest, hardest, straightest shooters in the
west &ndash; as the Spanish, Mexican and United States&rsquo;
governments were to discover in turn. It is said that even today Zuni
mothers frighten naughty children by telling them that the Apache
will come and get them. (The bulk of this early Indian lore is
derived from TIME-LIFE&rsquo;s <i>The First Americans</i>.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Continuing our
historical stage-setting, the Spanish incursion, principally along
the Rio Grande valley, generally transpired between 1540 and 1821.
The Spanish explorer Coronado swept up from Sonora, Mexico, opening
up the American southwest in 1540-42, searching for the fabled seven
cities of Cibola. Legendary for their gold (El Dorado,) they are
believed to have been in the general area of the Zuni country around
Santa Fe and, in fact, Zuni, NM, is the only one of the &ldquo;gold-less&rdquo;
seven cities that survives. (One group split off from Coronado&rsquo;s
party to the west and discovered the Grand Canyon.) As recently as 30
Jun 1986 the Washington Post reported the possible finding of one of
Coronado&rsquo;s 16th century camps &ndash; the first non-Indian
campsite found in New Mexico &ndash; revealing seven iron horseshoe
nails, a sewing needle, a piece of metal horse harness, and burnt
beans and corn kernels, together with fragments of pottery of a type
made and used by the Spanish in the 1500&rsquo;s. The Indians at that
time had neither horses nor iron. Note that Coronado&rsquo;s
settlements preceded the more familiar colonization of our east
coast!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Following its
independence from Spain in 1821, Mexico became monarch of the
southwest until the invasion of U.S. troops in 1846. The treaty of
Guadaloupe Hidalgo ceded the area to the U.S. on 2 Feb 1948. Neither
Spain nor Mexico ever succeeded in subjugating the Navajo. It would
take the U.S. 17 years (although front-page 7 Jul 1986 newspaper
headlines suggest that in their land dispute with the Hopi and the
U.S. government the Navajo may not be fully subdued even yet). The
first foray by the U.S. against the Navajo was concluded at what
would become Ft. Wingate in a peace treaty on 22 Nov 1846. During the
next 15 years six other treaties would be drawn up, agreed to, and
signed: at Beautiful Mountain (20 May 1848), at Chinle (9 Sep 1849),
at Pueblo of Jemez (HAY-mess, 15 Nov 1851), at Laguna Negra &ndash;
just north of Ft. Defiance &ndash; (18 Jul 1855), and at the eventual
Ft. Wingate (25 Dec 1858 and 18 Feb 1861). Only the first (1848)
treaty was ever ratified by the U.S. Senate. Also, during this period
the first military post in Navajo country was established at Ft.
Defiance on 18 Sep 1851. The latter would be the birthplace of all
four of our hero&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">It should go without
saying that these treaties were mostly honored in the breach by both
sides, although the U.S. managed the best PR, and generally succeeded
in placing the onus on the hapless Navajo as war alternated with
peace into the spring of 1863. At this point the U.S. determined upon
an all-out war to subdue the Indians once and for all. Col. Kit
Carson was chosen to spearhead this effort. He succeeded with a
Sherman-like &ldquo;scorched-earth&rdquo; campaign that wiped out the
Navajo shepherds and other livestock, devastated their cornfields and
orchards, burned their hogans, and generally lay waste to their
country and destroyed their economy. The Navajo were virtually
starved into submission. Eventually, half of the tribe (some 8,000)
yielded to the 400 mile <i>Long </i><i>W</i><i>alk</i> from Ft.
Wingate (near Gallup) to internment on a 21 acre plot at Ft. Sumner
on the Pecos River in eastern New Mexico, where they were to remain
for the next four years as President Lincoln proclaimed it a
Reservation. (In 1881 Billy the Kid fared less well, being put to
rest there permanently by a bullet from Sheriff Pat Garrett.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Conditions at Ft.
Sumner were euphemistically described as &ldquo;far from ideal,&rdquo;
which hardly conveyed the notion of Comanche raids, crop failure,
insect infestation, bad water, the depletion of wood for heating and
cooking, and the rampant sickness and disease that prevailed there.
Little wonder that by the end of four years the Navajo were making
ardent overtures for a return to their homeland. This was met by the
U.S. dispatching no less than General Sherman himself (of the
devastating &ldquo;Atlanta march to the sea&rdquo; fame) as
negotiator. Offered a choice of being sent to the Indian Territory in
Oklahoma &ndash; of ultimate &ldquo;Cherokee oil<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote7anc" href="#sdfootnote7sym"><sup>7</sup></a>&rdquo;
fame &ndash; the Navajo opted overwhelmingly to return to their
homeland in a final treaty formalized on 1 Jun 1868. Their trek began
two weeks later, in the company of their first Indian Agent, Theodore
Dobbs. Soon after, Ft. Defiance was designated the-first Agency
Headquarters. Dr. Wigglesworth would make the scene in Dec 1904, One
might be forgiven for conjecturing that his contribution to their
improved health played a significant part in the Navajo being the
largest tribe in the U.S today, numbering about 160,000 in 1980.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">So, now, whence the
Wigglesworths to Ft. Defiance and their tryst with the Navajo anyhow?
Well, they were initially rooted in the far frigid north also, but in
the Scandinavian rather than Siberian area. Our European brothers, of
course, only reached our shores via the Atlantic in the 15th century,
and thereupon set about with a vengeance to eradicate the Indian
culture they encountered much to their surprise. They did a pretty
good job of it, too, but our hero was not a party to it &ndash; about
which much more later. If, before moving on, we might pause a moment
to conjecture a hypothetical conversation overheard by an Indian
between, say, Leif Ericson and Columbus as to whom was the true
discoverer of America, we might well expect him (or <i>h</i><i>er</i>
&ndash; equal time!) to explode, &ldquo;Discover? Hell! We knew it
was here all the time!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Nevertheless, the
Wiggs clan came a long, long way. It all began when the <i>N</i><i>o</i><i>rsemen</i>
from Scandinavia invaded the Franks in the 10th century. (Vikings is
a more generic term for these fearless adventurers, and includes
those bound for the <i>New</i> as well as the <i>O</i><i>ld</i>
World.) The Franks were a Germanic tribe that settled along the Rhine
in the 3rd century. Under our old high school history acquaintance,
Clovis I, they moved into Gaul (the land roughly west of the Rhine
and north of the Pyrenees, and which is perhaps best remembered by
novice Latin students as being &ldquo;divided into three parts<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote8anc" href="#sdfootnote8sym"><sup>8</sup></a>&rdquo;).
In. any event, the kingdom of the western Franks became France in
870. (Yes! There <i>will</i> be a quiz!) With the coming of the
Norsemen the northwestern corner of France eventually became known,
as it is even today, as Normandy (just &ldquo;think&rdquo; <i>D-Day</i>).
This seems as good a time as any to remark that the Anglo-Saxons were
yet another Germanic tribe originally situated at the mouth of the
Elbe (look it up<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote9anc" href="#sdfootnote9sym"><sup>9</sup></a>)
who conquered England in the 5th to 6th centuries. Now you understand
why English bears such a close phonetic relationship to German.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Anyhow, beginning
about 841 the Norsemen regularly penetrated and plundered as far as
75 miles up the Seine to Rouen, and even on to Paris. Their
occupation was finally formally sealed by the treaty of St.
Clair-sur-Epte in 911 which established Rouen as the capital of
Normandy, and the Norsemen leader, Rollo, as the first Duke of
Normandy. (Rouen may be even better remembered as the site of Joan of
Arc&rsquo;s flaming farewell in 1431 &ndash; certainly it was by
Joan). Rollo prevailed until 931, to be succeeded by the second Duke
of Normandy, William Longsword.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">There now followed a
series of Dukes: III &ndash; Robert the Fearless (942), IV &ndash;
Robert the Good (996), V &ndash; Robert the Devil (1027), and VI &ndash;
William (1035). The latter really changed things, putting down a
rebellion of nobles in 1047, and culminating a Norman penetration of
England in 1050 at the battle of Hastings (14 Oct 1046) in which he,
as William the Conqueror, overwhelmed the English (killing King
Harold II, the successor to Edward the Confessor &ndash; of five
pound crown<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote10anc" href="#sdfootnote10sym"><sup>10</sup></a>
fame). He was Crowned King William I on 25 Dec 1064. This was at
about the same time that a comet, to be known as <i>Halley&rsquo;s</i>,
put in its first recorded appearance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Now the scene shifts
somewhat and the plot thickens. So, where are we? In England, at
last, or, to wax poetic: <i>O</i><i>h, to be in England, now that
April&rsquo;s there&hellip;</i> (Credit Robert Browning.) But wait,
we must back-track a bit. It seems that about 950 AD there lived in
Normandy (near Rouen) a man named Herfast, but known as the <i>Forester
of Equipqueville</i>. He had five very beautiful daughters. He is
thus described as the <i>L</i><i>ucky F</i><i>o</i><i>rester</i>,
since these nubile Normans all married prominent knights from whom
descended most of the nobility of Normandy, which later became the
nobility of England. (You don&rsquo;t have to take our word for it,
see Freman&rsquo;s <i>H</i><i>ist</i><i>o</i><i>ry o</i><i>f</i><i>
the Norman Invasion</i>.) The first daughter became the spouse of the
Earl of Hereford, the second of Earl of Warwick, and the third of the
sire of the Earl of Buckingham. The fourth daughter wed the third
Duke of Normandy, whose grandson was to be William the Conqueror.
Finally, the fifth sister married Godfrey, brother of Osbern de
Bolbec, and if you&rsquo;ll just be patient, we&rsquo;ll next recount
how the Wigglesworth clan evolved in due course from this latter
stem. We first wanted to establish (through the relations &ndash; if
you&rsquo;ll pardon that expression &ndash; of the fourth and fifth
sisters) how the Wiggs can claim a lineage back through William the
Conqueror.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Well, the fifth
sister and Godfrey had a son, William, Vicompte de Arques (III). He
had two sons, William (IV) and Osbern (IV), both of whom survived the
battle of Hastings (1066) and are to be found in the Domesday book of
English land-owners with substantial holdings in Yorkshire and
Lincolnshire in northeast England. Guess what? Osbern (IV) had two
sons, William (V) and Osbern (V), and the former had a son, William
(VI). Good grief, Lucy<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote11anc" href="#sdfootnote11sym"><sup>11</sup></a>!
With both of the only two male names this branch apparently knew now
already used, what was poor William (IV) to name his male progeny?
Mysteriously, it is precisely at this point that this line disappears
from the records without a trace. Meanwhile, retribution was swift
for Osbern (IV), since his grandson, William (VI), had no male
off-spring and this line too became extinct. Now, it was all up to
William (V), and he managed both a son and a new name &ndash; Peter
(VI), who came through handsomely by spawning four sons. Well,
suffice it to say that the line continues to William (IX,) who
partially anglicized his name from William de Arques to William de
Arches. Now, it happened that this William (and perhaps his father)
owned the ancient property and town of Wykelsworth, which derived its
name from the old Saxon name of Wykel, and Weorth, the old English
for farm or estate, and thus came down through the years as
Wykelsworth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Now, it also
happened that at about that time there were three or possibly four
William de Arches living in this part of Yorkshire. It is not
surprising, therefore, that our William chose to distinguish himself
by appending de Wykelsworth to his name. There may also have been a
further reason for the name change. Along about 1189 his father&rsquo;s
uncle, Gilbert, had rebelled against the king, and was captured and
his property confiscated. This disgrace may also have impelled our
man to disassociate himself from the de Arches. In any event, the
Wykelsworth fortunes prospered, and the clan for generations occupied
Wykelsworth Manor, comprising some 4500 acres (about 7 miles square).
By the 16th century the family name was variously spelled
Wykelsworth, Wigglesworth, Wiglesworth, and even Wrigglesworth, but
life went on. It went on, in fact, all the way to Palmyra, New York,
where emigrant Matthew Wigglesworth died in 1873.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">We shall pursue the
thread of this family story in the next chapter. Meanwhile, a few
observations seem pertinent. First, a word about the <i>Domesday</i>
(pronounced doomsday) <i>B</i><i>oo</i><i>k</i> &ndash; evidence
supreme of the extraordinary 900 year continuity of the British
government. It is a comprehensive land register and demographic
survey commissioned by William the Conqueror 20 years after the
Battle of Hastings &ndash; which evolves landholder-by-landholder and
almost field-by-field. The name derives from the book being so
formidable as purportedly to suffice as a record for doomsday itself.
It is currently being converted to computers, which has been likened
to straightening up the leaning Tower of Pisa, even as describing the
book as a survey has been likened to saying the pyramids are graves.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Second, following
the evolving and ultimately merging histories of both the Navajo and
the Wigglesworths, one can&rsquo;t help but be struck by the
recurring theme of their violent struggle for survival as wars
succeeded wars. That&rsquo;s the bad news. Lastly, there is the good
news: one is also impressed by a gradual but steady transformation
toward civility. It should be a matter of no small comfort in these
trying times, haunted by the memory of two World Wars and
ever-threatened by potential nuclear disaster, that mankind is
improving. In a sense, that is what this story is all about. The
Wigglesworths, personified by a compassionate Dr. Albert M.
Wigglesworth, confronted the Navajo in the Four Corners area of the
southwest United States, and the ministrations of the good doctor
will do much to mitigate the Indians&rsquo; anti-white instincts as
nourished by the deplorable injustices inflicted by earlier white
pioneers and their government. Our story, then, is that of the
pilgrimage of mankind in microcosm.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Nearly every
American adult remembers <i>the</i> Bear, the late great Alabama
football Coach, Paul &ldquo;Bear&rdquo; Bryant. Most &ldquo;senior&rdquo;
sports fans recall the <i>two Baers</i>; Max, who won the World
Heavyweight Boxing Championship by KO&rsquo;ing Primo Carnera in
1934: and younger brother Buddy, who was one of Joe Louis&rsquo; <i>Bum
of the </i><i>M</i><i>onth</i> victims in 1941<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote14anc" href="#sdfootnote14sym"><sup>14</sup></a>.
And surely <i>everyb</i><i>o</i><i>dy</i> has heard of the <i>three</i>
bears made famous by that prototype hard-to-please vixen, Goldilocks.
But, what about <i>four</i> bears? How many people really know very
much about their forebears? (Sorry about that, folks!) The question
had to be asked in a palatable manner, and we shall now attempt to
answer it for the Wigglesworth clan as descended from our
protagonist, Dr. Albert Matthew Wigglesworth, hereinafter
affectionately referred to as &ldquo;Al.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">We have already
traced the Wigglesworth strand of Al&rsquo;s ancestry from
Scandinavia, via France and England, to New York state at some
considerable length. It is only fair, then, that we interrupt that
story at this point to inject some background concerning the strand
that produced Al&rsquo;s wife. Family tradition has it that the
Wright clan, which spawned Al&rsquo;s devoted wife, Edna Mae Wright
(whom we shall meet shortly), traces it&rsquo;s ancestry as far back
as William Penn. Unfortunately, no documentation on this point comes
readily to hand. We can, however, be a little more definitive
regarding this branch of the family from about the same time (the
late 18th century) that we find the Wigglesworth clan established in
the United States in Palmyra, New York. Specifically, the maternal
line of Edna&rsquo;s family is traceable to the marriage of Elizabeth
Green and a W. W. Dorney,  both of Harford County, Maryland, by the
first American Catholic hierarch and founder of Georgetown
University, Archbishop John Carroll, on 11 Sep 1796. The amazing
aspect of this branch of the Wiggs family tree, on both the paternal
and maternal sides, is that it was DC-Maryland centered for
generations.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Now, the Dorneys had
a daughter, Maria Agnes, who married Benjamin Thomas Watson of Prince
Georges County, Maryland. They, in turn, had a daughter, Susannah
Cecelia, who became Edna&rsquo;s mother. Susan, as she was called,
was the youngest of nine in a family of seven girls and two boys. In
due course she married Edna&rsquo;s father, Johnson Eliot Wright, son
of Benjamin C. Wright, who was born in Alexandria, VA, when it was
still part of the District of Columbia. Edna&rsquo;s father had a
great uncle, Robert Wright, who was Provost Marshal of Bladensburg
during the Civil War. Robert had inherited a gold watch as the then
eldest survivor of another Wright which was inscribed: &ldquo;<i>Prescribed
to ------ Wright </i><i>b</i><i>y General Lafayette, for taking care
of him while he was wounded</i>.&rdquo; Edna&rsquo;s father had
another great uncle, Judge James Wright, who was Chief Librarian of
the Department of Justice. As for himself, &ldquo;father&rdquo;
Wright had served in the Finance Branch of the War Department. Upon
retirement, a formal testimonial acclaimed him to be &ldquo;a
Christian and a polished gentleman of the old school, very loyal, and
an assiduous worker.&rdquo; He was also a good husband, and together
with Susan spawned eight children, six girls and two boys, of which
our Edna was the eldest. In his retirement, he became the secretary
for the <i>Ass</i><i>o</i><i>ciation of the Oldest Inhabitants of DC</i>,
a position in which he continued his &ldquo;loyalty&rdquo; and
&ldquo;assiduous&rdquo; working habits until his death.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Before moving on,
mention must be made of Edna&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s older brother,
Herbert. He began work at 16 as a telegrapher for the Baltimore and
Ohio RR, where he eventually rose to become Chief Operator. He next
switched to Western Union as chief night operator of its Washington
office. Then followed a brief stint with United Press. From there he
moved on to become a telegrapher in the Adjutant General&rsquo;s
Office of the War Department, where he became renowned as &ldquo;the
best and fastest&rdquo; in the city. He would eventually complete 30
years of government service, including being in charge of the cable
and telegraph work of the entire military establishment, including
the coding/decoding of official cipher messages. Much of the latter
traffic during WWI was, of course, &ldquo;of the highest national
importance.&rdquo; Because of his efficiency and expertise, his
tenure was extended for three consecutive two year terms beyond the
then mandatory retirement age of 70. Surely such performance is a
proper matter of family pride and warrants this brief memorial
paragraph. Now, back to our story.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">In sharp contrast to
the geographical stability of the Wright clan, so deeply rooted in
the general area of the nation&rsquo;s capital (and a tradition from
which Edna was to deviate with happy results that shall bear on the
substance of our story), the Wiggs clan persisted in its nomadic
heritage. We pick up the thread of this tribal evolution with Al&rsquo;s
grandfather, Matthew Wigglesworth (1794-1873) who migrated from
Liverpool, England, via Canada, to Palmyra, New York. There is no
accounting for how this shoemaker so directly descended from English
nobility happened initially to settle in this small village, of less
than 4,000 inhabitants, located on the Barge Canal south east of
Rochester in west central New York. (Joseph Smith also lived in
Palmyra, and published the <i>Book of </i><i>M</i><i>orm</i><i>o</i><i>n</i>
there.) Not to worry, the Wiggs didn&rsquo;t remain there long.
Somewhere along the way Matt married an Elizabeth Hudson, said to be
related to <i>the</i> Henry Hudson. For our purposes, at least, their
crowning achievement was son Thomas Hudson Wigglesworth, Al&rsquo;s
father.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">With the advent of
Tom Wigglesworth at Palmyra on 31 Jul 1835 this story really (we
sincerely hope) &ldquo;takes off&rdquo; at last, and your
interlocutor at once suffers an embarrassment of riches with respect
to source material. The simple fact is, Tom Wigglesworth was quite a
man! Our fervent hope is that we may do proper justice to his truly
frontier&rsquo;s-man character. The latter was quick to reveal
itself. He ran away from home at age 13, all the way to Kentucky.
Though he would never grow to be a big man, even as a youngster he
was evidently both sturdy and audacious, becoming an axeman for the
Louisville and Nashville RR. He was also observant and ambitious, and
so returned to New York at 19 to study trigonometry in order to
become an engineer. Then it was back south again, this time to
Tennessee. It was at Fountain Head, TN, that he met Ann Spradlin,
whom he married on 14 May 1863. They would have seven offspring,
numbering five boys (including their last child who would survive
only two years in Colorado) and two girls. Al would be the fifth
child and third son. Perhaps his placement in the middle of this
considerable constellation of &ldquo;kinder-folk&rdquo; accounts for
his calm, moderate and totally balanced temperament and uncommon
humility.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">As for Al&rsquo;s
brothers and sisters, not too much is known, except for younger
sister Emily Elizabeth (later Mrs W. H. Howard of Animas City, CO,
whom we shall meet again briefly incident to the introduction of the
first <i>Silver Vista</i> observation coach on the Durango-Silverton
RR run on 22 Jun 1947), and brother William Hudson Wigglesworth and
his son James. Hill was born in Parksville, KY in 1866, and traveled
to Durango with his parents in 1881 where he died in 1946. At various
times in the interim he held nearly every public office in Durango
and La Plata county, serving as Durango city manager for 14 years,
and as city and county engineer, Magistrate and justice of the peace.
During his colorful engineering career he also spent time in New
Mexico, Arizona, Florida and Mexico. He worked on the construction of
the Durango-Silverton RR run and later as surveyor on the Crystal
River RR in Pitkin county. Then followed two winters in Chihuahua,
Mexico, on the RR from Juarez toward the Sierra Madre mountains. He
also surveyed Indian allotments and irrigation canals around Ignacio,
CO, and the Perin&rsquo;s Peak RR.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">He went to AZ in
1910 for four years surveying Indian allotments to the Papago. He
also did a stint as mill man at a gold mine, and assistant city
engineer in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, eventually returning to Durango where
he surveyed the water system which serves the city even today, and
also built the Narraguinnep Reservoir north of Cortez. The nomadic
instinct of their Norseman-Norman heritage clearly lived on through
Tom and sons Bill and Al Wigglesworth. These fellows really got
around. So did Bill&rsquo;s son, Major James Wigglesworth. A graduate
engineer, he served nine years in the state highway department. Then,
after extensive military training in OK, KS and MS, Jim saw four
years service beginning in Jan 1945 as a ground liaison officer with
the 7th and Patton&rsquo;s 3rd Armies in France, Germany, and
Austria, penetrating to the Enns river link-up with the Russians.
With the peace he reverted to Augsburg, Bavaria, where he was charged
with feeding, housing, and relocating displaced persons &ndash; an
experience that would stand him in good stead following his
discharge. He returned to Durango to become city manager in Jan 1946,
following in his Dad&rsquo;s footsteps. And, as with Dad&rsquo;s
footsteps, Jim&rsquo;s soon started spreading out. After five years,
he resigned his Durango post to become city manager of Russell, KS,
at a substantially larger salary. The pioneering spirit apparently
dies hard.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Meanwhile, and
before dealing with the remarkable engineering feats of old Tom
Wiggs, what do we know about his wife, Ann Spradlin? (Hey! You can&rsquo;t
tell the players without a score card. Maybe you should be taking
notes.) Well, as we&rsquo;ve mentioned, Tom caught up with her in TN,
but before going forward, we had best take a short look backward. On
the paternal side of Ann&rsquo;s family tree there is a dearth of
information. We only know that her father&rsquo;s name was John, and
that he married Emily Hodges on 22 May 1839. We are a sprite more
fortunate with respect to the maternal side of her family ancestry.
Emily Hodges was said to be a cousin of Henry Clay. Beyond that, we
are able to trace back two more generations to an Elizabeth Clay
married to an Isham Hodges (born 18 May 1763). They owned 600 acres
in Henry county, VA (on the southern border, on a line between
Roanoke and Greensboro). Regrettably, this attractive if modest
estate was confiscated by the government, since Isham unaccountably
remained a British citizen. So, all Isham really &ldquo;left&rdquo;
(and his will of 14 May 1782 is still on file and suitably inscribed
with &ldquo;his mark&rdquo;) was 11 children. Finally, we know that
Ann Spradlin died in Durango on 19 Dec 1934, (Whew! <i>It&rsquo;s
Miller tim</i><i>e!</i>) Now, we can proceed with the story of Tom
(and then Al) Wigglesworth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">We left off with Tom
in KY after completing his math studies in NY, and we noted his
marriage and the subsequent spawning of his seven children. Now, let
us take up Tom&rsquo;s engineering career, which was largely
performed in the service of our then still expanding RR system. Son
William recorded (<i>Pathfinders of the San Juan Country</i> &ndash;
Vol III) that the early history of the RRs of the San Juan Basin
(most of which were Tom&rsquo;s work) was eloquent testimony to Tom&rsquo;s
legerdemain as RR location and construction engineer. He went on to
recount that Tom started his career in a RR working party under his
older brother John around Fountain Head, TN. John was location and
construction engineer for the Louisville and Tennessee RR. During the
Civil War Tom served as a freight conductor on that road. When the
war was over and RR building was resumed, Tom returned to his first
work and rapidly advanced from axeman to rodman, and then to
instrument man. Then he was appointed location and construction
engineer for the Knoxville branch of the Louisville &amp; Nashville
RR. After service with several RRs around Parksville, Elizabethtown
and Louisville, KY, Tom answered the call of the West, and took off
to check out the Black Hills of SD in 1877.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">He then returned to
his homeland for a brief respite, but by 1878 he was back in the West
to stay, and working for the Denver and Rio Grande RR. It was then
that his reputation as a pioneer RR locating and construction
engineer was really made, beginning with his settling in around
Durango, CO, where he was to die on 16 Mar 1909. He established some
600 miles of track in this mountainous southwest CO area, including
putting the first narrow gauge line into the Rockies, and the
surveying of the famous Moffatt tunnel (a 6.4 mile tube at 9,100 feet
across the Continental Divide and piercing James Peak WNW of Denver),
which was completed in 1922-27 after his death. As Chief Engineer he
also put in the lines from Durango to Mancos and Dolores, and from
Colorado Springs to Cripple Creek and to Leadville, of which latter
he said, &ldquo;Other engineers said it couldn&rsquo;t be done, but
there it is.&rdquo; Incidentally, Cripple Creek once surrendered $25
million in gold in one year. In the early 1980&rsquo;s it was
reactivated when a steep rise in gold prices made mining there
profitable once again. Leadville, formerly Oro (Gold) City, is the
highest (over 10,000 feet) incorporated city in the USA. Gold in its
California Gulch attracted 5,000 people into a five mile strip there
within four months in 1860.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">You may have noted
that we said that Tom settled in at Durango in 1878, whereas we
reported earlier how son Bill (and presumably the rest of the family)
went west with Tom in 1881. Actually, Al&rsquo;s memoirs will clear
up this seeming discrepancy. (Be patient! We promise that we <i>shal</i><i>l</i>
get to them, and soon!) What happened was that the family joined Tom
(who had preceded them to CO) in the spring of 1881. A complicating
factor was that Durango (a name strangely of Moorish origin and
meaning concourse or meeting place) was not established until 1880.
Be that as it may, and thanks largely to Tom Wiggs and the RR, a
concourse it certainly became. In the halcyon period of 1900-1912 it
had four RRs converging from the four cardinal points of the compass.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Now, you might say
that Durango and the RR were almost a &ldquo;chicken and egg&rdquo;
proposition as to which came first, but you would be wrong (and in
any event the Wiggs clan would have been on hand for the greeting).
Actually, it was RR policy simply to bypass non-cooperative towns,
leaving them to wither and die, even as new towns along the chosen
route were, as was Durango, actually <i>designed</i> by the RR. In
fact, the present day Animas City (two miles north of Durango on the
Durango-Silverton run) is the second so-named city, the first (15
miles north of Durango) having been supplanted thereby through RR
manipulation. The D&amp;RG<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote15anc" href="#sdfootnote15sym"><sup>15</sup></a>
was perfectly willing to work with charitably disposed communities.
This might mean the donation of a right-of-way or a depot site, the
purchase of RR stock, or even help in grading part of the line. If
such aid was not forthcoming, the RR just proceeded to establish a
rival community. Such is the alleged <i>American </i><i>W</i><i>ay</i>.
&ldquo;Animas City,&rdquo; by the way, is really a sort of shorthand
for the full name of the river for which it is named &ndash; <i>R</i><i>iver
</i><i>of</i><i> Souls Lost In Purgatory</i> &ndash; which in itself
gives you as good an idea as anything else of the tortuous, testing
nature of that formidable territory.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Durango (1986 pop. &ndash;
11,400), variously called the <i>Sagebrush Metropolis</i>, the <i>M</i><i>agic
Metr</i><i>o</i><i>p</i><i>o</i><i>lis</i>, the &ldquo;Denver of
Southern Colorado,&rdquo; and even more accurately &ldquo;the child
of the RR,&rdquo; really (as with other settlements in the area) owed
its existence to the gold and silver found in the San Juan Mountains.
(The heavily mined 14,150-foot Mt. Sneffels yielded $35 million in
gold and silver by 1889.) It&rsquo;s future was assured when the San
Juan &amp; New York Smelter was relocated there from Silverton in
1880. Durango was not itself a conventional frontier town. It was a
miracle of &ldquo;instant urbanization.&rdquo; It had three
newspapers by 1881, which is two more than the capital city of the
leading nation of the free world &ndash; Washington DC &ndash; had in
1981. And these weren&rsquo;t light-weight entries common to many
boom-towns. In fact, one of the area papers (nearby Ouray&rsquo;s
<i>S</i><i>olid Muldoon</i>) counted Queen Victoria of England among
its subscribers. Typical of its prosperity and sophistication was a
Christmas newspaper ad of the period: <i>Fur-get and fur-giv</i><i>e!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Of course, Durango
also suffered the maladies of most fast-growing mining towns:
shortages, high prices, lawlessness, violence &ndash; and the
ubiquitous female &ldquo;prospectors&rdquo; whom they called <i>shady
</i><i>l</i><i>adies of the eighties</i>. In Durango they occupied a
two-block strip between the RR spur and the Animas river. The houses
included the <i>Variety Theatre</i>, the <i>Silver Bell</i>, the
<i>Clipper</i>, the <i>Hanging Gardens of Babylon</i> &ndash; a
curious name for the only one devoted to lynch-conscious blacks, and
simply <i>B</i><i>essie&rsquo;s</i>, <i>Jennie&rsquo;s</i>, <i>Hattie&rsquo;s</i>,
and <i>Nel</i><i>li</i><i>e&rsquo;s</i>. More generously, they all
went under the euphemism of &ldquo;dance halls.&rdquo; Indicative of
the times is an epitaph found upon a tombstone in nearby Ouray
(&ldquo;Your-A&rdquo; &ndash; for a famous multi-lingual Ute Indian
chief), thus:</p>

<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Notorious neighbors
and visitors from nearby Creede (68 miles to the northeast) included
Robert Ford, Martha Cannary and William Barclay Masterson. You say
they don&rsquo;t ring a bell? How quickly we forget. Ford was the
bozo who shot Jesse James in the back and got a dose of the same for
his trouble 10 fearful years later. As for Martha, perhaps you&rsquo;d
recall her more easily as <i>Calamity Jane</i>. Bat Masterson, of
course was the legendary non-gun-drawing peace officer imported to
bring law and order to Silverton before moving on to New York as a
newspaperman. More recently, attention has been drawn to the area by
artist/rancher Fred Harman, originator of the comic strip <i>Red
Ryder</i>. Then there was Alferd (sic) Packer, the sole survivor of a
six man trek into the San Juan Mountains in the winter of 1873. With
the Spring thaw, Packer was found guilty of murder and cannibalism.
Years later the whimsical students at the University of Colorado
would vote to name their dining hall the <i>Alferd E. Packer Grill</i>.
So it goes&hellip;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">By now you may have
forgotten that this is purported to be the saga of the Wigglesworth
clan. Remember, though, that you were warned at the outset of this
segment that we confronted a wealth of material. Anyhow, you surely
must now have a much better feel for and flavor of the times and the
territory, and that&rsquo;s the whole point of the immediately
preceding mish-mash. It was sort of a stage setting for the scene
into which our central hero, Doctor Al, would be introduced at age 9
in 1881. Before moving on to Al, however, we should complete the
dossier on his father, Tom. (Even so, we shall reserve to the next
chapter the story of what we shall choose to regard as Tom&rsquo;s
crowning engineering achievement &ndash; the locating and
construction of the D&amp;RG&rsquo;s Durango-Silverton line in
1881-82.) Let us begin our summing up by simply quoting in full his
biography from the <i>Biographical Directory of Railway Officials of

his chosen work, he made his appearance in Colorado in 1879. He spent

om. Vest Day tells of a survey crew crossing the AZ desert with no
way to measure the mileage. Wigglesworth tied a can to the buggy

counting the bangs of the can as it hit the ground. The number of

&ldquo;nipper&rdquo; on the railroad from Eureka to Animas Forks. He
was only a young lad and had to carry heavy tools from the graders to
the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop for sharpening and then carry them back
to the graders. Mr. Wigglesworth told him he&rsquo;d have to let him

<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Well, <i>Old Wig</i>
must by now be coming into somewhat sharper focus in your mind&rsquo;s
eye, but we still haven&rsquo;t taken full measure of this hearty
railroad pioneer. As Isadora Duncan wrote in her autobiography,
&ldquo;There is the vision our friends have of us; the vision we have
of ourselves: and the vision our lover has of us. Also, the vision
our enemies have of us &ndash; all of these visions are different.&rdquo;
Amen! There can be no doubt that <i>O</i><i>ld </i><i>W</i><i>ig</i>
pleased his main boss, the redoubtable Otto Mears, since the latter
kept re-hiring him. And, Otto was a rugged individualist of the first
order who demanded of his key employees exactly what he demanded of
himself &ndash; <b>everything</b> &ndash; total commitment <i>plus!</i>
(He once built a lumber mill with no other tool than a hand saw &ndash;
and <i>n</i><i>o</i> nails! He scratched out 450 miles of toll roads
in the San Juan Mountains, of which perhaps the most famous is the
so-called <i>M</i><i>illion Dollar Highway</i>. Natives cheerfully
debate as to whether the name derives from its original construction
from mine ore leavings, the huge cost of rebuilding it to accommodate
modern vehicular traffic, or in testimony to its breath-taking
scenery. Linking Silverton and Ouray, it is one of the most
spectacular auto routes in the nation. Popularly known today as US
550, it is really only the straight six mile stretch overlying the
original toll road.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Otto also fulfilled
a government mail route commitment, personally when need be, through
biting sub-zero temperatures, heavy snows, near tornado level winds
and soft spring slush that could engulf a man to his armpits. He was
the money angel and driving force of the D&amp;RG. (Curiously, Otto&rsquo;s
only RR venture east of CO was the construction of the now defunct
Washington DC-Chesapeake Beach MD Railway.) Tom Wigglesworth was
Otto&rsquo;s kind of man&rsquo;s man. But <i>Old </i><i>W</i><i>ig</i>
also had the respect and admiration of his employees down the line.
However varied the perspective, from whatever angle you look at him,
Tom Wiggs comes off well. For proof, we here excerpt an article by
George Vest Day, <i>The Pathfinder of the San Juan &ndash; As Crew
Members Remember Him, from Pioneers of the San Juan Country</i> &ndash;

that now we might all easily recognize the man if it were only
possible ta meet him. Beyond that, the probability is strong that we
should all have wished to meet him and would have enjoyed such a
meeting &ndash; all of which prompts a few reflections on the value
and lessons of biography. Culling through the personal histories of
those who preceded us, whether family or not, we become ever more
aware of the continuity and kinship of all humanity. We&rsquo;re all
part, after all, of a single giant tapestry of life. At the same
time, we become keenly aware of how fleeting life is, and are
increasingly impressed that we too shall pass from this earthly
scene. Finally, and happily, there is the merest hint for hope &ndash;
precisely through biography &ndash; that somehow, in fact, we shall
live on.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Having proposed a
fitting epitaph for Thomas Hudson Wigglesworth, let us now salute his
most lasting monument &ndash; the Durango-Silverton Railway. Unique
in its conception and execution, this 45 mile spur of track is
equally unique in its longevity. It is today the only fully ICC
regulated, 100% coal-fired, narrow gauge railway remaining in the
United States, and (save for mountain slides, floods and blizzard
snows) has been in scheduled continuous service since 1882,
celebrating its first 100 years of operations on 13 Jul 1982. As the
monument at the Cascade Canyon wye (the 26 mile-post) implies, the
&ldquo;Spirit of Colorado Mountain Railroading&rdquo; is embodied in
this short but tortuous line. No finer monument to any railroad man
exists anywhere, nor could one even be imagined.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">In 1879, Tom
Wigglesworth, then Otto Mears crack location engineer, arrived on
site by burro pack train, the surest and safest way over the
mountains embracing the area. His preliminary survey reached the
Animas valley from Silverton on 8 Oct 1879. The next morning an
unprecedented three-foot snow covered the ground and his party fought
its way to Animas City where they camped during the night. Tom then
returned to complete his construction chores in Antonito, but was
back surveying the Durango- Silverton run in the early Spring of
1880, as soon as the weather permitted. Construction work was begun
at once, although the location survey was not completed until Jul
1881. Track laying was finished at Silverton in Jul 1882.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">The train traverses
a remote wilderness area of rare and majestic beauty, part of the San
Juan National Forest, following the Animas River gorge. This area is
only accessible by railroad, horseback or on foot. Scenes for many
Hollywood films about the west have been enriched by its lush but
rugged grandeur, notably Mike Todd&rsquo;s <i>Ar</i><i>o</i><i>und
The World In 80 Days</i>, and the movie <i>Ticket To Tomahawk</i>
featuring Dan Dailey. Other films shot in part on location in the
area include: <i>Across The Wide Missour</i><i>i</i>, <i>Night
Passage</i>, <i>Naked Spur</i>, <i>The Denver &amp; The Rio Grande</i>,
and <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i>. It is the genuine
locale of the truly Wild West. No doubt most modern day, city-soft
Americans would concede, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice place to visit, but
I wouldn&rsquo;t want to live there.&rdquo; It is only through Tom
Wiggs&rsquo; path-finding railroad that they are even offered the
option.</p>

How did the engineering marvel known as the Durango-Silverton Railway
come to be anyway? Where does one even began to tell this fascinating
story? Well, to give credit where credit is due, we shall rely mainly
on three excellent sources: Zeke and Russ Wigglesworth&rsquo;s <i>Ride
The High Iron To Yesterday</i> from <i>Trek Along The Navajo Trail</i>;
Doris Osterwald&rsquo;s mile-by-mile guide to the railway entitled,
<i>Cinders &amp; Smoke</i>; and Allen Nossaman&rsquo;s excellent
piece, <i>The D&amp;RG Finally Makes It T</i><i>o</i><i> Silverton</i>
in the 100th RR Anniversary issue of <i>The Silverton Standard &amp;
The </i><i>M</i><i>iner</i> &ndash; the longest surviving paper (from
1875) west of the Continental Divide. Given this rich vein to mine, a
problem still remains as to where to begin. Perhaps it is only
fitting that we start with the material authored by folks named
Wigglesworth (two of Tom&rsquo;s great grandsons,) thus:</p>

(at that time there were some 27 active mines within a 2-1/2 by 1-1/2
mile area,) and it was also the year the RR cane up from Durango. The
D&amp;RG was quite a system, and its eventual consolidation with the
Rio Grande Western was probably the most important factor in
Colorado&rsquo;s economy except mining. {$300 million in gold and
silver rode this 45 miles.)</b></font></font></p>

<font face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><b>A
few years before all this, a wealthy and well-known evaluator of men,
mountains and railroad tracks, Otto Mears, decided a railroad should
be built southward from Silverton to haul away the ore. Looking for
men with the knowledge, experience and courage, he decided on a man
he&rsquo;d met and worked with before, Thomas H. Wigglesworth. The
choice was apparently a good one. Even then, railroads all over the
United States had wound their ways through his figures and across his
maps in KY, CO, TN and UT. And, the Silverton was going to get rough
before it was finished. It was obviously a choice for narrow gauge
track &ndash; the only rail that could be pushed through the Animas
Canyon. [<i>Obvious?</i> Perhaps to the authors. The infinitely
cheaper sub-standard gauge (three feet as opposed to the normal four
feet and eight and one-half inches) meant a less wide cut had to be
blasted through narrow granite-walled canyons; less wide grades had
to be built-up across vast and deep gorges; less heavy rolling stock
would be used, which also abetted conquering steeper grades (an
unusual 2-1/2% maximum here, although Tom had encountered
unbelievable 4% grades out of Antonito through Cumbres Pass into
Chama), and permitted less sturdy bridges, and sharper and less
expansive curves (although up to 30% curves were accommodated)
following wildly meandering canyons could be more readily
negotiated.] A track from Silverton to the smelter south of Durango
was the answer for which the men at the nines were waiting. [Closed
in 1930, this smelter was re-opened during WWII to handle vanadium
(used to obtain finer grain steels with improved tensile strength)
and uranium &ndash; for you know what.]</b></font></font></p>

<font face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><b>Selecting
a route north from Durango was simple [the authors volunteer]: just
follow the canyon of the Animas River. A few minor [?] problems, of
course. How push the track through the narrow canyon near Rockwood?
How build the roadbed so the river won&rsquo;t wash it out? What
about snow in the winter? Three times the track went out on the
highline above Rockwood before rails, ties, boulders, dirt and human
sweat pegged it to the cliff-side. In places, the bed is so narrow
that you get the impression of flying, because the track and the
roadbed cannot be seen from the coach. [North from Rockwood the
so-called highline was the most difficult and costly section of the
Silverton to construct &ndash; $100,000 per mile.] The 900 foot
Rockwood Cut took hundreds of carefully placed black powder shots &ndash;
some drill holes are still visible from the train &ndash; to blast
clear. Ernest Ingersoll of <i>Harper&rsquo;s</i> again details the
dividends: &ldquo;Finally, we jolt down the last steep declivity,
turn a sharp corner and roll out upon the level railroad bed. And
what a sight meets our eyes! The bed has been chiseled out of solid
rock until there is made a shelf or ledge wide enough for its rails.
From far below comes the roar of a rushing stream, and we gaze
fearfully over the beetling edge which the coach rocks so perilously
near, down to where a bright green current urges its way between
walls of basalt whose jetty hue no sunlight relieves, and upon whose
polished sides no jutting point would give any floating thing an
instant&rsquo;s hold.&rdquo; [Old Ernie always did have a way with
words!]</b></font></font></p>

wouldn&rsquo;t quit</i> (from 1860), and the headwaters of the Rio

miles south of Silverton Snowden Peak rises to more than 13,000 feet.

researching her <i>Cinders &amp; Smoke</i>. The further opinion is
there ventured that few if any pictures of the camps survive because
builders didn&rsquo;t want prospective investors and stockholders to
see the wild terrain and primitive living conditions surrounding the
building of these lines, since Easterners were probably already
overly disposed to regard such mountain endeavors impossible of
success. After a line was completed, of course, publicity pictures
were welcome. In any event, Allen Nossaman&rsquo;s newspaper article

proudly and patiently awaiting its destiny, was in dire need of a
boost when the D&amp;RG finally worked its way up the River of Lost
Souls In Purgatory [so called because the area was &ldquo;so hard to
get into, and so hard to get out of&rdquo; in the summer of 1882. The
town had been struggling for eight years as one of the highest, and
definitely the most remote, of the Colorado mining camps in the
post-statehood [1876] era. Since the community&rsquo;s platting in
1874, a hardy handful of prospectors and merchants had held forth in
9,320 foot high Baker Park [Silverton&rsquo;s original name] awaiting
some viable link with the markets they knew existed for the ores they
uncovered&hellip; At its founding, Silverton&rsquo;s closest rail
point was Pueblo &ndash; 250 miles away by the most favorable route
[while during its halcyon period of 1900-12 it marked the confluence
of four RR lines]&hellip; Old timers felt certain the RR would take
the tried and true route into Silverton over the Continental Divide
at Stony Pass &ndash; even the first piano had come that way. [In
fact, the D&amp;RG (like the Ford Motor Co. of the 1970&rsquo;s) &ldquo;had
a better idea.&rdquo; They proposed to use the Animas Canyon, and
continue on south, deep into New Mexico, to effect the link-up
there.]</b></font></font></p>

at a little settlement named Animas City. [Sadly, as recounted
earlier, the city fathers and the D&amp;RG failed to see eye-to-eye,
so the city was by-passed, the RR effectively digging its grave with
every shovel full of dirt turned at its brand new town of Durango.]
Grading started north of Animas City as early as Feb 1880, and &hellip;
arrival in Silverton was joyously predicted everywhere from Oct 1880
to Aug 1881. As the [southern link-up] RR literally inched across the
Continental Divide at Cumbres Pass [just about on the CO/NM border
directly north of Albuquerque] and began to turn north toward the San
Juan Basin, grading work continued in the Animas Canyon into Dec
1880, with as many as 400 men at work preparing roadbed through the
challenging canyon.</b></font></font></p>

the San Juan Mountains, and by Jul 1881, the first work train steamed

restrain its anticipation. It targeted 4 Jul 1882 for a celebration
to end all celebrations. Manpower on the grade between Rockwood and
Silverton gradually increased from 200 to 500 men as spring wore on.
[The entire distance from Rockwood to Silverton, about 25 miles, is
through a series of canyons and narrow gorges, with walls of solid
granite rising abruptly on either side from 500 to two and three
thousand feet in height. The mile of road passing through the grand
canyon of the Animas, immediately above Rockwood, is a miracle of
engineering skill and audacity; and presents probably the grandest
scenery on the American Continent. The traveler&rsquo;s eyes at once
sweep up the massive walls from near the river level, then down

<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">With some reluctance
we must now conclude this tribute with a rather whimsical postscript.
<i>Old Wig</i> may well have spun in his grave in Aug 82 if aware at
all that one of the cars on &ldquo;his train&rdquo; had run off the
track while his grandson Jack and wife Virginia were aboard with a
Smithsonian group touring the old mines and railroads of CO.
Naturally, to make matters worse, Jack was in the very process of
proudly proclaiming how his grandfather had almost single-handedly
been responsible for the path-finding and building of the marvel that
was and remains the Durango-Silverton railroad. It seems that it
still never pays to flaunt the alleged taming of <i>Mother Nature!</i>
Now, it remains only to remark upon two other items of
Durango-Silverton RR whimsy, courtesy of traveler-writer Horace
Sutton. Mr. Sutton also made a recent run up the line. He notes that
a posted Original menu reveals that earlier riders were offered a
choice of a bowl of chili or premium Russian caviar &ndash; each at
50 cents a bowl! However, Mr. Sutton marveled even more at the modern
<i>Miner&rsquo;s </i><i>Martini</i> &ndash; 5 ounces of straight gin
in a glass &ldquo;as big as the Rockies.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">There can be no
further excuse, now, for not giving Albert Matthew Wigglesworth
center stage. Tom has had his day in the sun, and then some. And,
with the advent of Al, it is more than fitting that we pause a moment
to salute his largely unsung mother, Ann Spradlin. (She very likely
had considerable to do with it.) Actually, though, we really don&rsquo;t
have much additional hard information on Ann, but there is much that
we might safely infer from what we know of her husband and what we
shall learn of the splendid character of her children through our
study of Al.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">We must first be
impressed with the fact that in the crucial youth-raising days, when
&ldquo;the twigs were being bent&rdquo; so to speak, <i>O</i><i>ld
Wig</i> simply wasn&rsquo;t very much on the scene. A great deal of
his time was necessarily spent with his crews out at the
ever-receding rail-head. Not only that, he left Ann behind with a
bevy of seven kids! Now, seven kids is a chore and a half even in a
modern condominium. On the frontier of the early west they must have
presented a mind-boggling and body-wearying responsibility &ndash;
and Ann largely operated apparently and effectively as a &ldquo;single
parent.&rdquo; Without diminishing the respect and admiration due Tom
one wit, then, we may still shout &ldquo;Hooray for Ann!&rdquo; And,
the fact that she was blessed with seven small ones proves Tom must
have been home some of the time.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">One more thing
before formally introducing Al. We now are fairly well informed about
the state of the west of his youth, but what about the state of the
world in the early 1870&rsquo;s? In the year 1872, the year Al was
born,  Jules Verne was writing <i>Around The World In 80 Days</i>,
part of which would be filmed on the Durango-Silverton RR many years
later. Whistler was painting his mother (and we know almost as much
about his father as we do about Al&rsquo;s mother). Edison was
perfecting his duplex telegraph. Bizet was composing <i>L</i><i>&rsquo;Arigesienne</i>.
George Westinghouse was producing the first practical railway
air-brake. Fresh-born mathematician/philosopher-to-be Bertrand
Russell was still trying to make sense of two-plus-two. Aviation
pioneer Louis Bleriot was born in France. Future U.S. President Cal
Coolidge was also born that year, just as President U. S. Grant was
being re-elected. The General Amnesty Act pardoned most
ex-Confederates (if the last is not a contradiction in terms). In New
York, the Brooklyn Bridge opened. Save for a civil war in Spain and
skirmishes on our own Indian frontier, the world was relatively free
of war. All in all, it was a great time to be born. You done good,
Albert.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Now, we come at long
last to Al&rsquo;s own story. And, it&rsquo;ll not only be the story
of Al&rsquo;s life as he <i>lived</i> it, it&rsquo;ll be that story
as Al himself wrote it at age 85 in 1958<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote21anc" href="#sdfootnote21sym"><sup>21</sup></a>,
a mere three years before his death. Further, to assure that there&rsquo;ll
be no mistaking Al&rsquo;s own words, we shall from this point
signify them (except where explicitly identified to the contrary)
simply by insetting them in slightly smaller pitch type. Utilizing
this device, we won&rsquo;t have to continuously re-identify them as
we swing away from Al&rsquo;s manuscript from time to time to amplify
some omitted aspect relevant to his times. [Minor deviations will
merely be set apart by their being enclosed within brackets, within
his manuscript text, like this sentence is.]</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Now, maybe you were
expecting Al to take over at this point? <b>Wrong!</b> We have yet
one final bit of business to take care of before letting him take
charge of our narrative. Since we won&rsquo;t be meeting her until
much later in this story, and precisely because she will in due
course be such a vital part of it, we had best pause at this point to
introduce Al&rsquo;s wife-to-be, Edna Mae Wright, hereinafter Edna.
She was born in Washington DC on 8 Apr 1877, the eldest of eight
children, just two weeks short of five years after Al was born in
Louisville, KY. Almost a quarter of a century will pass before she
will link up with Al in a 1901 Christmas Eve wedding ceremony in
Durango, CO.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">So, what had been
going on in the world in this brief period separating Al and Edna&rsquo;s
births? Well, Tolstoy turned out Anna Karenina. Cezanne and Manet
were busy painting their <i>i</i><i>mpressions</i> in France. Enrico
Caruso was born. Bruckner, Brahms, Delibes, Rimsky-Korsakov and
Tchaikovsky were making music. A gunsmith named Remington began
producing something called &ldquo;typewriters,&rdquo; a guy named
Bell was inventing AT&amp;T, and American football was adopting
uniform rules. Also being born were Chaim Weizmann &ndash; first
President of Israel, Herbert Hoover, Winston Churchill, Albert
Schweitzer, the SPCA, and the first American zoo &ndash; in
Philadelphia. Writers Ibsen and Zola were busy reforming society,
Rutherford B. Hayes was being inaugurated as U.S. President, Colorado
was becoming a state and Amsterdam was building the Rijksmuseum.
Seems like only yesterday, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">In any case, the
world continued on a fairly peaceful course, and you should by now
have a little better idea of the times into which Al and Edna were
born, and who were some of their contemporaries. Truly, it was a time
that those living today (1986) know only through history books and
novels (that scene not being sufficiently sexy or violent to have yet
been much exploited on television). However, perhaps the foregoing
&ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; of the 1870&rsquo;s is sufficient to suggest
why a family of such illustrious, adventuresome stock might
reasonably have been expected to &ldquo;plight their troth&rdquo;
(whatever that is) in Durango, CO, our last <i>earthly</i> frontier,
at the turn of the century. In any event, now you have seen the
setting and met the two main characters who will generate the gist of
the balance of our story. So, at last, we surrender the thrill of the
quill, and herewith begin the verbatim incorporation of the <i>Memoirs
of Dr. Albert </i><i>M</i><i>. Wigglesworth<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote22anc" href="#sdfootnote22sym"><sup>22</sup></a></i>:</p>

was born on 22 Apr 1872 in Louisville, KY. [An item in the Memorial
Day <i>W</i><i>ashington Post</i> of 26 May 1986 recounts that Queen
Elizabeth of England, visiting KY to inspect some of her horse stock,
made her only public appearance to attend Sunday Episcopal Church

stood, she sat, she knelt, she joined in.&rdquo;] Father was then a
conductor on the Louisville and Nashville RR with a run from
Louisville to Paducah. Father had run away from home at 13 years and
worked on the survey of this same railway. He returned home at 19
years of age and there studied trigonometry as he intended to become
an engineer. Working again near Fountain Head, TN, he met my mother
at the Spradlin farm.</font></font></p>

they were married, and to them were born seven children, two girls
and five boys. A boy and a girl died in childhood. The boy was the
youngest, the girl the oldest. I was number five in order of birth.
When I was two years of age father was building a RR in the mountains
of TN. Although I could walk, they put me in the charge of a colored
boy. It came to pass that I was put to bed with a fever. The fever,
with very possibly the oozing of blood from the bowel, induced the
old backwoods doctor to call it a case of typhoid fever.</font></font></p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Well,
I grew up with this diagnosis of typhoid fever. When at medical
school, the surgeon examined my crippled hip, for it struck me that
the typhoid diagnosis was incorrect. Mother finally said that the
colored boy that took care of me was caught tossing me up and
catching me, and that she called him down for so doing. Accepting
that as the cause of the fractured and dislocated end of the left
femur, it seemed so evident that nothing could be done that an X-ray
seemed unnecessary. About 1930, I developed some rectal trouble.</font></font></p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">By
feeling around the anus, a scar through the muscle was found which
impaired the power of the external sphincter which allowed a small
prolapse of the bowel. Then I had the X-ray man make a film. It
showed the head of the femur forward and fractured and also out of
the original socket, although an attempt by nature had made a shallow
one above. A fall on the hip would have broken the head back. Force
from above, with a struggle, and the torn sphincter made a diagnosis
of rape by the negro youth a possibility. Fever and oozing of blood
from the bowel possibly facilitated the faulty diagnosis of typhoid
fever but still showed careless examination. [Notice the cool, calm,
clinical recounting of being the subject of possible childhood rape &ndash;
with the further disastrous consequence of being a life-long cripple!
There is not the slightest hint of any idea of recrimination,
reproach or general retribution. This affords excellent first-hand
testimony to the meek, tolerant, forgiving nature of this splendid,
uncomplaining man.]</font></font></p>

on my feet again, lameness was apparent and continues to this day.
There is now two inches shortness in the left leg when standing. The
shortness is less when lying down, due to a stretching out in virtue
of little or no hip socket. The leg itself is very much atrophied.
So, I grew up lame, and an inferiority complex naturally followed.
One saving feature was, while I could not run like other boys, I
could chin myself with either arm and they could not. Almost any boy
of ten could throw me down, so I used my fists to keep them away and
became quite a scrapper.</font></font></p>

earliest remembrance was at the age of five. We had moved back to

to be stuck on the desks. Mine read, &ldquo;For a good boy,&rdquo;
and that made me very proud. It must have been soon after this that
my parents sent me down to my grandfather&rsquo;s farm. My fondest
memories are of the farm &ndash; swinging on the long limbs of the
white oak that overhung the garden, turning the grindstone for
grandfather Spradlin, sucking cider from a straw stuck into the
barrels on the cool barn floor, hunting for hen&rsquo;s nests in the
hayloft, cooking sweet potatoes in the ashes of the fireplace, or
molding bullets from lead made liquid over the fire.</font></font></p>

grandparents had this small farm with a swamp on either side and
forests of oak, hickory, etc. They had some cows for milk and butter,
hogs for meat, and lots of chickens. Grandmother took eggs, milk and
butter to the nearby railroad station to trade for a few supplies
such as coffee, sugar and calico. They had two orchards for apples
and cider. They used the ashes from the fireplaces to get alkali for
soap. This they leached out by a wooden hopper. They raised enough
tobacco for their own needs. Grandfather chewed it, and grandmother
smoked it in a tiny clay pipe. I used to get cane for stems from down
in the swamp.</font></font></p>

taught me to bend a sapling down with a noose pegged to it to snare
rabbits; also, to build a square trap from pieces of wood built into
a pyramid for catching quail. Grandmother was busy all the time, day
and night. Grandfather had a small shop across the lane. He was a
cabinet maker and also made all of the coffins, meanwhile cutting,
hauling and chopping all the firewood. (At 12 years of age, I cut all
of the wood used in one fireplace.) At night we had only homemade
candles for light, or balls from the sycamore trees put in a cup of
lard and lighted. In cold weather the fireplace gave much light and I
often used this to study by. For toys, I had a stable in one corner
of the wooden fence on one side of the lane where I had many stick
horses made from saplings. When hungry, my delight was to run into
the log kitchen in back of the house and ask grandmother for one of
her cold soda biscuits.</font></font></p>

time to time I would visit my family in Louisville. When I returned
to the farm on the train my grandfather would meet me at the station
a few miles away. My dappled gray rocking horse was shipped down to
the farm and many a tumble I took over his head when ridden too far
and too fast. During the summers, my brothers and sisters would
sometime come down from the city, especially the boys, and we would
all go to a distant schoolhouse across a stream. On the way to the
school the older boys would climb trees and yell, &ldquo;Mad dog!&rdquo;
Not being able to climb, I would stand and bawl for their amusement.
Once coming from school I hitch-hiked on the rear end of an ox wagon
and got my great toe caught between the bed of the wagon and a wheel,
promptly losing my toenail.</font></font></p>

digress and jump ahead a few years will give me a chance to tell of
my mother&rsquo;s grandfather. When I was 12 years old, father
started on a new RR project, so mother, my two younger brothers and I
took the occasion to visit her parents in TN. My sister was in a
boarding school in Denver, and my two older brothers in a military
academy in Canon City, CO. Grandfather Meredith Hodges was a retired
Baptist preacher and lived with my grandparents on their farm near
the L&amp;N RR between Nashville and Gallatin. The old gentleman was
quite bald and a little stooped, but was lively and even rode his old
saddlehorse that was 30 years old. He did no work but sat and smoked
home grown tobacco all day long. He was 88 years old and had been a
wild young man for his illegitimate daughter came to visit him while
we were there. He gave her some money and mother explained this
situation to me. He had an old dictionary that contained obscene
words and he would point out filthy words to me and chuckle. I
resented it coming from a man of God, and anyway I was way ahead of
him, having been associated with 600 railroaders. By then I was a
tough little kid.</font></font></p>

I was nine years old, in the spring of 1881, we packed up everything
and took the train west. Father had gone on before to the Black Hills
of SD seeking RR construction and thence to CO where he made his
reputation as a pioneer RR locating engineer. He eventually had 600
miles on his location. He put the first standard gauge tracks into
the Rocky Mountains and the famous Moffatt Tunnel was his survey,
although it was not built until after his death. To save the road
from folding up from the expense he zig-zagged over the mountains.</font></font></p>

end of the RR we took west was Chama, NM, at the west foot of Poncho
Pass. There mother, my sister and youngest brother took the stage for
the hundred mile trip to Durango. My two older brothers and I climbed
aboard a big wagon loaded with sugar, canned tomatoes, hard tack,
feed for mules, bedding, wagon sheets and cooking utensils such as
frying pans, coffee pots, tin plates, and iron knives and forks. The
wagon was drawn by four big black, white-nosed mules, two at the
wheel and two in the lead. The driver, known as Ginger, the
Muleskinner, rode the left wheel mule and carried a shot-tilled
leather whip with a long lash of buckskin. He kept it coiled around
his neck, It was called a &ldquo;blacksnake.&rdquo;</font></font></p>

first night out was at a camp or rather a small town of rough
boarded-houses that had sprung up to house entertainment for the RR
laborers. We camped under the edge of the mesa and beneath a tall
pine tree. The town was called Arboles. All night long we could hear
the yells of drunken men and the screams of dissolute women. Time
after time, bullets would whizz through the limbs of the pine. It was
said that at least one man was killed each night.</font></font></p>

think it was the next day that we tried to ford the San Juan River

river and helped up the wheel mule on the right and we got across.
Next morning Ginger was afraid to try another ford, so he and the
boys got on the mules and rode off to see if a road could be found up
the mesa. I cried to be taken along, but to no avail. This went on
for several days until a road was completed. Left alone, I had
nothing to do save hurl pebbles and stones into the river. Although
it was April, the sun at noon was hot and the wagon sheets gave
little shade. Our next stop was at a sawmill in the tall Ponderosa
pines. I remember the cook took a fancy to me [which may explain how
Al came to take over all cooking chores after he and Edna were
married] and I watched him put a gunny bag of salt fish in the little
stream that ran by and draw up a leg of beef to the top of a pine
tree, out of reach of the green flies. He also had a sorrel [a
red-yellow brown] donkey. This was my first contact with a burro.
[For city-bred readers, a burro is a small donkey or ass, smaller
than a horse, whereas a mule is a hybrid, the offspring of a male ass
and a mare. The donkey is slow and sure-footed that makes a fine pack
animal.] I rode him hour after hour up and down the trail to the
camp. I was very careful not to stray too far.</font></font></p>

more comes to mind until we arrived in Durango. The company house and
office was in a low building near the track with a high board corral
and stables behind it. They had started to build the RR from both
ends, Chama and Durango. We joined the family and were driven 25
miles north to Camp One [probably at what is now known as <i>Tall
Timber Resort</i>] on the way to Silverton. Father was resident
engineer on this line from Durango to Silverton, and McMurtrie was
chief engineer over all the D&amp;RG and Western. About 25 miles from
Durango the RR enters the Animas Canyon and the difficult port of
entry had to be blasted from the canyon wall. In a little pocket on
the mountain side was Camp One. The laborers were in tents near the
canyon wall. We were so close to the blasting that when they yelled
&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; we ran under the logs across the roof of the
cabin and the rock would splatter down on the roof.</font></font></p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Mother
and the cook&rsquo;s wife were the only women in camp. The cook&rsquo;s
wife, Mrs. Billy Cole, was only 16 years old and had come all the way
from Ireland to marry Billy. [It is so typical of perfect gentleman
Al that he would refer to the cook by his first name, but defer to
the cook&rsquo;s young wife as &ldquo;<i>M</i><i>rs</i>. Cole.&rdquo;]
There were several assistant cooks, and they cooked under a large
tent on large stoves fired by wood. The dining tent was larger, and
had many rough planked tables, tin plates, and iron knives, forks and
spoons. I would go down to the cook&rsquo;s tent for a hunk of bread
filled with currants or a handful of dried currants. Out in front of
our cabin was a large circular wall about seven feet in diameter and
six feet high. What it was for, I do not know &ndash; maybe for
refuse, as it was over 1000 feet deep, down to water through granite.
There was a small pond-like well of rainwater in back of the cabin
where cottontails and willows grew. Missing my four year old brother
one day, we looked into the well and there he was. He grinned up at
us and said, &rdquo;I jumped down.&rdquo;</font></font></p>

had a fine time when the burro train took supplies up the canyon to
other camps. Riding back of the pack going up, I had an empty saddle
coming back. Sometimes, by tying my mount to a tree and letting the
train go by for a distance, the maddened animal would run at high
speed when released. Along the grade and near the edge we would fly.
Had he stumbled over the edge this would never have been written.</font></font></p>

casualties come to mind. One was that of a man who built a-pen of
dynamite near a rock wall, forgetting the reflected heat from a fire
he built to thaw out his powder. They never found even a rivet from
his Levis after the explosion. Another poor fellow fell from a foot
bridge near where the river entered the gorge, and the rocks and
current tore him to pieces. I had the run of all the tents and in the
evenings would go around smoking the laborers pipes, playing cards
and listening to coarse stories. At ten years of age I had become a
really tough kid. I had quite a collection of nickels and dimes given
to me by the laborers, as they would not buy anything. Whiskey was
cheap, however. I also had a collection of small pistols.</font></font></p>

the west of our camp, up a steep hill, the stage coach went by
enroute from Silverton to Durango. Father thought a boy should be
kept busy, so he sent me up to this road to throw the stones out of
the ruts in the road. I worked a while and then came down and said I
was scared because a snake winked at me. I really did see the snake.</font></font></p>

RR almost completed, we moved to Durango, a wide open town. My older
brothers got jobs soon after we arrived there, so that when the first
train went from Durango to Silverton up the Animas Canyon, father and
mother, my sister Lizzie, my brother Jack, and a Mr. and Mrs. Colson
and I were the first passengers. The train was stopped at a point
where the train enters the canyon and we all got out. I rolled a few
stones down into the raging Animas River below. Lizzie made the trip
again at 91 years of age. Now all are dead as I write this at 89
years of age [in 1961]. In my lifetime the Durango-Silverton narrow
gauge route has become a world famous tourist attraction.</font></font></p>

mentioned earlier, in the Fall of 1883 mother and we three younger
children visited the old Spradlin farm in TN and I really became
attached to it. I believe I also mentioned how my cabinet-maker
grandfather also made all the coffins, and I often watched him saw
and plane the wood. I had a small three pound axe which we called a
squaw <font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">axe</font></font>
out West. With it I cut all the wood we and mother used in the front
room given over to us. A terrible hurricane blew down a lot of apple
trees in the orchard, and grandfather and I cut them up for firing. I
let my axe slip while resting it on a downed tree and cut my right
instep. We got the boot off and-stopped the bleeding, but that instep
has remained higher than the left.</font></font></p>

the Spring of 1884 we returned to Durango where I was reunited with
my beloved burros which contractor Keegan had given me. With other
kids we roamed the hills around town, climbed in the rafters at the
sawmill sheds, and at night would sometimes hide behind the huge
granite boulders at the lower end of town. We&rsquo;d drive a nail
over the window of the Chinese laundry, and by pulling a long cord we
could make a free nail strike the window pane. The constant
tap-tapping would enrage the Chinamen so they would fly out, curse
us, and throw flatirons at us. Behind the rocks we were safe. Durango
was a wild town, with every other door opening on a saloon. The
so-called Clipper Theatre was really a bawdy house. Gamblers, bad men
and prostitutes roamed the streets. Drunken men were a frequent
sight.</font></font></p>

days to indicate a drug store. That made a blue color with water, and
potassium trichromate made the orange &ndash; one globe on either
side, in the front window, each holding about 10 quarts. We lived
upstairs over the store and the druggist boarded with us. This
did-not last long, as the druggist got drunk, was fired, and father
sold out. [It&rsquo;s not mentioned, but one wonders if this brief
exposure to pharmacy might not have been the impetus which set Al

of the high mesa to the east. I would tie my burro to the bushes
while I attended school. Sometimes the citizens were afraid the Utes
were on the warpath, so the men would come to school themselves. At
other times there were rumors that Billy the Kid, or the Stocktons or
Etheridge gang were in the area, making for more excitement. Utes
frequently came into Durango dressed all in buckskin, and I loved to
sit and hear them talk. I loved the smell of sagebrush smoke on their
buckskin. One 4th of July we had horse-races and the Utes and Navajos
came with their ponies, and I know that the colored Ute interpreter,
Nigger John, had some difficulty keeping the peace. He was married to
a Ute woman and spoke Ute as well as anyone of that tribe.</font></font></p>

was black in the final struggle. Later, we moved to Colorado Springs
and I entered school there along with my sister and brother. The two
older boys still attended military school in Canon City. The Colorado
Midland was the first standard gauge RR to be built in the Rocky

$550 a month. We had a coachman and a wonderful negro woman cook.
None of us ever went up to Pike&rsquo;s Peak [14,110 feet high and
17.5 miles due west]. I remember we made the first trip over the new
RR, and the roadbed was so soft that one of the cars ran off the
rails and it was some time before it was restored in place. Soon
after this, I was sent to a Methodist Boarding School in Denver.</font></font></p>

western toughs made so much trouble that the boarding part folded up,

boarded at restaurants. While rooming at the school we found three or
four ways to get out, although we were locked up at night. One pupil
struck a professor and was dismissed. My roommate got drunk and was
expelled, and another boy was stabbed in a fight and both were
dismissed. Well, I graduated from the 8th grade and returned to

bought the Waterfall Ranch in Animas Valley [at the foot of Falls
Creek]. He had a house and a hay shed built and I worked as a hand in
the hay field and garden. The old cabin, built by the original
owners, and the log barn were still usable. The cabin was used as a
bunk house for laborers. The logs were filled with bullets fired at
the Lambert gang, and our house was just below high racks from behind
which the Sheriff was shot. Old man Lambert was sent to the
penitentiary, although it was said his son was the guilty party.
Father bought adjoining land until the home ranch had 300 acres under
cultivation. He also bought a strip in the Fall Creek Valley above us
and deeded it to me. To hold title to range property it was necessary
to have ranch property in the river bottom. We had to cross the
Animas River to reach the ranch. Once in a while our cattle would
break into a small field of some Mexican&rsquo;s ranch and we would
pay damages &ndash; according to NM Territory herd laws.</font></font></p>

purchase at only a few hundred dollars was Pinkerton Springs where
mineral water would later be bottled and a movie colony established.
[This may possibly be what is now known as Trimble Hot Springs, 1.5
miles north of the Wigglesworth Waterfall Ranch house, although the
so-called Pinkerton siding is some five miles further up the track
toward Silverton.] At odd times we went hunting, camping and fishing
on all the rivers, streams and lakes in the area. We drove our stock
high up in the mountains of Fall Creek [which current aviation charts
show to average +/- 9,000 feet in the immediate area and rising to
13,000 feet in the west]. In winter, I drove by sleigh to school in
Durango. The Durango-Silverton RR cut right through the middle of the
ranch, and one day a single locomotive came up and stopped with a
message from Otto Mears for father to start work on the Rio Grande
Southern. (This road was abandoned in 1953.) To be near the RR
headquarters, we moved to Durango and rented a large house. By
attending classes two summers I graduated from high school as
Valedictorian [usually the student first in his or her class for
scholarship, who traditionally delivers a commencement address]. My
age was then 19 and the youngest in the class was 16 years of age.</font></font></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Indeed, Al did
deliver a Valedictory on the subject of Great Caesar. It was at the
Fourth Annual Commencement of Durango High School, held in the Court
House on Thursday, 9 Jun 1892 at 8 pm (presumably Mountain Standard
Time.) The program for the occasion doesn&rsquo;t hint at when the
affair concluded, but it must have been a rather long evening. Al&rsquo;s
was the last of 18 (count &lsquo;em) orations, which were
interspersed with several musical interludes. Al&rsquo;s address
consisted of 13 finely hand-written 8x5 inch pages, carefully edited
by insertions and deletions. A few items warrant our further
attention. Al notes that old Julius chose to start out in a
profession &ldquo;which was at that time what the <i>l</i><i>aw</i>
is now, a stepping stone to political success, that is &ndash;
<i>oratory</i>.&rdquo; Again, noting that Caesar has become governor
of the rich province of Spain, Al volunteers that it was &ldquo;nearly
as good as the presidency of a railroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Al then goes on to
observe that even the name Caesar has passed down through time as
synonymous with power, as <i>C</i><i>z</i><i>ar</i> and <i>Ka</i><i>i</i><i>ser</i>
attest. Finally, remarking on Caesar&rsquo;s versatility as
originator of a new calendar, and by turns &ldquo;a soldier one day,
an orator the next, a lawyer another, and an author at all times,&rdquo;
he singles out the <i>Commentaries</i>, largely written in camp or on
the march. Al confesses, &ldquo;Some of us who have been floundering
in <i>Book One</i> are tempted to wish he had gone to bed like a
decent person instead of staying up all night writing Latin.&rdquo;
and jestingly adds, &ldquo;and why couldn&rsquo;t he have written in
plain U.S. anyhow?&rdquo; (We might well imagine Al&rsquo;s amusement
if he knew that his progenitor, William the Conqueror, couldn&rsquo;t
himself read his own totally Latin <i>Domesday Book</i>, since his
Latin tutors unaccountably kept being poisoned or stabbed to death.)
Al wisely excised the plaint that, &ldquo;It was as though he were
afraid to go to bed for fear some prowling tarantula or centipede had
preempted his blankets,&rdquo; figuring &ndash; probably quite
properly &ndash; that such an image was contrary to the one he was
otherwise at such pains to evoke. We might in any case reasonably
conclude that the long evening must have been a high-light of young
Al&rsquo;s life, as he then continues his saga on an upbeat note:</p>

quite a long time father had an interest in some cattle in NM. John
Grady, Bill Slayman, my brother Will and a Canadian we called Reuny
all were interested and ran the cattle on a mesa south of Pine River.
The holding comprised a small ranch with an adobe house near the
junction of the Pine River the San Juan. Up on the high mesa was a
log cabin and a large stake corral. A stake corral is made from cedar
posts sunk side -by-side deep in the ground, butt down and lashed
near the top with rawhide thongs or twisted cedar bark. It was a long
way down to the river, so, to obtain water, a long draw or valley was
dammed up, making a pond. To avoid the dam being washed away after
filling, a spillway was made at one side. After a hard rain or snow,
the water running down was caught to form this pond.</font></font></p>

a plow with a sod-cutter blade. We were enlarging the pond. All at
once the team ran by me to cool off in the pond. I stood at the banks
helplessly watching them bolt, forgetful of the plow they were
pulling by along chain. Suddenly Bill Slayman ran and snatched me up
else the sod-cutter would have cut off both of my legs. We drank the
water from this pond, even though it was muddy and full of bugs. The
horses and cattle waded and Wallowed in it. None of us was ever sick
from drinking the water.</font></font></p>

reached the top of the corral. His long horns were far enough apart
so that one point went on one side and one on the other of my legs.
Another time, working in a round up of the Weaver and Baker Cattle
Co., I was the horse wrangler. That is, I looked after the grazing
herd of saddle horses. It came time for me to go home and I left for
the 40 mile ride home. I was riding a slate colored Ute pony my
brother had given me. Just before reaching Pine River at a small
Mexican village, I found two of my burros &ndash; my wonderful black
Jinny and her colt. Driving them ahead, I found Pine River full to
the top of its banks. I forced the donkeys in the water and they swam
to the opposite side some 200 feet below. Guiding my pony into deep
water, I slipped off behind the saddle into the water and caught the
pony&rsquo;s tail. We were caught by the swift current but landed
safely at the same spot as the donkeys. Well, it grew too dark to
travel when we reached Horse Gulch above Durango, so I tied the
animals to aspen trees and slept in my wet saddle blankets. I arrived
at the ranch nine miles away early next morning none the worse off

a word about this wonderful she ass or Jinny as I called her. I rode
bareback and went everywhere. She was jet black with a white muzzle,
average size for a burro, but utterly different from any of that
breed. With a kick of her heels she would gallop off like a horse and
keep it up. When we were driving cattle she would nip at their heels
with her teeth like a shepherd dog. (Cattle kick high so there is
little danger, but horses and mules sometimes land on the dogs head.)</font></font></p>

some money carrying passengers. The old Jinny really raised me. She
had four colts which I sold when they were grown. Where she came from
I never knew, or where she eventually went. When I left the ranch for
good they said she wandered away. She was so gentle &ndash; never
bit, kicked or struck. If anyone stuck a sharp stick between her
shoulders or her withers, she would give a fine performance at

[and by now it&rsquo;s almost beginning to sound that working for the

buying a cow that was born in Scotland and a bull from an American
herd. We kept all of the stock horses and cattle up at the head of
Fall Creek in the summer, driving them up and camping at the spring
from which the creek started. The black Galloways, against a
background of aspen made a wonderful picture as they stood knee-deep
in the lush green grass. Fall Creek rises in a spring near the top of
a ridge separating it from Hermosa Creek run-off at an altitude of
more than 8,000 feet, runs east down a canyon and leaps 60 feet [the
&ldquo;falls&rdquo; in Waterfall Ranch] into the Animas Valley and
down through our ranch of 300 acres into a slough connected to the
Animas River. Formerly, its waters, swollen by melting snow or rain,
flowed into a shallow bed, but once, during a terrible flood, it cut
a channel ten feet deep and more than that in width down to the
slough. People came from miles around to see the waterfall.

<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">It is now the year
1892, Al has just graduated from high school at age 19 in Durango,
CO, and it is once again time to take stock of the world. <i>Gentleman
Jim</i> Corbett defeats the great John L. Sullivan for the
heavyweight boxing title. In Europe, engineer-scientist Rudolph
Diesel patents a compression-ignition internal combustion engine that
will henceforth bear his name. Tchaikovsky writes <i>The Nut</i><i>c</i><i>racker</i>
ballet, and Christmas Season TV in the USA will never get over it.
Poets Walt Whitman and Alfred Lord Tennyson will die. Marshall Tito
of Yugoslavia, and future Emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie, are
born. Grover Cleveland is elected president for the second time, and
Gladstone becomes Prime Minister of England. Peace generally reigns
throughout the world, and the so-called <i>Conservative Era</i>
(1877-1901) still flourishes in America. The prospects for an
emerging high school graduate look promising, but let&rsquo;s have Al
tell us all about it.</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Finishing
high school in 1892, the question of which college to attend came up.
Father was in favor of having me become a mining engineer so they
[Al&rsquo;s parents] went to Bolder, CO, to visit the State School of
Mines. Mother saw so many saloons there that they came back and sent
me to State University at Boulder. Placed in a small boarding house,
I entered the University as a freshman B.S. candidate. The University
was small at that time though now it is world famous. I managed to
get through the freshman year, but ahead was mathematics and more
mathematics which I hated. So, the following year I changed to the
medical curriculum. The professor of Greek remarked facetiously [we
sincerely hope] that I had quit studying and taken up medicine. How
little he knew! A doctor <i>never </i>quits studying. He must study
and take courses all of his life if he wants to remain competent and
competitive.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">To
digress for a moment, many times as a youth I would take a saddle
horse from the ranch, a roll of blankets, rifle or shotgun and some
food, and ride off into the mountains. Sometimes I&rsquo;d stay a
week, once camping under a large spruce tree with little ones around
its edge, near a smooth meadow with lush grass for the picketed
horse. Well, it rained for a week every day, but my bedding at the
trunk of the tree remained dry. Another time, up at the head of Fall
Creek, I rode on up the peak as far as the horse could go. Tying him
to an aspen, I climbed on up until I came out on a rocky top. It was
raining below me, but all around in every direction the sky was
clear. It had always seemed to me that the cloud tops should be
smooth, but they were billowing. The sun shone out over all, and
presently the rocks began to hum<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote29anc" href="#sdfootnote29sym"><sup>29</sup></a>,
and my rifle did so also, and I became afraid of it and leaned it
against a stone. The burst of light was appalling. It seemed to me
that the real presence of God was all about, and it strangely moved
me. When I returned to the ranch I told no one and am telling it now
for the first time. For years I wondered how such a God as appeared
to me could be boxed up on a church altar.</font></font></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">It would be a pity,
we think, and well nigh criminal if we failed to pause and digress
also at this point. Clearly Al has recounted what, to him &ndash; as
it would be to any of us, a truly profound experience, not unlike
those often encountered in the Bible, where thunder and lightening
are presented as signs of the divine presence and power. (See Ex
19:16; Sir 43:16; or Rev 4:5, 8:5, 11:19, and 16:18, to cite just a
few.) And knowing what we know of lightening today, it is probably
well that Al laid aside his gun. He may well have been on the verge
of a lightening strike such as today more likely would catch a
club-clutching golfer huddled under the single tree on the fairway
during a thunderstorm, and then this would have been a short story,
indeed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Of possibly even
more interest to us, however, are the questions that this startling
insert raises in our minds: why has the tale not been told before,
was not even Edna privy to it, and how did it come to be revealed at
this precise point in his narration, so seemingly completely out of
context? Recall that Al had been discoursing about switching from a
mining to a medical curriculum. Perhaps we might better consider it
as a switch from a career goal of dealing with the <i>m</i><i>aterial</i>
of the earth to the <i>people</i> of the earth, from a life of
indirect to direct service of humanity. We can only speculate, of
course, but this undercurrent of a possible basis for so substantial
a change in commitment to a life&rsquo;s endeavor seems worth
remarking. Certainly, the very fact of Al&rsquo;s confessed solitary
forays into the overwhelming awesomeness of the vast grandeur of the
untamed Rocky Mountain West marks him as a serious, reflective,
contemplative young man. Perhaps his lifelong dedication to the
well-being of his fellowman began that day high on the mountain!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Then too, there is
the central question raised by Al on the mountain that day. Who,
indeed, might not be dubious about an almighty God &ldquo;boxed up on
a church altar&rdquo; under the appearance of a wafer of bread? The
Bible tells us that even some of Christ&rsquo;s disciples found
Jesus&rsquo; announcement of the Eucharist &ldquo;a hard saying,&rdquo;
after which some of them &ldquo;no longer walked with him.&rdquo;
Scholars have long speculated that Satan was cast out of heaven and
&ldquo;all hell (literally) broke loose&rdquo; when Lucifer rejected
the notion that God would deign to become man in the person of the
helpless baby Jesus. As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, we then have
Christ telling humankind that God likewise deigned to assume the
appearance of bread and wine!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">There is, of course,
no difficulty with accepting that the Creator of the universe may
become anything He (or She?) chooses. The problem that strains our
comprehension &ndash; the test of faith &ndash; is: WHY? Why would an
Almighty God choose to become first man, and then bread? (Could man
unaided by revelation even conceive such exquisite testimony that
perfect love manifests itself in submission and service &ndash;
voluntary vulnerability?) Think of it, as Al obviously did: God
imprisoned in the host! Totally immobilized! Helpless! <i>WHY</i>?
Hey! We didn&rsquo;t bring it up. Al did. And, interestingly enough,
the Pope himself recently brought up an evident relationship between
being in the mountains and an impulse for profound contemplation.
Speaking to the members of the Italian Mountain-Climbing Club in May
1986 JPII<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote30anc" href="#sdfootnote30sym"><sup>30</sup></a>
remarked, &ldquo;In contact with the beauties of the mountains, in
the face of the spectacular grandeur of the peaks, the fields of snow
and the immense landscapes, man enters into himself and discovers
that the beauty of the universe shines not in the framework of the
exterior, but reaches into the interior heaven, that of the soul that
allows itself to be enlightened, and seeks to give meaning to life.&rdquo;
And it happened that in very fact Al was, in due course, sufficiently
enlightened through contemplation of his self-confided mystical
experience that he was brought to confess his own personal &ldquo;I
believe,&rdquo; about which more later. Now, we&rsquo;d best get back
to Al as he himself tells his story, picking up the thread as he
entered college in 1892.</p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">At
college I was much interested in chemistry, and spent all my spare
time in the laboratory. Once, given a piece of ore, my test showed
titanium, a rare metal. Showing it to the professor, his only remark
was, &ldquo;Well, go ahead and find out how much.&rdquo; This was too
strenuous, since freshman year only called for qualitative analysis,
not quantitative. Changing from Freshman B.S. to Freshman Medicine, I
met another medic Freshman, Walter Scott Chapman, and we have been
fast friends for 61 years. First-year medicine was also spent in
Boulder, and I occupied the same room at the little boarding house.
The period of 1893-94 was the time of many bank failures [the
&ldquo;business panic and depression of 1893<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote31anc" href="#sdfootnote31sym"><sup>31</sup></a>&rdquo;]
and father was caught in one but somehow managed to keep me in
school. The second and third years were conducted in Denver for
clinical purposes. I roomed and boarded with a friend of mother&rsquo;s
&ndash; a widow of a Methodist minister. During our last year
Chapman, a Gross Medic student, Roberts, and I had a room together
and took our meals at a restaurant. I recall one Greek cafe where one
could get a big stack of Sliced bread, a large bowl of oatmeal, and
one-half pint of milk for 15 cents.</font></font></p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Robert
was a pharmacist and coached me to take the state examination. So, I
passed, and became a registered pharmacist. [While on the subject of
pharmacists, it should be mentioned that Doc&rsquo;s sister Idonna
married a pharmacist, a Henry Wilson from Cortez, CO. When Henry
became an officer in the <i>Association of Colorado Phar</i><i>m</i><i>acists</i>,
he discovered that one of the very first names on their list of
registered pharmacists was Albert M. Wigglesworth. Henry&rsquo;s son
has followed in his father&rsquo;s footsteps and now is operating the
drug store in Cortez founded by his father. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
small, small world after all!&rdquo;]</font></font></p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">We
had many funny experiences when I was installed as head of the school
dispensary and Chapman assisted me. We noticed a pretty, shapely girl
who came to get a prescription filled and we flirted with her. We
were curious to know just what was her trouble. She was on the table
in the gynecological department as we came in. Boy, what a shock. She
had not one, but all three venereal diseases &ndash; gonorrhea,
syphilis, and chancroid. A year or two later I saw her in the county
hospital and she was a wreck. All her beauty was gone. She told me
her own mother had sold her to a diseased old man for property and
money.</font></font></p>

an assistant professor, Roberts, a friend of his, Chapman, and I were
having a glass of beer in a cafe. We had ordered the beer but had not
finished it at midnight when in walked three policemen. We rose to go
when one of the policemen said, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go anywhere
except with us.&rdquo; They hustled us into the police wagon (the
<i>Black </i><i>M</i><i>aria</i>) and put us &ndash; together with
the bartender &ndash; in jail. After perhaps a half-hour, we were
bailed out by the cafe&rsquo;s proprietor and Roberts and his friend
were subpoenaed to appear the next Monday in court. I was very much
afraid the event might reach the papers and father, but nothing came
of it. The women of Denver had put through a Sunday closing law, and
this had been a Saturday night. This was the only time I was in jail
as a prisoner.</font></font></p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Graduation
time came, and Chapman and I went up to Boulder to get our sheepskins
&ndash; Jun 1896. Roberts got his from Gross and went to Aguila, CO,
where he had a job waiting. I interned at County Hospital, Arapaho
County, and afterward, the Denver and City Hospital. Chapman got a
berth at St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital. I began by taking histories and
giving anesthetics. One month I relieved the hospital pharmacist for
which he paid me $35.00. This is all I ever received as a pharmacist.
As a reward for passing the hospital intern exam, father had me go to
the best tailor in Denver and bought me the latest suit in broadcloth
with tails. I wore it as a dress suit. When I went to be measured, my
clothes were so soaked with the vapor of ether that the tailor became
ill.</font></font></p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">All
of the interns were young, but I was the youngest. We had the right
to examine any patient, and once when we put a woman on the table she
said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want kids fooling around with me.&rdquo;
Another time I took the ambulance to the railroad station to meet a
patient. The patient, a lady, remarked, &ldquo;Why, they said they&lsquo;d
send a doctor for me.&rdquo;</font></font></p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">It
was during these days that we once tried to graft a section of the
peroneal nerve [that is, one near the fibula &ndash; the long, thin,
outer leg bone below the knee] from a dog&rsquo;s leg to supply-a
missing part in a man &ndash; result: failure. Had the section been
from a corpse, success might have crowned our efforts. In another
case, the oculist trephined a totally scarred cornea [that is, used a
small crown saw &ndash; a trephine &ndash; to remove a small circular
disk section] and replaced the tissue with that of a rabbit. Again:
failure. Today, the entire cornea is removed and a clear one from a
recently deceased human is sewed in. It was also at this time that,
having been raised as a Methodist and having read of dying persons
seeing deceased former relatives, angels, etc., I gave standing
orders to be called at every impending death. Everyone I witnessed
became unconscious before death, hence no visions. Later in my
practice I saw three deaths where the patients were conscious to the
end. Result: no visions.</font></font></p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Another
time, while still a hospital intern, I slipped up to a bed where a
two year old child was sleeping, and she never awakened until after
an operation for an imperferated anus was complete. When I rolled her
into the operating room, Dr. Parkhill addressed the roomful of
students, thus: &ldquo;This man has gone ahead with the anesthetic
without consulting me.&rdquo; Oh my, I thought, he&rsquo;s giving me
a lecture before the class, but then he continued, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
right &ndash; under six or over sixty, always give chloroform.&rdquo;
 Internship over, [and henceforth we shall refer to Al as <i>Doc</i>]
the question arose as to where to go. It was extremely hard to enter
the practice of medicine, as it was over crowded at the time. Doctors
stationed watchers around the parks and public places to call them in
case of any accident. One had to have gray hair and whiskers to
qualify. Today everyone wants the recent graduate with the latest
methods and many positions are open. (At the hospital, when answering
calls with the horse-drawn ambulance, the big Swede driver, noticing
my lameness, insisted on carrying patients in his arms to the vehicle
and did not use the stretcher. I was perfectly able to carry my end.)
Father was building railroads around Glenwood Springs, so I went
there finding my brother Will ready to go overland to Durango with a
pack mule and two horses father had bought for the ranch in the
Animas Valley. It seemed opportune to go along. We had a most
delightful trip, winding up the Crystal River, up canyons thousands
of feet deep, filled by snow slides, At one point the river bank was
washed away revealing a broad vein of onyx waiting to enrich some
miner. We should have filed a claim. Crossing over to Eagle River, we
camped at noon near the river. For miles down the valley the dead
standing grass covered the land. We had tramped down the years to
build a fire. Our meal finished, we suddenly saw a spark light the
grass. For a few minutes we fought the flames with our saddle
blankets until we put out the fire. Had it gotten away, it would have
swept the valley and set fire to the timber higher up. Right there I
learned something about camp fires that I never forgot. We arrived in
Gunnison, a small town, by night, even though mosquitoes nearly
devoured us riding by the river. They covered our horses and our
hands until they were red with blood. We made our way up to Grand
River and crossed over the Continental Divide to Pine River. At each
camp we caught all the mountain trout we could eat. Passing Lake City
one night we stopped at Camp Carson where father had a mining
interest. Carson was 14,000 feet elevation so, going up, the horses
had to stop for breath every few feet.</font></font></p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">We
stayed several days at the head of Pine River, fishing at a grand
pool that was as far as fish could go. We had venison that someone at
Carson had given us. We sun-dried and salted down some of the fish to
take to the ranch, now only two days ride away. We arrived at the
ranch and got a hearty welcome from mother and youngest brother,
Jack. Will had been working on the railroad at Glenwood Springs after
he wound up the cattle business there, so it was his cow ponies that
we&rsquo;d ridden on the trip. Father had bought the pack mule for
us.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">We
did not stay long at the ranch as Will heard of a proposed railroad
from Chihuahua to Durango, Mexico. Since he knew the promoter, he
felt sure of getting us both a job &ndash; himself as a transit man,
and myself as a doctor, since all works in Mexico required the
services of a medical man. We left the ranch taking a pack horse but
leaving the mule. Mother gave me a tall young mare, and we set out
for El Paso. It was now Oct, and the first night out our bedding was
covered with three inches of snow during the night. The wagon sheet
had protected us, and all that was needed was to sweep off the snow.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">We
rode out Canyon Largo and came down the Rio Grande (Rio Bravo, of
course, in Mexico) at Corrales. At our camps we had either rabbit or
quail to eat, as we carried a shotgun. Crossing the Rio Grande by
fording, we entered Albuquerque, then a small village of perhaps
5,000 [today &ndash; 1986 &ndash; it numbers more than 342,000]. The
depot then, as was customary, was a box car. From Albuquerque we
stayed on the east side of the river to Isleta, then forded west to
Socorro and on down to San Marchal. Fording again, we followed the
railroad out on to Jornada del Muerto. We obtained water at windmill
pumps used by the cattlemen. For fuel to cook with, we used dried
dung from the cattle. Rabbits and quail continued to be plentiful.
Swinging south, we finally came to El Paso. Will got a job with a
scraper, using some of our horses as a slip team. I worked as
assistant to the town&rsquo;s leading doctor, renting a room next to
his, and having a shingle made to show that I was a doctor. I also
got a small table and covered it with oil cloth. I did not succeed in
making any money. The town then had perhaps 5,000 people including
the Mexicans. Houses were going up all over the place. I saw the
possibilities, but had no money for real estate investment.</font></font></p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Two
incidents occurred in this period worthy of mention. One concerns my
first anesthetic for my surgeon. Wishing to make a good impression, I
started the anesthetic using chloroform by the open drop method. The
patient was on a sofa with no nurse present. After a few drops the
woman kicked me half-way across the room. Bottle and mask flew out of
my hands and made a clatter. The surgeon came rushing in, took in the
situation, and calmed the lady down. She said, &ldquo;Doctor, this
man is absurd.&rdquo; Continuing on, the operation was successful (a
curettage &ndash; scraping away tissue with a spoon-shaped
instrument) and the anesthetic was perfect. What went on in that
lady&rsquo;s head I&rsquo;ll never know. Anyway, anesthetics should
never be given unless a nurse is present.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">The
other incident was a consultation over the case of a railway
messenger clerk. This man was shot by a holdup man using a Winchester
rifle aimed upward from the ground while the clerk was standing at an
open car door. Twenty-five years later the x-ray showed the bullet
was beneath the right scapula [shoulder blade]. <i>After</i> seeing
the x-ray, he began to have pain and insisted upon removal of the
bullet. The bullet was just beneath the spine of the scapula and Dr.
Turner, the surgeon, wanted to cut the shoulder muscle free from the
spinal column and turn the scapula outward. I pointed out to him that
that would ruin his shoulder and I thought, after studying the x-ray
plate for days, that it was best to torphine [tunnel] through the
scapula below the spine. This he did, and after a little search with
forceps came out with the ball entirely encapsulated having caused no
symptoms.</font></font></p>

I write this in Washington DC on 20 Jan 1954, it is snowing and has
been raining or snowing for several days, the snow only staying on
the lawn or cars. Had it all been snow, it would have been quite
deep, which reminds me of the winter of 1887-88 in Colorado at the
ranch [when Doc would have been 15]. In Feb the snow was four feet on
the level. A person stepping into it would not go to the bottom, but
cattle and horses were soon on their bellies and helpless. Most of
the cattle stayed near the hay shed, but a few had to be fed where
they stood. We ran out of sugar and coffee, so Charlie, my oldest
brother, took a saddle horse and a pack horse and started for
Durango, six miles away. He only got a quarter of a mile and returned
with exhausted horses. Later in the day, the Ambold brothers, who
lived a few miles further up the valley, came by with a herd of about
25 head of steers for market. By each steer taking turns in the lead,
a path was broken so that we got our supplies. The little narrow
gauge railroad was completely blockaded. Later on the coffee gave out
in Durango to the great distress of the womenfolk.</font></font></p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Getting
back to El Paso, I&rsquo;ve already mentioned how Will was driving
some of our horses as a slip team on a scraper, moving earth on some
city project, until we heard that his contractor friend Bradbury was
working a railroad construction from Durango, Mexico. So, we sold
everything except our blankets, and took a train for Chihuahua. I
found I could register to practice by getting a letter from state
senator Casimero Harela in Colorado. Also, I was offered a job at the
principal drug store on the basis of my Colorado pharmacy license.
But fate stepped in and the RR project fell through. Will was going
back to Colorado. He had worked a few days as commissary clerk, so we
both had some money in addition to that from the sale of our horses,
etc. I did not like the idea of staying on. Maybe my fortune would
have been made. &ldquo;Quien sabe.&rdquo;</font></font></p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Arriving
in El Paso once again, we got tickets for Albuquerque, NM. Father had
given me a beautiful Howard watch with a gold case. I traded the case
for an open face gold-filled watch and $30. We arrived in
Albuquerque, stayed a few days, then bought a small pack saddle which
I carried while Will carried some food and blankets as we struck out
for Durango overland. A couple of miles out we saw a couple of burros
and a man nearby. He said the donkeys belonged to him, so we gave him
$5 for the two. The way he took off after we paid him made us doubt
if he were the rightful owner. We headed into the Jemez Mountains and
slept under the stars at night, coming down at Monero on the Rio
Grande Railway, and in a few days we were at the ranch. Shortly
thereafter, I was offered a contract as a physician in the Indian
Service at Navajo Springs, CO. My contract called for one visit a
week to the Agency or on special call &ndash; $500 a year. I lived in
Cortez [1986 pop.: 7,100], 10 or 12 miles away, where I started in
practice in the Spring of 1898. My brother Jack let me have his
single footing mare, Christy, and by using the saddle bags furnished
by the U.S, I was able to make calls out of town.</font></font></p>

I was able to get a cart and another mare from the ranch, and later a
double harness and an open buggy so that I could drive both mares.
The &ldquo;farmers among my clientele were poor, so many fees were
paid in oats and hay. My team was so well fed that when I turned them
loose they stayed around and would come running up whenever I called.</font></font></p>

was a Dr. Sperry also practicing in Cortez, but he had a reputation
for drinking, so he lost out and moved away. Once the missionary at
Aneth on the San Juan River [across the state line in Utah] sent for
Sperry, and as it was late in the evening when the call came, he
refused to go. A workman at the mission had broken his leg, so I told
Sperry that if he would not go, I would. We drove all night in the
messenger&rsquo;s spring wagon, making the 60 mile trip by early
morning. The workman had slipped on a wet adobe and fallen 20 feet,
breaking his left femur in the middle, the bone ends sticking through
the flesh. (The nearest hospital was 120 miles away by wagon over
rough roads.) So, I gave the patient chloroform, put on a plaster
cast from the stuff I&rsquo;d taken along, cut a window over the
wound, put on dressings and left more dressings there. I told the man
to lie still, took a check for $60 from the missionary, and left. The
very next day, the workman sat up, causing the broken ends to
overlap. He made a good recovery anyhow and was pleased even though
he had a limp. I couldn&rsquo;t help but think how much better
hospital care would have been.</font></font></p>

and I clashed on two other cases where my diagnoses proved to be
correct. Well, as I stated earlier, Sperry moved away leaving the
field clear for me. About this time my saddle mare developed a ring
bone and was a little lame thereafter. I had an experienced horseman
treat her.</font></font></p>

I first appeared at the Navajo Springs Agency, old Chief Ignacio of
the [southern] Ute Indians [Ouray being the contemporary chief of the
northern Ute] looked me over and said he didn&rsquo;t think I was
much of a doctor as I would have fixed myself up. As mentioned
earlier, I was lame from an untreated fracture which happened when I
was two years old. This same old chief was asked by a minister if
he&rsquo;d ever thought of the hereafter and where he would go. &ldquo;I
know what will happen to me after I die,&rdquo; said  Ignacio.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; replied the minister, &ldquo;and
just what do you think that will be?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
the chief, &ldquo;the Utes take my body to Mesa Verde and after a few
years the white people will dig up my bones and take them to
Washington.&rdquo;  You may wonder how it was that I took so long to
get settled in practice, wandering down to Mexico and back. There
were just no positions available. Today a young graduate has many
openings. In those days people looked askance at a young doctor and
only wanted one with a flowing white beard. The profession was also
overcrowded. Since I was lame, I was not eligible for the Army, Navy
or Public Health as they required physical fitness. Only the Indian
Service was open to me. </font></font>

my second year at Cortez, the Superintendent, Louis Knachsted, who
was stationed at Ignacio, CO, and who was in charge of all the
southern cities, told me that if I would take the Civil Service exam
he could pay me $1,000.00 and I could stay in Cortez and practice as
usual. So, I went up to Pueblo, CO, at the appointed place. There I
met an old roommate who practiced in Aquila, CO. We sure did the
town. So much so, that I only made 80% on the exam.</font></font></p>

at Cortez, I forgot all about the exam until much later when a
telegram from the Indian Office arrived asking why I did not accept
Ft. Lapwai. I wired back that the only reason was that I&rsquo;d
never received any such offer. Next came a wire offering me Ft. Lewis
Indian School near Durango, CO. I had met the superintendent, Dr.
Breen, in Durango (in some saloon, I guess). Anyway, when he was in
Washington on business, he was handed the customary three highest

physician for his school, so he chose me.</font></font></p>

interesting to note that Doc&rsquo;s 12 Nov 1900 appointment
specified: <i>You will be obliged ta pay traveling expenses to the
school, and your board while there</i>. It further advised: <i>The
work will be difficult and confining, with little opportunity for
recreation or social pleasure; long hours of service are required,
and every empl</i><i>o</i><i>yee must be willing to work night or day
If special emergencies arise; and duties of an employee do not end at
a given hour, but may continue Indefinitely</i>. Now, you may think,
&ldquo;And poor Doc thought he was missing out on the Army!&rdquo;
But the facts are, to Doc&rsquo;s accustomed way of living this
sounded like La Dolce Vita, AND &ndash; he would be meeting his
wife-to-be at Fort Lewis. &ldquo;Little opportunity for recreation or
social pleasure,&rdquo; indeed. They didn&rsquo;t know Dr. Albert M.
Wigglesworth! So saying, let&rsquo;s let Doc continue his own story.</p>

was quite discouraged at Cortez at the time of my appointment to Ft.
Lewis, having had a lot of deaths from diphtheria (this being before
antitoxin was in use), and so I was delighted to change. Before
moving on, however, I&rsquo;d like to recall a few other incidents of
that period. There was one case that tested my ingenuity. I was
called about 9 pm to see a woman in labor who lived about five miles
away. I hitched my bay mare, one that I had borrowed from father&rsquo;s
ranch, to a cart, drove out to the patient and tied the team to a
post. It was snowing, so I put a lap robe over the mare and went
inside where I found a girl, 18 or 20 years old, in labor and quite
exhausted. I scrubbed up my hands with soap and water, examined the
patient, and found no other reason for a difficult delivery other
than exhaustion. Now, the nearest hospital was 100 miles away at
Durango. Getting her there was out of the question, so I proceeded
with the delivery using what material I had with me.</font></font></p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">I
had forceps, a mask and chloroform, so I boiled the forceps and a
cloth to put them on. Using two chairs, which I placed by the
bedside, I arranged the girls legs, one over each chair. I needed
help, so I asked the girl&rsquo;s mother if there was anyone beside
herself in the house. She said there were two teenage girls upstairs,
so I told her to get then down quickly. I turned a leg over to each
girl exposing the field of operation, then gave the chloroform bottle
to the mother, instructing her to put one drop at a time on the mask
on the patient, after I had her under the anesthetic. I placed
forceps on the infant&rsquo;s head, looked up and saw the mother
staring at me and pouring the chloroform in a stream. In one stroke I
knocked the bottle and mask away and pulling with a side-to-side
stroke delivered a fine big yelling boy. The child was illegitimate,
and I suspect rape was involved because the girl shouted the father&rsquo;s
name during delivery. Well, I tied the cord with string that had been
boiled, and the final result was an uneventful delivery. Meanwhile,
the wind had blown the lap robe off the mare and she was shivering.
We drove home &ndash; no payment, but much satisfaction in having
done a commendable job.</font></font></p>

case at Cortez stands out in my memory: a pregnant multipara [a woman
who has borne more than one child] with abdomen so distended that she
became helpless. I called the doctor at Dolores, CO, in consultation.
Taking a long needle and syringe, I plunged the needle into the
abdomen below the umbilicus, squirting some of the withdrawn fluid
into my hand. Smelling it revealed the unmistakable odor of liquor
amnii (the fluid in which the fetus floats in the membrane inside the
womb, the fluid of the so-called &ldquo;water break&rdquo;], This
ruled out urine or ascites [free fluid in the abdominal cavity due to
disease]. Being a multipara, I had no trouble in introducing a finger
and rupturing the membrane. Fluid gushed forth, poured off the bed
onto the floor and escaped down a crack. When it finally subsided a
dead five months old fetus was delivered. I was not satisfied that
everything was OK, although the patient was now comfortable, so I
packed the vagina with gauze after removing a small placenta. Next
morning I removed the packing and another dead fetus about three
months with a tiny placenta. Recovery was uneventful.</font></font></p>

made many trips far out on the Reservation of the Southern Utes and
found my eyesight better than theirs. An amusing incident occurred at
the Agency. A group of teachers arrived to see the Indians. A squaw
was there with her papoose wrapped with buckskin and carried on her
back on a board. One of the gushing teachers ran up to the baby,
chucked it under the chin, and seeing a little black object down on
the front said, &ldquo;And what is this?&rdquo;, and picked it up.
From the deep blush that suffused her face it was evident that she
found out. She beat a hasty retreat with a knowledge that sometimes
such objects are left outside for sewerage purposes. As for the Ute
women, some of them were quite attractive, and occasionally some old
Buck would say to me, &ldquo;Maybe so you love &lsquo;em? Heap like
up white man&rsquo;s talk.&rdquo; But, no dice for me, as there were
too many white ones in Cortez more to my taste.</font></font></p>

there were no doctors for miles around and no one at Hesperus, a coal
town four miles north. I kept my brother Jack&rsquo;s saddle mare, as
he was married and working in a mining town. Later I bought an
ex-cavalry horse for my use. My, what a change, although my salary
was only $1000 a year. I now had a well equipped pharmacy, a hospital
and a nurse. The nurse was not a graduate, but that did not matter.
At Navajo Springs the one room drug room had a counter and shelves
full of crude drugs, including several quarts of sulfuric acid. I was
ordered to vaccinate all of the unvaccinated Utes on this end of the
Reservation, and did so to the number of 500, The young daughter of
the war chief ran a tepee pole into her arm at the vaccination site
and the Indian trader said this same chief was going to kill me as
the girl died of septicemia [blood-poisoning] and I was not called. I
said if he came into my drug room looking for trouble I would
dehydrate him with a bottle of sulfuric acid. Later the war chief
came in smiling and shook hands. Maybe the trader was just kidding.</font></font></p>

Lewis, once an Army Fort and then an Indian boarding school, was
taken over by the state to be a training school for teachers. It was
built in the customary Army hollow square at an altitude of 7500
feet, with a beautiful view of the nearby La Plata Mountains. It
seemed like heaven. The clerk at Navajo Springs used to treat Indians
his way, and it&rsquo;s a wonder that he didn&rsquo;t kill them. He
frequently gave them four C.C. pills and two ounces of nitre at a
dose. Also, he used the rib shear from the major operating set (all
the instruments the U.S. provided) to cut off the frozen toes of his
pet rooster. Before going to Cortez I had borrowed $300.00 from
mother and soon paid her back. I was County Doctor and Medical

always too cool to lie on the couch. As mentioned earlier, Ft. Lewis
is 7500 feet in altitude, but a few miles to the north the La Plata
Mountains rise to 14,000 feet. Once a lot of employees of the Fort
drove out into the mountains and spread a picnic dinner. Before we
could sit down to enjoy it, a snow storm deposited two inches of snow
on us as we huddled under lap robes, Very quickly thereafter, the sun
came out and the snow vanished. It was the Fourth of July.</font></font></p>

time all of us drove over to Mancos, CO, hired a guide, and pack and
saddle horses to visit the [mis-named] Aztec ruins at Mesa Verde. The
only way up there was by a steep winding trail. I had taken Jack&rsquo;s
mare, Christy, and I put Miss Wright on her and told her to let the
mare have her head and sit straight up and hold on to the saddle
horn. It was a sight to behold: this tiny woman sitting on that 1000
pound mare, slipping and sliding down the trail on our return. Edna
had never been on a horse before. How the other ladies made it on
their ponies, I don&rsquo;t know. I only had eyes for one. We stayed
all night after exploring the ruins, sleeping on the ground on
bedding furnished by the guides &ndash; the men in one place, the
women in another. Food and bedding were included in the contract.
Today buses go to Mesa Verde over paved roads from Cortez to a hotel
at the ruins. The north end of Mesa Verde rises up between Cortez and
Mancos. How high is the mesa? I don&rsquo;t know, but would guess
about 800 or 1000 feet. [The current aviation sectional chart for the

immediately surrounding area which averages about 7500 feat above sea

Rio Grande than to find Indians on the Reservations or pueblos. As a
result, the school contained mostly Mexicans and Navajos. The
Mexicans could be reached by railroad, whereas it was a long drive
overland to the Navajo. We only had one Ute, a girl. All single
employees boarded at the mess and took turns managing it. Our board
was usually $8.00 a month. Miss Wright was kindergarten teacher and
had come out with her aunt [Kate Watson], who was the head teacher,

first mention of Edna entering his life &ndash; on a guided tour to
Mesa Verde he would have us believe. He surely had her under
surveillance for some time before seating her astride (as the only
extant picture indicates she rode) his mare. In any event, the
courtship for certain extended only a year by Doc&rsquo;s own
testimony. Clearly, he knew just what he&rsquo;d been waiting for,
and at age 29 he&rsquo;d found <i>M</i><i>iss Wright</i>. Henceforth,

four mules, to pick up the ladies as we all went up White River to
fish and picnic. The Major, his Lieutenants and I rode horseback, of
course. Fish, deer, and turkeys were all plentiful.</font></font></p>

of my jobs was going out to camps (these were just wickiups &ndash; a

covered &ldquo;hogans&rdquo; unique to the Navajo, and which
unwittingly will perhaps someday serve as the prototype homes of any
post-atomic-blast suburb] to examine the pupil prospects for the
school. I remember turning up the coarse muslin jacket of 12 year old
girl to use the stethoscope and the body lice that covered her body
scampered for cover. Speaking of insects, there were many kinds and
many of them. I woke up one morning and on the bare floor was a six
inch centipede. He disappeared down a crack before my wife saw him.
Once I turned over a chip near the stream and there was a scorpion. I
had a row of tarantulas mounted down the side of the window in my
office which I had killed with chloroform. I treated one Indian for
multiple punctures on a leg caused by sharp feet of a centipede.
There was no poison, just dirty feet. I treated another Indian who
had put his hand down on a tarantula and was bitten. The hand was
swollen, but soon healed. There was no sign of systemic poisoning.</font></font></p>

fly chrysomia [gold-bodied], the larva of which is a maggot that
infects any wound or sore was very common. It appeared in livestock

even invaded the nostrils of persons who were drunk or slept soundly.
My first contact with this pest was in sores on the back of a horse

The cure is to pour on chloroform and cover the site with wet gauze

method of conducting childbirth was to have the woman pull on a rope

arms around the abdomen and another pushed from front to back with
her hands. By such violence something had to give. I was called in
alarm to attend a woman on whom this method had been used. They said
something had appeared following the placenta. Scrubbing up as best I
could, having no rubber gloves, I found the uterus turned inside-out
into the vagina. The camp was on a hill just above the Fort, so I
went down and asked their doctor to help me anesthetize the patient.
We brought up ether and more antiseptics. He was very nice about it
all, and while I gave the ether he examined her. I said that while he
was there he might as well go ahead and reduce the deformity. He
tried, but failed. Flies were swarming about, and the hot sun beat
through the thin tin roof, and I was desperate at the thought of a
hysterectomy even if they would admit her to the Army hospital where
there were all male nurses. Could I do it in the camp? I pushed the
ether aside and told him to let me try. Placing two fingers at the
ring formed by the cervix, the inside slipped back suddenly, possibly
due to no skill of mine but more from relaxation by ether. Was I
relieved! An inverted uterus is extremely rare. The patient made a
quick recovery.</font></font></p>

must have been a vent above, for the air was not close. No doubt it
had been an Apache hideout. I picked up a piece of a sandal foot made

claustrophobia, let me digress to explain. Once, when I was about 11
years old, we lived in a company house in Durango below the railroad
track. We had moved there from over the drug store. Our rooms were in
one part of the building, the rest occupied by the railroad offices.
A high board fence enclosed the back of the house, and further back
was a stable and a granary or feed room. In this feed room, besides
hay, was a wood box about five feet long by three feet high and two
feet wide, with about four inches of oats in the bottom. The box had
rope handles made by boring holes in the ends, passing a rope
through, and tying a knot, passing the other end through another
hole, tying another knot and the intervening loop serving as a
handle. I&rsquo;m guessing at all the measurements. It may have been
4x4x4. The box was fitted with a hasp and stipple so it could be
locked.</font></font></p>

the grain box and fastened the lid. We laughed and giggled. The top
fitted rather close, and suddenly I noticed that it seemed difficult
to breathe. Fortunately, I had my sharp pocket knife, so I cut off a
rope knot and had Jack put his mouth to the hole while I did the same
at the other end. Meanwhile, Will had gone into the house and sat
down to read. Suddenly, mother exclaimed, &ldquo;Where are the
children?&rdquo; Will dashed out and released us. We were drenched
with sweat (it was July) and rather unsteady. Mother was stirred out
of her usual complacency and felt like thrashing Will.</font></font></p>

interested in medicine or Indians, only artifacts, old blankets and
old jewelry. I took him over to the Fort and introduced him to the
Army surgeons. As Ft. Defiance [1986 pop.: 3,400] was at least 300

so it was arranged in Washington. I left with an Agency team of mares

was to follow by ambulance, if possible, or by buckboard and train,

obtained funds to build a 60 bed frame hospital. Prior to this,
tonsillectomies, amputations and cataract and trachoma operations
were done at the Episcopal Hospital. Things were beginning to improve
and my practice grew. I was allowed an assistant and two trained
nurses. A physician was stationed at the San Juan Agency &ndash; 100
miles away, one at Tohatchi &ndash; 50 miles away, and one at Chinle
&ndash; 45 miles distant.</font></font></p>

16 Jan 1907 another child was born to us, a baby girl, and such to
our sorrow she died 11 months later on 31 Dec 1907. She died of
peritonitis caused by multiple perforation from a foreign body, a
sliver from a piece of glass or a razor blade. I delivered her and
performed the post mortem autopsy as the Superintendent, a physician,
declined to do it. My first and greatest sorrow was brought on by her
death, and I can still hear her pitiful little moan. The agony of a
decision to operate or not! Perhaps it is just as well that I did
not, for I&rsquo;m sure it would have been hopeless under the
circumstances. We got a small white coffin from Gallup and I drove
Suzanne Marie&rsquo;s body down to St. Michael&rsquo;s, and the
Sisters there dressed her in clothes. She locked like an angel, all
in white, and we buried her in the graveyard on the mesa overlooking
the school, &ldquo;where the coyotes howl and the wind blows free.&rdquo;</font></font></p>

poignant letters of this period that warrant incorporation at this
point; first, because they flesh out the heart-rending dimensions of
this tragedy, and second, because they comprise just about the only
letters that Edna ever saved &ndash; thereby testifying to the depths
of her grief. These letters, though, are also notable in their own
right, notable because of the singular unity that marks the variety
of ways in which God-loving people evidence their simple but great
faith. One wonders what supplies and supports the fortitude required
of folks confronting great personal tragedy in our own seemingly
godless days. Perhaps herein lies the basis for the current twin
epidemics of suicide and drug abuse. It may be well to resurrect the
alternative posed by these letters, thus:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%"><u>31 Dec 1908</u>
(from a Ft. Defiance neighbor to the Wright family in Washington DC):
It may comfort you in your grief for poor dear little Suzanne, who
has gone from us, to know how brave Dr. and Mrs. Wigglesworth are in
their great sorrow. <i>Each of them is thinking of the other</i>, he
in the loving care and thought that he always has for her, and she
realizes that his 120 Indian patients plus dear Suzanne&rsquo;s
illness are more than one man can bear of life&rsquo;s burden.
Suzanne looks so beautiful in her little white dress, a calm peaceful
look on her dear sweet face. She struggled so hard for her life that
we did not think she could be taken from us. But, the angels loved
her best, and if you could only see her, you would exclaim, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
will be done!&rdquo; It is sad for them to be so far away from you
all at this time, but their friends here will do what they can to
comfort them. Believing that God will help you all to bear this
sorrow, I am Sincerely&hellip;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%"><u>5 J</u><u>an 1908</u>
(from Chinle, AZ, to the Wigglesworths): Have just received the sad
news of the death of your darling baby. She was so dear, so precious
to Jesus that He could spare her to you but for one short happy year,
then take her to His loving arms. How well I recall her sweet little
face the last evening I saw her. May God comfort you both as He alone
can in this dark hour. With a heart full of sympathy, I am&hellip; 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%"><u>5</u><u> </u><u>J</u><u>an
1908</u> (from Big Pine, CO, to Edna): Your postcard of the 1st
conveying the sad news of Suzanne&rsquo;s death came this morning.
Poor little innocent child! How she must have suffered during those
five weeks. The New Year brought deep sorrow to her father and you,
but the beginning of a new and glorious life for the tenderly nursed
little flower whose earthly sweetness faded ere it had scarcely
begun. It seems strange to us &ndash; we do not understand that a
sinless being should have to suffer so much. Perhaps the All-wise
Creator let her suffer during those many days all the misery and pain
that would have been her allotment had she lived for many years. I&rsquo;m
sure that no mortal ever enters this world, if life is theirs for
even a few hours, without having some pain or sorrow. My Sincere
sympathy for yourself and husband and the little brother whose
playmate he will so often miss. Trusting that a merciful God and time
will bring comfort, I am&hellip;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%"><u>6</u><u> Jan 1908</u>
(from Cincinnati, OH, to Edna): I received your postcard this morning

sympathy for you and the Dr., and also little Eliot. He will miss
her, too. Yours with love and sympathy&hellip;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%"><u>7 Jan 1908</u>
(from Valley Center, CO, to the Wigglesworths): I wish I could tell
you how inexpressibly sorry we are for you in your bereavement. I can
only pray that He who bears our sorrows may help you bear yours. Even
as the sword pierced the very soul of the Blessed Virgin, even so
must it pierce that of the children of men to the end of time. And
blessed are we, too, when we can truly say, &ldquo;Thy will be done.
The Lord giveth and the lord taketh away, blessed be the name of the
Lord.&rdquo; The Lord be with you. The Lord make His face shine upon
you, and give you peace. Most sincerely&hellip;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%"><u>12 Jan 1908</u>
(from Santa Fe, NM, to the Wigglesworths): Accept my sincere sympathy
in this your hour of sorrow. A letter from our Sisters at St.
Michael&rsquo;s informed me of the death of your little darling. I
could not keep the tears back when I thought of the dear little one
as I last saw her. She was so cute. Words seem so cold and empty at a
time like this, but may He who drank the bitter chalice to the dregs
be your support and comfort. It is hard at times to say, &ldquo;Thy
will be done,&rdquo; when the poor human heart is crushed and
bleeding, but the thought of His bitter agony in the garden will give
us strength and submission. Our own dear Mother Mary, also, made a
great sacrifice at the foot of the cross of her Son. How sweet it is
to feel that she can sympathize with us in such bitter trials. Let us
then be generous and say, &ldquo;Fiat.&rdquo; Placing all in the
Sacred Heart of Jesus, I remain yours in our Lord&hellip;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">But, as is virtually
always the case, just about he time we are almost overwhelmed by the
mystery of death, the miracle of new life confronts us Once again. So
it is that just about this time Edna received a post card from
Gallup. It is not clear whether it is from Doc or possibly a Dr.
Brown, Since the salutation greets &ldquo;Dear Friends,&rdquo; and
the card closes with a cryptic aside to the effect that it has been a
year since a Mrs Brown was confined &ldquo;over there,&rdquo; and
concludes finally with a &ldquo;Kiss the babies for me,&rdquo;
followed by a cramped &ldquo;V.B.&rdquo;, which might signify either
wishes for the &ldquo;very best&rdquo; or rather be the originator&rsquo;s
initials, but the basic message was otherwise typical of Doc&rsquo;s
experience. It read: <i>I</i><i> assisted at the birth of a 12 p</i><i>o</i><i>und

and stored in sawdust from the mill. An old cabin was used for this.
A team, Studebaker buggy and saddle horses were always available.
Besides the assistant doctors I&rsquo;ve already mentioned, there was
a Mission M. D. at Hubbell&rsquo;s [the oldest continuously operating
trading post on the Navajo Indian Reservation &ndash; from 1878 &ndash;
and just a yell southwest of Ganado &ndash; which is Spanish for

60 bed frame hospital, a 25 bed TB sanatorium, and Miss Thackera&rsquo;s

trachoma which was prevalent on the Reservation. In some areas 50% of

after his uncle, Herbert Francis Wright, Edna&rsquo;s oldest

and me. I left them in Washington DC with Edna&rsquo;s parents and
entered the New York Medical School and Hospital where I took classes
in Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat. I was given a diploma in six weeks. I
attended a city hospital for trachoma among the gamin [homeless
street urchins &ndash; Doc&rsquo;s vocabulary would vie with William
F. Buckley&rsquo;s], and went to Ellis Island to witness the trachoma
exams of immigrants, and probably knew more about the effects and
treatment of trachoma than the New York doctors.</font></font></p>

employees. My son John was born 5 Apr 1913, so now we had three fine
boys. School facilities at the Fort were bad, but the older boys, and
eventually John, did attend the kindergarten for the Navajos. A white
teacher was obtained for the white children, finally, but since my
wife had been a teacher she taught them much. [This &ldquo;white
teacher&rdquo; school was operated by a Mrs. Renfrew in her dining
room. Nine or ten children sat around a table, with Eliot as the
oldest, Jack the youngest, and Frank somewhere in between. The grades
ran from kindergarten to the eighth. Later in the year a more or less
formal school was opened under AZ laws which required a student body
of 13 to qualify. Jack, although only five, was drafted to fill out
the complement.]</font></font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">This seems the
proper point to inject a little elaboration about Fort Defiance,
since it was the site of Doc&rsquo;s longest tour (Dec 1904 &ndash;
Apr 1918), and the locale in which all four of his children were born
(between 1905-1913), and where his only daughter died in infancy. It
was established in 1851 at an elevation of 6862 feet at the mouth of
the Canyon Bonito (<i>Pretty Little Canyon</i>), on the southern
slope of Mount Chuska, and thus falls within the Navajo Reservation.
It lies about a mile west of the AZ-NM border, some 80 miles south of
Four Corners. It is one of 12 so-called Ft. Defiances in the United
States, and was the locale of the losing 1860 Navajo uprising against
the <i>Belagaana</i> &ndash; that being the Navajo designation of
&ldquo;whites&rdquo; after the sound of the Spanish <i>American</i><i>o</i>.
Just over the NW hill lies the Canyon de Chelly [&ldquo;de Shay&rdquo;,
after the Spanish corruption of the Navajo <i>Tsegi </i>for &ldquo;Rock
Canyon&rdquo;] In 1853 a nameless Army engineer labeled it the &ldquo;most
beautiful and interesting post as a whole in New Mexico.&rdquo; [The
Fort was originally in that part of the New Mexico Territory which
subsequently became the state of Arizona.] The first school on the
entire Navajo Reservation was established there in 1869, and the
first boarding school (which remained in operation through 1959) in
1882. This was the setting in which Edna plied her teaching skills,
Doc practiced his medical magic, and the three Wigglesworth boys grew
up. Today the Fort is the site of a General Dynamics missile parts
plant, and Fairchild semi-conductor installation which builds
transistors and integrated circuits. So much for the <i>O</i><i>ld
Frontier</i>, long since engaged in fashioning the <i>New Frontier</i>.
Now, let&rsquo;s get back to Doc.</p>

offer was made to me in the Spring of 1918 to take the job as Head of
the Health Section in the Indian Office in Washington DC. We stored
our belongings at St. Michael&rsquo;s Mission and went East during
war time. We arrived on 11 Apr 1918 and that night two inches of snow
fell. Housing was very difficult to find, so we stayed with Edna&rsquo;s
parents for a while. We were finally able to rent a house by buying
the furniture, and put the children in school. After six months the
owner sold the house, and as I hated my job, we headed back to Ft.
Defiance, having heard from the Superintendent that there was now a
school for the children of white employees.</font></font></p>

thinking back over the many lost lives resulting from sending the
Navajo children to schools off the Reservation where they contracted
TB then came home to die. I was always an advocate of Reservation
schools. Once I had to act as an interpreter between a daughter who
had returned from a non-Reservation school and her mother. A headman,
Peshlakai, said, &ldquo;You take away our children and return them a
bag of bones.&rdquo; The majority of pupils, even if not sick, had to
return, as the whites would have none of them, no matter how well
educated or skillful. The whites would say in derision, &ldquo;Back
to the blanket!&rdquo; Speaking of acting as interpreter, my ability
to speak Navajo was helped by the two years among the Chiricahua
Apaches, as they are both Athapascan.</font></font></p>

year after we returned from the East, the school for the white

transferred to the Albuquerque Indian School, I also had medical
jurisdiction over the Southern Pueblos, Picuris [a smallish tribe in
north central NM], San Juan, San Felipe and Isleta. With permission
from Superintendent Perry, previously known at Ft. Defiance, I also
had a considerable private Mexican practice [for which, Doc neglects

back to Ft. Defiance for a moment, I recall when Edna&rsquo;s sister
Alma visited us there. During that time I had a call to Chinle. The
sister of the interpreter was ill, so the Field Matron placed the
call. I took a spring wagon, team, and blankets, together with Alma,
baby Eliot and baby Suzanne, and headed for the mountain top
overlooking Chinle through the rain. We camped in a partly finished
building which was to become the farmer&rsquo;s quarters when one
would be appointed. I took the Matron&rsquo;s pony and rode down to
the camp. We crossed the Nazlini, and though it was OK going down, it
was swollen by the rain on our return. Incidentally, the patient was
dying of TB, so I let her eat the little green watermelons her
brother brought. Well, we followed up the Nazlini until almost across
from our camp where we met three Navajo on horseback. We were afraid
to cross as the stream was so muddy and filled with floating logs and
brush. But one of the Indians stripped down and walked across, so we
followed. I thought of my wife, my sister-in-law and my babies. What
would they do if I were drowned? Also, I had no insurance then.</font></font></p>

we had many narrow escapes and many sorrows. I had to drive into
Gallup on business, so Edna thought Eliot should go with me and visit
a boy friend. I took him with me and left him with his friend. To my
surprise, as I was leaving, he came to the buggy and said, &ldquo;I
want to go with you.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think
your mother would approve of that.&rdquo; So, instead of bursting
into tears, the brave little fellow straightened his shoulders and
went back. How often I wish I&rsquo;d listened to his plea. The next
day I went to Tohatchi on a call and on my return found the
superintendent and Edna waiting to take us to Gallup as they had been
notified that Eliot had been shot and to come at once. We left the

youths about 15 or 16 had been out rabbit hunting with 22 caliber
rifles. They lived next door to the boy Eliot was visiting. He and a
six year old boy were playing with some pigeons. The older boys
placed their guns against the house and the six year old got up and
took one of the guns. Just then one of the older boys came out, took
the gun away, and told the child to leave the gun alone. Foolishly,
he did not unload it. He had no sooner gone in the house when the
little boy got the gun, pulled the hammer back and fired. Eliot was
shot through the lower part of his left lung, and the bullet came out
on the opposite side of the spine. He had been put to bed, and the
local doctor had taken the bullet out from just under the skin. The
obturator nerve [which serves two muscles in the rump region] was
damaged, and he walked thereafter with a slight hitch due to a little
shortening of the leg. There were no other complications.</font></font></p>

random thoughts: We had many parties and picnics to break the grind
at Ft. Apache and Ft Defiance. I delivered all four of my children,
and Edna breast fed them. Two other things come to mind. One was the
removal of a tumor about the size of a chestnut from the right breast
of the trader from Chinle. The pathologist in San Francisco (where I
sent the tumor) said that I got it just in time, that it was about
ready to burst the capsule. The other was the birth by a Navajo woman
of a harlequin fetus &ndash; extremely rare. It resembled a large
scorpion with claws and joints. It lived only a short time. I wish I
could have preserved it, but had no means, even though it was a
hospital case. The brief time it was alive it did not cry like a baby
but whined. They call them Congenital Ichthyosis [signifying dry and
scaly], but it looked like a reversion to when we were crustaceous
[shelled invertebrates] on the bottom of the sea.</font></font></p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">I
must write about one more incident at Ft. Defiance. A big burly
Navajo policeman, Betahne Nez, came to me complaining of a pain in
his left breast. He was a man of about 50 years, so I thought he
probably had a mild angina. I treated him for several weeks, with no
improvement. He kept insisting it was a coyote&rsquo;s tooth pressing
toward his heart and that he would have to take time off and visit a
famous medicine man to have it extracted. Well, out of curiosity I
gave him more medicine and told him if he were no better to come back
and I would extract the wolf&rsquo;s fang. Meanwhile I was having
some loose teeth from pyorrhea. I sat up after the family went to bed
one night and extracted one of my teeth with the forceps. I
sterilized it thoroughly and bided my time&hellip; Sure enough, he
came back no better. I had the nurse sterilize a scalpel and artery
clamp, and I scrubbed the area to be incised and applied alcohol and
injected a little Novocaine. Quickly making an incision and plunging
in my tooth, held in the clamp. I twisted it around, withdrew it, and
held it up for the patient to see. He nearly collapsed, but was cured
from that moment.</font></font></p>

news of this feat spread throughout the Reservation, and a distant
Superintendent wrote to me saying he had been told that I had done
what he said the Navajo medicine men couldn&rsquo;t do. The
Superintendent poopoohed the idea, but the Indians insisted that the
doctor at Ft. Defiance could perform such magic. You see, the Navajos
have a superstition or belief that a medicine man can make an
incantation and thereby extract a bean or pebble or in this case a
coyote&rsquo;s fang. The method of the medicine men, I was to learn,
was to suck out the offending article which had been previously
concealed in the mouth.</font></font></p>

my 14 years at Ft. Defiance I saw only one case of diabetes. An old

breast. I begged her to let me remove it, but she said, &ldquo;Do you
think I&rsquo;m going to let a young fellow like you cut this out?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;otherwise it will kill you.&rdquo;
The next I saw of her the breast and chest were one big ulcer and she
lived only a short time. Another time I amputated a cancerous penis
but failed to get the lymphatic glands in the groin, and so lost the
patient. With the instruments I bought from Miss Thackera I was able
to do several tonsillectomies and at least two mastoid operations. I
did a cataract extraction on a 15 year old pupil, traumatic of the
right eye. He got 20/20 vision and I fitted him with glasses, but he
would not wear them as his left eye was perfect. Well, anyway, he was
now safe in case of any failure of the left eye.</font></font></p>

vision. He later developed a capsular cataract and was operated on by
my successor at Ft. Defiance after I left, by needling, again &ndash;
20/20. I remember another cataract operation. This was on a Navajo
from near the Hopi Reservation and it was successful in one eye, but
the other one had gone too long. He would take off his glasses and

training. After cutting the capsule the lens rolled into view and he

very little vision. Now I know how each job could have been

educated Navajo. The physician who attended the birth was certainly
culpable for leaving her in such condition. I made a good job of it.
The last was a call from the physician at Pueblo Bonito asking help
with a thigh operation. I had three old men that I had to catheterize
twice a day at the Episcopal Hospital, but Miss Aires, a former
Secretary of the Board of Colorado Nurses said she could do it, so I
drove the 40 miles only to find the doctor was drunk in Gallup. I
told the lady clerk at the hotel to wake him up and ask him if I
should go ahead. He muttered, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; so I amputated near
the knee. The M. D. later said I should have amputated at the thigh,
but I saw the case a year later and he had a wooden stump on his knee
and got around fine. It was a case of TB ankle. I never saw the
doctor again,-as he left soon after.</font></font></p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">And so Dr. Albert M.
Wigglesworth&rsquo;s memoirs, as completed in his own hand at age 89,
come to an end, but this is not the end of his story. Except for a
brief break in 1923 to attend a PG update in his E.E.N.&amp;T.
specialty at Denver, Doc served as Medical Officer at Albuquerque
from 1918 to 1924 when he was put in charge of the medical services
to all Pueblos in the Rio Grande Basin of NM. Since the latter
entailed constant travel, he had his family move to Washington DC
where they stayed with his wife&rsquo;s parents again. By 1925, Doc
had tired of the constant travel, and although his family had
meanwhile returned to Albuquerque, he jumped at the chance to accept
transfer from the Indian Service to the Veterans Bureau. This, of
course, is another whole story. Here we have a lasting major change
of venue, from West to East, from <i>fr</i><i>o</i><i>ntier d</i><i>o</i><i>ct</i><i>o</i><i>r</i>
to eastern establishment doctor &ndash; but the name of Doc&rsquo;s
game was still <i>service to the truly needy</i>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">As of his 10 Sep
1925 transfer Doc, now largely an E.E.N&amp;T specialist, had
performed:</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="list-western">1,000 trachoma expressions, some with
	grottage by Jameson file;</p>
	<li><p class="list-western">800 grottages, McMullen and Fox
	technique;</p>
	<li><p class="list-western">25 tarsectomies &ndash; Fox technique;</p>
	<li><p class="list-western">20 operations/cataract, senile and
	other;</p>
	<li><p class="list-western">30 pterigium operations;</p>
	<li><p class="list-western">3 mastoid operations and countless
	tonsillectomies;</p>
	<li><p class="list-western">10 eneuleations;</p>
	<li><p class="list-western">4,000 eye examinations and countless
	refractions &ndash; since 1 Jul 1924 alone.</p>
</ul>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Now, note that these
are Doc&rsquo;s E.E.N&amp;T statistics for a little over one year!<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote37anc" href="#sdfootnote37sym"><sup>37</sup></a>
In addition, Doc had authored: <i>Trachoma Among the White </i><i>M</i><i>ountain
Apaches</i> (1903); <i>A Case of an Inverted Uterus In an Apache
</i><i>W</i><i>oman </i>(1903); <i>Trachoma Among Nava</i><i>j</i><i>os</i>
(1905); and <i>Blue Spot Am</i><i>o</i><i>ng Navajos </i>(1905).
There&rsquo;s no mention of when Doc slept or what he did in his
spare time. And, if you&rsquo;ve been with us this far, you know that
Doc was the complete physician, covering &ndash; as the quaint if
less than elegant military phrase has it &ndash; everything &ldquo;from
asshole to appetite.&rdquo; Not a pretty phrase, to be sure,  but so
comprehensive and apt! But, now it was time for a change. After all,
Doc and family had spent the first quarter of the twentieth century
laboring in the wilderness. It was time to move on.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Meanwhile, the world
also was changing and moving on. It was 1925. Coolidge was entering
his second term. Hitler published Mein Kampf (and too few world
leaders gave notice). The Hebrew University was founded in Jerusalem.
Rudolph Friml was hailing <i>The Vagab</i><i>o</i><i>nd King </i>on
the New York stage. Rudolph Valentino died. Chicago style jazz hit
Europe. The #1 song of the year was <i>Show </i><i>M</i><i>e The </i><i>W</i><i>ay
To Go H</i><i>o</i><i>me </i>(and Edna was ready). Ominously, Gustav
Hertz won the Nobel prize for Physics for discovering the laws
governing the impact of an electron upon an atom (one can almost hear
<i>Dragnet&rsquo;s<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote38anc" href="#sdfootnote38sym"><sup>38</sup></a></i>
&ldquo;Dum-De-Dum-Dum&rdquo;). A Bible costing $2,000 in Gutenberg&rsquo;s
day could now be had for $3. The <i>Charlest</i><i>o</i><i>n </i>was
the current dance craze. Crossword puzzles became fashionable. Female
skirts went above the knee. Grantland Rice introduced All-American
football teams. The USA led the world with 261,000 miles of railroads
(to which <i>Chief Wig</i> had contributed his rugged share).
Finally, the Washington <i>Senators</i> lost the World Series to
Pittsburgh. But enough, already! It&rsquo;s time to head East.</p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Doc&rsquo;s transfer
from the Indian Service to the Veterans Bureau in 1925 was beneficial
to both. The Bureau gained a highly trained and experienced E.E.N.&amp;T.
specialist, and Doc secured access to quality education facilities
for his fast maturing sons, then ranging in age from 12 to 20. Doc
also gained what was for him previously unheard of stability of
domicile in a highly civilized cultural environment. Certainly he had
earned a respite at last from the rigors of the frontier. At the same
time, this switch enabled him truly to operate and practice medicine
in superbly equipped surroundings and escape the dreaded burden of
administrative mickey mouse and paper-pushing which attended the only
eastern billets available to him through the Indian Service. The VA
was the largest social welfare and hospital operating agency in the
world. It offered both the mission and the means for Doc to further
his own altruistic medical interests. It was a perfect marriage of
mutual objectives &ndash; directly serving the sick, infirm, and
war-maimed and mutilated.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Dec&rsquo;s first
assignment under the VA would take him to Rutland Heights, MA, on 22
Sep 1925, where he would serve as Head, E.E.N.&amp;T. Clinic of the
local VA hospital for the next 11 years ending in 1936. As a TB
sanatorium originally founded under private auspices in 1920, the
Rutland Hospital passed under VA administrative control in 1921, and
reached its full quota of 250 patients coincidentally with Doc&rsquo;s
arrival in 1925, It would transition from a TB to a general medical
facility soon after Doc&rsquo;s departure. This switch also
occasioned the transfer of eldest son El from the University of New
Mexico, to Jesuit-run Georgetown University in Washington DC (where
he incidentally became a student of his uncle and his younger brother
Frank&rsquo;s namesake, then Professor Herbert Francis Wright<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote42anc" href="#sdfootnote42sym"><sup>42</sup></a>),
and from whence he&rsquo;d eventually graduate. El would board with
Edna&rsquo;s parents.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">So it was that Doc
and El preceded Edna and the younger boys east to Rutland by way of
Washington and New York. Several letters of the period testify that
both Al and El found separation from the rest of the family and their
beloved West a rather wrenching experience. Writing from Washington,
where they first set up El for Georgetown, Doc cites their safe
arrival in DC at 08:40 on 14 Sep 1925. He reported at length on the
beautiful weather, and then closes touchingly: &ldquo;Everything
seems so very lovely except that you&rsquo;re not here. It seems to
me, if such be possible, that I love you more and more each day.&rdquo;
He then signs it, &ldquo;Your loving Al.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">El writes his mother
in a similarly forlorn vein two days later, thus: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not getting over my lonesomeness despite school. I learned that had I
stayed at the University of New Mexico I could have graduated this
coming June. Pop doesn&rsquo;t have to report to Rutland until the
22nd. I hope to get over the blues in a few more days.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Two more brief notes
from Al survive. The first, of 17 Sep 1925, reports how the city had
become locked in humidity leaving him constantly swathed in
perspiration. He determines that his accumulated leave can be carried
over from the Indian Service to the Veterans Bureau, but expresses
doubt that he&rsquo;ll be able to take any, since the billet he is to
fill at Rutland has been vacant for some time and the work has really
built up. Even so, he confesses to being anxious to get there to see
what the work is like, and to find out where they&rsquo;re going to
live. Again in a tender conclusion, he thanks Edna for &ldquo;bringing
up my babies with such loving care to be so healthy and strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">He writes once more,
on the 19th, to report that he&rsquo;ll be leaving for Rutland via
New York the next day. He tells of him and El taking Edna&rsquo;s
parents for a drive in the <i>Reo</i> [a now extinct species of
spiffy early autos] around the <i>Speedway</i>, which only old native
Washingtonians will recognize as Hains Point. He also tells of having
mentioned that he was shy a scapular<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote43anc" href="#sdfootnote43sym"><sup>43</sup></a>
and had since been inundated with a lifetime supply. Finally, he
suggests leaving the car with El to fix up and sell, stating that
while it might be fine for the Albuquerque area, it was too beat up
looking by big eastern city standards. Indeed, life was changing
radically for the Wigglesworth clan in many ways.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">So, we&rsquo;re off
to beautiful rollicking Rutland Heights, MA, a town with a population
slightly in excess of 3,000, and located some 12 miles northwest of
Worcester. &ldquo;Ah yes,&rdquo; you may exclaim, &ldquo;and just
whereinhell is Worcester?&rdquo; A fair question. It is some 25 plus
miles almost due west of Boston. Now, if you don&rsquo;t know where
Boston is, you really should seek help before venturing out alone.
So, there we are! Perhaps it might have been better just to mention
that Rutland Heights is just 5 miles west of Holden, but that would
be a sort of inside joke between youngest son Jack and a namesake
first cousin. In any event, Rutland is a smallish town whose only
claim to fame aside from the veterans&rsquo; TB sanatorium is that
Burgoyne&rsquo;s defeated troops camped their enroute from their
route at Saratoga. No doubt it was a perfect half-way house type of
introduction for the western born younger Wigglesworth brothers to
big city living.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">The period of
1925-1936 was an unsettling one in both American and world history.
It was a time of devastating economic collapse, highlighted by the
Wall Street crash of &lsquo;29, and the incubation phase of the
calamity that would be WWII, presaged by the emergence of Hitler in
Germany. A panorama of the period would recall the Washington
Senators defeating Pittsburgh in the World Series, F. Scott
Fitzgerald giving us <i>The Great Gatsby </i>and Sinclair Lewis
countering with <i>Elmer Gantry</i>. Radio (what&rsquo;s that?) was
becoming popular (with 1.5 million plus in Britain) and the first
scheduled TV was making its debut in some place called Schenectady.
In Washington second-termer Coolidge was making monkeys of the press
(which has apparently never recovered), while a fellow named Scopes
was &ldquo;monkeying around&rdquo; in Tennessee where things really
began to <i>evolve</i>. In Fall River Lizzie Borden was cutting a
wide swath in society, in Paris they were celebrating the arrival of
Lindbergh, while in Hollywood they were introducing so-called
&quot;talkies&quot; &ndash; no boon to mumbling <i>Ramb</i><i>o</i>
Stallone. The stock market plunged through the floor as Herbert
Hoover prattled about prosperity being just around the corner. Then
there was FDR dashing to the rescue as Washington rediscovered the
alphabet (NRA, RFC, and CCC &ndash; not to mention NAACP), and the
country at large rediscovered the pleasures of wine, beer and booze
with the repeal of prohibition. And, so the Wigglesworth clan
regrouped in Rutland Heights, MA, under the aegis of the Veterans
Administration.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">This, therefore,
would seem the proper point to inject a brief history of medical care
as provided to this nation&rsquo;s military veterans. Al&rsquo;s
manuscript now having been fully incorporated herein, all subsequent
insets will signify and credit substantial excerpts from indicated
non-original sources. For the case in point, our source below is the
Fortieth Anniversary publication, <i>The St</i><i>o</i><i>ry of
Rutland Heights </i>issued by the Veterans Administration Hospital
there in 1963. And, away we go&hellip;</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">The
first veterans&rsquo; benefits on record in America were enacted in
1636 on Plymouth Plantation while the Colony was at war with the
Pequot Indians [east or west, there&rsquo;s no getting away from the
fact that &ldquo;we done &lsquo;em wrong&rdquo;]: &ldquo;If any man
shall be sent forth as a soldier and shall return maimed, he shall be
maintained competently by the Colony during his life.&rdquo; By 1776
all the colonies, now a united nation, agreed with this concept of
veterans&rsquo; benefits. [These benefits reached their peak
following WWII.]</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">[For
the Rutland story] we harken back&hellip;to an eventful day in 1921,
when Dr. Bayard T. Crane, founder of private sanatoria in the Rutland
area, decided upon a location of 80 acres long noted for its altitude
[get this!] of 1225 feet and pure air. [Just think, folks, 1225 feet
elevation! This really must have given Al a charge, what with his
background amidst the 14,000 feet Rockies of southwestern Colorado.]
Anyway, such a location was then considered ideal for the cure of the
&ldquo;white plague&rdquo; as TB was then known [and these good folks
clearly having not heard of Al&rsquo;s redskin<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote44anc" href="#sdfootnote44sym"><sup>44</sup></a>
TB patients].</font></font></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Suffice it to say
that the project was turned over to the VA during its construction
period &ndash; becoming USVA Hospital #89, and admitting its first
patient on 14 May 1923 &ndash; and arrived at its full quota of 250
patients in the early summer of 1925, the year Al was to arrive. It
would become a general medical hospital in 1936 before reverting to
its original TB mission (no doubt due to its exceptional height) in
1943. By 1961 it had reverted yet again to a general medical
hospital. Such pendulum patterns seem to be a characteristic of
governmental operations in general. By 1937, shortly after Doc had
departed for the warmer southern climes of North Carolina, the
facility had expanded to 450 patients (almost doubling), and numbered
16 full-time physicians.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">The Rutland <i>St</i><i>o</i><i>ry
</i>details the growth of the hospital and the ever-evolving
techniques for treating TB. However, this would seem a little
extraneous to the story of the head of E.E.N.&amp;T. (even though, as
with Doc&rsquo;s advantage over the NY eye specialists, he probably
knew more about TB than the Rutland TB specialists). Conversely,
there is an utter dearth (never to be confused with a conventional
dearth, for obvious &ndash; we hope &ndash; reasons) of info
concerning the doctor and his clan during this time. We&rsquo;re
talking 1925 to 1936, remember, and the major events in this period
of immediate concern to them were the graduation of all three sons
from college &ndash; El and Frank from Georgetown, and Jack from the
Catholic University of America -&ndash; and the celebration of the
50th anniversary of the Durango-Silverton Railroad &ndash; still
going strong in 1922.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">This seems a good
time to comment on the remarkable adaptability of Al&rsquo;s beloved
Edna. She seems to have made the transition from 100% city girl to
full blown frontier-woman and back again without skipping a beat.
Then there was the time when, after having willingly and successfully
persevered in raising three fine young men under the most primitive
conditions, without neglecting her interest in teaching and church
work, that she got to move to Washington where her folks were and the
living was easy. But, you&rsquo;ll recall, the doctor-instinct in Al
rebelled at being chained to desk work, and so it was back to the
woolly if not still wild West again. There is no recorded murmur on
Edna&rsquo;s part. She went along with it all. And, there was
certainly no diminution of Al and Edna&rsquo;s mutual love as they
careened back and forth across country between virtually two
different worlds. How markedly this stands in stark contrast to the
dissolution of marriages today as a consequence of spouse splitting
over job relocation. A hearty <i>WELL DONE, EDNA!</i> Seems long
overdue.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">So saying, our
gallant couple is off once again, this time on a north-south rather
than and east-west or west-east trek. Al was reassigned from Rutland
Heights, MA, to Oteen, NC, in 1936. Oteen is located in the Great
Smokies and is really a 308 acre azalea-blanketed enclave comprising
37 buildings in suburban Asheville. So, the Wiggs clan was at least
once again amidst beloved bonafide mountains. While the airports
serving Asheville are at an elevation of 2200 feet &ndash; a mere
1000 feet gain over the renowned heights of Rutland &ndash; the
mountains surrounding Asheville rise to between 5,000-7,000 feet.
It&rsquo;s not the Rockies, to be sure, but it is at least
certifiable mountain country &ndash; with plumbing! The family would
&ldquo;base&rdquo; there for the next six years until Al&rsquo;s
retirement from active medical practice in 1942 at age 70. We say
&ldquo;base,&rdquo; since the boys were variously away attending to
college and (as we shall see) affairs pertaining to the opposite sex
(which is no sure thing these days).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">So, we&rsquo;re into
the period of 1942-1946, and we find Tara in <i>Gone With The </i><i>W</i><i>ind</i>
and Joe Louis is being blown away by Max Schmeling. FDR tries to
annex the Supreme Court, and Hitler in fact annexes Austria &ndash;
and Czechoslovakia &ndash; and Poland. Britain retaliates with a
secret weapon &ndash; the BBC inaugurating TV, and the USA retaliates
by introducing Selective Service. Then Hitler suddenly invades Russia
and Stalin stops laughing, and we have the Battle of the Atlantic and
the Atlantic Charter just as suddenly supplanted by the horror in the
Pacific announced by <i>AIR RAID &ndash; PEARL HARBOR &ndash; THIS IS
NO DRILL!</i> Meanwhile, Irving Berlin is content to dream of <i>White
Christmas </i>even as-Fermi splits the atom, the Supreme Court
proclaims Reno <i>splits </i>of husbands and wives to be valid
nation-wide, and celebrities like George M. Cohan and Carole Lombard
split the earthly scene. Was it all really so long ago? Yes. Sorry
about that! 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">In the midst of this
general chaos and near world-wide conflagration, Oteen was just about
the perfect place to be. As an index of its relative safety and
serenity, the only Rose Bowl game not played in Pasadena, CA, was
played in nearby Durham, NC, in 1942, where Oregon State defeated
Duke 20-16. Even the name <i>O</i><i>teen </i>is auspicious, it being
a Cherokee Indian word that simultaneously conveys the notions of
<i>h</i><i>ealth </i>and <i>cheer</i>. A splendid parlay that! Ground
was broken on 25 Mar 1918, and the first patient was admitted in Sep
of that year. By Feb 1942 it was an 850 bed facility with over 800
patients, and a staff of 581 which included 26 physicians. Doc, of
course, would head its E.E.N.&amp;T. Clinic.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Its patients have
included veterans of the Civil and Spanish-American as well as both
World Wars, plus employee compensation cases, and even some members
of the CCC. It had a 9,000 volume library and served some 4,000 meals
a day. It was a &ldquo;big business&rdquo; hospital (for the
Asheville community), but strove valiantly to preserve compassion as
an ingredient in the cure. Some sage has remarked that, &ldquo;The
character of the physician may act more powerfully than the drugs
employed,&rdquo; and certainly in such an atmosphere Doctor
Wigglesworth would more than hold his own. It offered a perfect match
of dedication, medical talent and scientific means.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%"><a name="HFWright"></a>
The years 1941-42 saw a major change in the structure of the
Wigglesworth clan. As mentioned earlier, the boys had largely been
deployed to the Washington area to complete their education and
launch their professional careers. El graduated from Georgetown and
soon was at work as a broker in the Merrill Lynch combine. Frank
graduated from Georgetown and was soon launched on a life-long career
in the service of the United States Coast Guard, both in and out of
uniform. Whereas these two boys had boarded with Edna&rsquo;s parents
while in college, Jack boarded at the home of Edna&rsquo;s brother
Herbert who had meanwhile traded in his tenure at Georgetown to
become Head of the Department of International Law and Political
Science at The Catholic University of America where Jack would
matriculate. One fortunate by-product of this happy eventuality was
that it placed Jack under his Aunt Anne&rsquo;s care when he was
stricken by acute appendicitis. Anne, who had enough medical savvy to
warrant an honorary degree, diagnosed an incipient case of
peritonitis from a highly inflamed and nearly ruptured appendix just
in the nick of time. So, as someone might say (but you won&rsquo;t
read it here), all continued <i>W</i><i>right </i>with the world.
Now, don&rsquo;t go away mad. There&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Following college,
Jack was soon into his life&rsquo;s profession as a personnel
specialist for (&ldquo;Shhhh!&rdquo;) the <i>company</i>. Of course
this only became known many years later when someone noticed his
undercover family car bore the license: <i>CIA &ndash; </i><i>00</i><i>7</i>.
Very subtle chaps, these folks. Anyhow, the young men now having
found their niche in the world &ndash; this still being the era of
1941-42, remember &ndash; they set about getting married and starting
families. (Have you ever noticed how families are never <i>finished</i>?)
On 17 May 41 Jack married Virginia Ryan. While they were both in the
college class of 1935 (Virginia at nearby Trinity while Jack was at
CUA), they didn&rsquo;t meet until five years later when Jack was
Best Man and Virginia was Maid of Honor in her sister&rsquo;s
wedding. Next, El proceeded to the altar on 20 Nov 41 with Virginia
Clark, who was indeed a college days sweetheart. Finally, Frank wed
Emily Farley, daughter of the then Commandant of the Coast Guard, on
10 Jan 1942. Now all of the papooses (or is it papoosae or Papoosi?)
were out of the <i>Wigg-wam</i>, and Doc (apparently) thought it at
last safe to retire &ndash; which he did on 30 Apr 1942, Meanwhile,
his first grandchild had already arrived in the person of Jack and
Virginia&rsquo;s daughter, Ann Virginia, on 9 Feb 1942. Indeed, life
lunges ever forward.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">For Doc, though, who
had meanwhile relocated to an apartment in Arlington, VA, to bring
his family closer together, things were beginning to wind down, even
though he was briefly recalled from retirement by the VA in Mar 43 to
help with the unprecedented VA workload occasioned by WWII. Speaking
of Doc and WWII, we must pause to note the yet enduring plight of the
Indians to whom he gave the best years of his medical life. One case
in point might suffice: the Feb-Mar 1945 battle for an 8 square mile
block of odorous volcanic ash once called Sulfur Island in the far
Pacific but perhaps now better remembered as Iwo Jima. Marine General
Holland &ldquo;Howling&rdquo; Smith said that, &ldquo;Iwo Jima was
the most savage and most costly battle (6855 dead, 21,000 wounded &ndash;
vs. a 1984 population of <i>eight</i>) in the history of the Marine
Corps&rdquo; (which takes in a lot of blood and gore), and it was
about Iwo that no less than Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz testified
that &ldquo;Uncommon valor was a common virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Nevertheless, of
Americans who remember it at all, most recall only the famous <i>second
</i>flag raising (as the photographer thought the original flag too
small) on 546&rsquo; high Mount Suribachi. You may recall that three
battle scarred marines appeared in the picture. One of these heroes
was a Pima Indian from central Arizona. After the war he was to
tragically drink himself to death, because once back home in AZ he
not only couldn&rsquo;t get a decent job, he was a regular Rodney
Dangerfield and &ldquo;Got no respect, at all!&rdquo; (Like, any
popular Almanac will describe the Marine Corps Iwo Jima Memorial in
Washington in terms of the name of the sculptor and the name of the
photographer who shot the original picture, but you&rsquo;ll search
in vain for the name of this poor Pima Indian.) Hell, AZ and NM
didn&rsquo;t give the Indians the vote until 1948!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">But, enough happy
talk about our proud and generous nation. Let&rsquo;s go from the
sadly ridiculous to the beautifully sublime, and chronicle the parade
of Doc&rsquo;s grandchildren as led off by Jack and Virginia&rsquo;s
daughter, Ann. In fast succession followed El and Virginia&rsquo;s
daughter Suzanne (a poignant reminder of the lost little sister) on
28 Apr 1943, followed by Ann&rsquo;s brother and the first grandson,
Michael John, on 4 Aug 1943, followed by El and Virginia&rsquo;s
second entry in the diaper derby &ndash; daughter Elizabeth on 11 Sep
1944, followed by Jack and Virginia&rsquo;s second daughter, Mary
Patricia, on 27 Jul 1945, followed by Frank and Emily getting on the
board with son Haywood Albert on 1 Aug 1945. Hey! There&rsquo;s more
to come, so please bear with &ldquo;the bearing.&rdquo; Next came
what was to be El and Virginia&rsquo;s last entry and only son,
Thomas Clark, on 17 April 1947.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">We interrupt this
remarkable recital at this point to bring you a bulletin from the
<i>Green Light </i>&ndash; A System Newspaper for Employees of the
Rio Grande Railroad. The 15 Jul 1947 edition headlines &ldquo;<i>GLASS
TOP CAR IS SENSATION</i>,&rdquo; It goes on to note that old Tom
Wiggs&rsquo; Silverton branch from Durango is booming as never
before, but let&rsquo;s let the train&rsquo;s paper blow its own
whistle:</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">With
a brass band [four businessmen toting tenor sax, trombone, and bass
and snare drums] booming <i>Hail, Hail, the Gang&rsquo;s All Here
</i>(Kochel listing 1890], and 150 passengers in a festive mood, the
most unique coach in the history of railroading &ndash; the
all-glass-top <i>Silver Vista </i>car &ndash; made its inaugural trip
over the Rio Grande&rsquo;s spectacular Silverton Branch on 22 Jun
1947, When the five-car narrow gauge special returned from the 90
mile round trip, the <i>Silver Vista </i>car had earned top billing
for the greatest thrill ride in modern railroading&hellip;Among the
passengers was Mrs. W. H. Howard of Animas City [Doc&rsquo;s then
only surviving sister, Elizabeth] whose father, Thomas H.
Wigglesworth, came west in 1879 and served as location and
construction engineer for Otto Mears, the noted builder of narrow
gauge lines. She had ridden the first train to pierce &ldquo;the
Animas River Canyon between Durango and Silverton [in 1882]&hellip;At
the throttle was&hellip;a veteran of almost 41 years on the rugged
Silverton Branch and his seasoned fireman&hellip;who hand-stoked
5-1/2 tons of coal during the round trip. It was as smooth a ride
over the twisting, climbing canyon as any train passenger has had
anywhere&hellip;Round trip rail fare for the Durango-Silverton run
through Animas Canyon is $1.80 plus 50 cents for a round trip seat in
the <i>Silver Vista</i>, plus a federal tax of 15 per cent. and
believe us, you get your money&rsquo;s worth &ndash; plus!</font></font></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">The <i>Silverton

elaborates on the festivities attending the advent of the <i>Silver
Vista </i>as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Mrs.

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">The

&ldquo;<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Well
as I remember, only railroad officials were on that first trip,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;My father and mother, my two brothers and I, several
contractors and the crew made up the party. It wasn&rsquo;t a fancy
affair at all.&rdquo;</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Mrs.
Howard, now 79 and living with her daughter, Mrs. Dorethea Stewart of
Animas City, was an excited 14-year-old that day. Her brothers are
John Wigglesworth, Silverton, and Dr. Albert Wigglesworth, Washington
DC. City Manager Jim Wigglesworth is her nephew.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Her
father, Thomas H. Wigglesworth, Rio Grande construction engineer,
came here in 1879 to chart the route of the Silverton. On 1 Apr 1881,
his family joined him, spending the Summer at the camp in Animas
Valley.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Thomas
Wigglesworth, one of the great engineers in Colorado narrow gauge
history, also built the Rio Grande Southern and the Midland Terminal
between Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">The
<i>Silver Vista </i>coach was built in Denver. While its top is
glass, there are no windows at the sides, they being equipped only
with water repellent roll-up curtains for emergency use in case of
heavy slanting rains. It is also equipped with bright blue reversible
seats made with water repellent, fire resistant plastic covering.
According to the manufacturer, &ldquo;It will exceed your highest
expectations.&rdquo;</font></font></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">As mentioned
earlier, by 1986, the cost of the trip had risen to $28.10, and
reservations were required at least a month in advance. Incidentally,
another special car built for the D&amp;RG was the over-height
baggage car, built for the movie <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid</i>, which enabled mounted horsemen to jump out of the baggage
car door during a train robbery scene in the film which was shot at
Florida Mesa some 15 miles east of Durango. Also, for the movie
<i>Ticket to Tomahawk</i>, three cars and an engine were repainted
yellow-gold and the railroad line was re-titled, as was Silverton
which became the town of <i>Epitaph </i>in the film. But enough sop
to movie buffs! It&rsquo;s time to get back to &ldquo;hailing the
gang&rdquo; from the still on-going Wigglesworth baby-boom. After
all, you can&rsquo;t tell the players without a scorecard. (We repeat
only to check your attention.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">At this point both
El and Frank have completed their contribution to multiplying
humanity, and all further additions to the clan emanate from Jack and
Virginia. Paul Wright Wigglesworth made his appearance on 16 Apr
1948, followed by Mary Elaine Ryan on 30 May 1950 &ndash; a signal
marking of the Holy Year. (Meanwhile, uranium was discovered in
Grants, NM, in 1950, and so the miners were off and digging again.)
Next, we must indulge another slight interruption in the birth parade
as the family paused to salute the Golden 50th Wedding Anniversary of
Al and his beloved Edna &ndash; a well-earned milestone if there ever
was one. Then it was back to the nursery, with Judith Ball arriving
on 13 Feb 1952, followed by Albert Matthew II &ndash; who&rsquo;d
naturally come to be known as &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; &ndash; on 2 Aug
1953. Then, suddenly, the party was over for the real Doc, as Edna
passed away at age 77 [a good omen indeed according to biblical
numerology] on 6 Dec 1954.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Yet, life &ndash;
like the march of time &ndash; goes on, and on 1 Sep 1955 Pierre
Giles Wigglesworth was born in the American Hospital at Neuilly Sur
Seine, France. Pierre was in due course followed by the perennial
baby of the family [sorry about that JM] John Matthew, Jr., on 29
March 1957, also at Neuilly Sur Seine. Then, in so far as Doc Wiggs&rsquo;
grandchildren were concerned, he might have said as General MacArthur
did in fact say so long ago on the deck of the battleship Missouri
moored in Tokyo Bay: &ldquo;These proceedings are closed!&rdquo; It
is therefore time to take stock of the stock: a total of 13
grandchildren, born in the 15 year period between Feb 1942 and Mar
1957, and numbering 6 girls and 7 boys. So, cheer up JM, you salvaged
victory by males over females.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Now, just a word
about these last two sprouts on the soil of France. Don&rsquo;t
forget that the Wigglesworth clan evolved from the Norseman of old,
via Rouen and thence the Normans who invaded, conquered and
&ldquo;ennobled&rdquo; Great Britain. That is, these are folks who
were always on the move. Grandfather Tom sustained the nomadic
tradition through migration from New York to Kentucky to Colorado and
other points west. Grandson Frank did his part to maintain the roving
tradition via travel courtesy of the Coast Guard. So Jack was only
doing the family &ldquo;thing&rdquo; as his career took him by turn
from the extremes of Taiwan to Paris. And just in case that wasn&rsquo;t
enough, upon retirement Jack hooked on with a travel agency, and
since has done Europe, South America, and even Australia. Australia?
Everyone knows it&rsquo;s down there, but most folks don&rsquo;t give
a hang. That old Norse wanderlust really dies hard.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">So, via his progeny,
we at last come to the end of Doc&rsquo;s trip-tik. No, he wasn&rsquo;t
through living yet, but his story was coming to a close. Upon
retirement he had gravitated first to Arlington, to be near the
children, and then to an apartment on Connecticut Ave. in Washington,
where Edna could be near her then two surviving sisters, Edith and
Sue. Then, around 1960, he made his penultimate move to a Catholic
senior citizens home in Hyattsville, MD, called Carroll Manor. He
eschewed living with any of his sons, saying, &ldquo;Three
generations in one household is one too many,&rdquo; a typical
reflection of his considerate and generous nature. He was to live in
Carroll Manor until his death two weeks after a stroke in Jun 1964 at
age 92. He brightened the lives of his companions while there, and
frequently stayed briefly with one son or another as the spirit moved
him in response to their importunings. His fine mind lost none of its
gentle humor or keen wit and acuity right up to the end. He was
always the most pleasant of company.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">We can&rsquo;t do
better at this point than sum up Doc&rsquo;s career as found in a
University of Colorado publication briefing the careers of various
graduates by class. Thus, under the class of 1896 we find the
following entry:</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">A.

1936-42.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Following
his graduation from the university medical School, Dr. Wigglesworth
was an intern at Arapaho County Hospital, Denver, for two years. He
was then for two years at Cortez, CO, and then became school
physician at Ft. Lewis Indian School. From 1902-04 he was agency
physician at Whiteriver, AZ, and then held the same position at Ft.
Defiance, AZ, until 1918, He was head of the health section at the
Indian Office in Washington DC in 1918. From 1919-24 he was school
physician at Albuquerque, NM.</font></font></p>

hold the same post at the Oteen, NC, facility.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Well, those are the
cold facts of the curriculum vitae, Surely, you will agree, they
don&rsquo;t begin to tell the story of this warm, inspiring and truly
remarkable man. It has been the main objective of this recital to
make him fully known to you. The Wigglesworth clan can be truly proud
of its heritage. As for the rest of us, we can only be happy to have
met him, however indirectly, in these pages, and may be forgiven if
we remain slightly envious of his progeny.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">The saga of the
Wigglesworth clan didn&rsquo;t end with Doc&rsquo;s passing (or El&rsquo;s
in Nov 1979), and its tapestry continues to be woven by all surviving
members, many of whom are yet impacted and influenced to varying
degrees by the spirit of Doc and Edna. Many more of them there are
who perhaps even unknowingly bear the stamp of their character and
courage, even as they also reflect and pass on the many fine traits
we came to recognize in old Tom Wigglesworth in the course of these
pages. The world is all the better for this, and we&rsquo;re the
better for knowing about these fine folks. There remains, then, only
a compulsion to try and put it all in perspective. More recent news
items may well serve to help us in this endeavor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Excerpts from an
extended entry from the <i>New York Times </i>of 8 Sep 1968 and
datelined Durango, CO, seem relevant, thus:</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">If
it is not a once-famous train that is headed for oblivion these days,
then it is a railroad route&hellip;What may be the latest to join the
ranks is the 200 mile narrow gauge route of the D&amp;RG Western
between Alamosa and Durango in southern Colorado, by way of several
points in New Mexico. A petition to do away with this route is now
before the ICC. The route that the D&amp;RG seeks to abandon would
not affect the carrier&rsquo;s popular 45 mile run between Durango
and Silverton. The latter ride is an objective of just about every
visitor to southwestern Colorado, [Well, of course, both of the
routes mentioned are prime examples of <i>Ch</i><i>i</i><i>ef Wiggs&rsquo;s
</i>engineering skill and perseverance.]</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">As
for the Alamosa-Durango route, it is one of the nation&rsquo;s
highest [it crosses a 10,000 foot pass] and most widely scenic runs;
however, it already has been cut down to irregular freight service
and only occasional passenger excursions&hellip;Approval of the
abandonment petition is expected, for the railroad says [and what a
neat trick that is] that it is losing $500,000 a year on the line.
The petition points out that there is little need for the run, since
good highways criss-cross and are parallel to it. [The article then
goes on to elaborate ways to save the line, as through an organized
fund-raising save-the-railroad movement, and infusion of $150,000
from an on-site movie project starring Robert Mitchum and Arthur
Kennedy.]</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">New
Mexican officials are agitated over the proposed abandonment,
regarding the line as a scenic and historical attraction of special
importance to the state&rsquo;s poverty stricken northern counties
[which, needless to say, are largely comprised of Indian
Reservations]. One suggestion is to make a national monument out of
the route&hellip;(and) operate it for the benefit of tourism, with
railroad buffs donating their services. [Others have noted that]
since the run winds and twists through some of the nation&rsquo;s
highest mountain ranges, and is deeply buried in snow in winter and
swept by torrential rains in summer, the cost of maintenance would be
disparately high.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.15in; line-height: 150%">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">This
lines&rsquo; construction was regarded as a major engineering feat at
the time &ndash; <i>it would still be so regarded today </i>&ndash;
especially the 64 mile stretch between Antonito and Chama. [Don&rsquo;t
you get the feeling that, as we used to say at the movies, &ldquo;This
is where we came in.&rdquo;?] It&rsquo;s said to be the wildest
region ever penetrated by an American RR.</font></font></p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Then, on 13 Jul
1982, the town of Silverton and environs celebrated the 100th
anniversary of the D&amp;RG&rsquo;s Durango-Silverton Railroad &ndash;
<i>The only regulated 100% coal fired steam powered narrow gauge in
the United States</i>. Actually, the celebration lasted the entire
week of 8-13 Jul, and the anniversary was shared by St. Patrick&rsquo;s
Roman Catholic Church and the Grand Imperial Hotel. Well, at least
this shows that some things really last.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">The program included
the exhibition of the movies <i>Denver and Rio Grande</i>, starring
Edmund O&rsquo;Brien and Sterling Hayden, and <i>Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid</i>, starring Robert Redford and Paul Newman. It
also included [would you believe it?] a String Quartet Chamber Music
Concert. The festivities, which embraced many more events (such as
the judging of a beard-growing contest) than mentioned here,
concluded with a Special Train to the dedication of the monument at
Cascade Canyon and an address by Colorado Governor, Richard Lamm. (As
luck would have it, the very week in Jun 1986 in which this section
of our saga was being &ldquo;transcribed&rdquo; in the greater
Washington DC metropolitan area, local TV exhibited two movies
featuring the D&amp;RG: the <i>Butch Cassidy</i> flick, and <i>Ticket
to Tomahawk </i>featuring Dan Dailey. The disappointment of the
former (from the scenic point of view) was more than offset by the
latter, which opened with the credits being rolled over a shot out
the front of the engineer&rsquo;s cab as the train puffed up the
canyon highline along the gorge carved out by the Animas River.
Beautiful!)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">In any event, the
<i>Silverton Standard and the </i><i>M</i><i>iner </i>published a 32
page special anniversary edition marking the triple jubilee, and one
article pointed out that it was the railroad which brought the
Catholic Church to Silverton, arriving via the train from Durango on
22 Jul 1882 in the person of father Michael Brennan. Following the
decline of mining, the church today is a mission of Ouray.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">The ads and
&ldquo;regular&rdquo; features incorporated in the special edition
are almost as interesting as the extensive historical data, much of
which has been included in an earlier chapter of this book. For
example, the weather report for the 4th of July records a high of 76
(&ldquo;that&rsquo;s the spirit&rdquo;) and a low of <i>3</i><i>1</i>'
Most places the latter would be below freezing, folks. One ad invites
everyone to &ldquo;ride the fire-breathing dragon,&rdquo; the same
being the &ldquo;64 majestic miles in the Southern Rockies of
Colorado and New Mexico &ndash; through tunnels, gorges, and over
breath-taking trestles.&rdquo; This would be <span style="font-style: normal">Chief
Wigs&rsquo;</span> crowning achievement of the run connecting
Antonito, CO, and Chama, NM, and which criss-crosses the state border
some two dozen times. Still running then 7 days a week (through 10
Oct), it had apparently been renamed the <i>Cumbres &amp; Toltec
Scenic Railroad</i>. And, since this run was still in operation as of
publication of the 1986 Tour Guide for Colorado- Utah, the good
people of that community seemingly must have prevailed in part over
the abandonment proceedings reported earlier in the excerpt from the
New York Times, Alleluia! There may be hope for the world after all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Other interesting
items include reference to a recent 10k race wherein the contestants
are cryptically reported to have &ldquo;drunk their entry fees.&rdquo;
It must have been for real, however, as the winner averaged six
minute miles, which isn&rsquo;t too shabby. Then, just in case you
were in the market for one, there was an ad by a locomotive
manufacturer, and, in lieu of car rental agencies, they advertised
jeep rentals. &ldquo;Whoa, Nellybelle!<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote47anc" href="#sdfootnote47sym"><sup>47</sup></a>&rdquo;-
And where else might you expect to encounter an International Rhubarb
Festival, with the possible exception of Cooperstown, New York. (To
the uninitiated, that&rsquo;s where the baseball Hall of Fame &ndash;
including umpires &ndash; is located<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote48anc" href="#sdfootnote48sym"><sup>48</sup></a>.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Somewhat sadly,
there is a postscript to this extended description of the 100th
anniversary of the Durango-Silverton of 8-13 Jul 1982, The 26 Aug
1982 edition of the <i>Silverton Standard and the Miner </i>carried a
social item of some relevance to our story, thus:</p>

M. And Virginia Wigglesworth from Chevy Chase, MD, visited in
Silverton Wednesday and Thursday with the Smithsonian group which is
touring railroads and silver mines in the Rockies. The group is
staying at the Grand Imperial Hotel, and rode the train Thursday.
Wigglesworth is the grandson of Thomas H. Wigglesworth, engineer in
charge of the San Juan extension of the D&amp;RG from 1880-82. His
grandmother, Anne Wigglesworth and father, Dr. Albert M. Wigglesworth
were the first passengers on the D&amp;RG railroad. [Coincidentally,
the same issue carried an obituary of Jim Cole, grandson of Billy
Cole &ndash; <i>Old Wig&rsquo;s </i>cook on the Durango-Silverton
job. (See page <span style="background: #c0c0c0">87</span>). The
marriage of Billy and his Irish bride were not a matter of record in
Silverton until Jack confirmed it by quoting Doc&rsquo;s MS at a
Smithsonian group banquet at the Grand Imperial Hotel. As it
happened, reporter Allan Nossaman (see pps. <span style="background: #c0c0c0">54</span>
&amp; <span style="background: #c0c0c0">59</span>) was the main
speaker. Again, on yet another Smithsonian trip, Jack met R.C.
Gorman, now a nationally famous painter in San Francisco, but born in
Chinle and a WWII code-talker. It was established that Gorman had
known Doc, since his first question was, &ldquo;Did your father have
a limp?&rdquo; Join a Smithsonian group and see the world!]</font></font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Now, there is a
reason for all this possibly seeming madness, these extended
quasi-digressions. A picture should be emerging, and that picture is
this: all progeny derives life and inspiration from its roots, and
long-gone ancestors somehow live on, not only through any enduring
physical monuments of their creation, but most especially through
their proud progeny. There is a circuit of love, esteem and mutual
respect between humans from one generation to the next, and we come
to see that we are, indeed, all in this together. Poet John Donne it
right: &ldquo;No man is an island, entire of itself: every man is a
piece of the continent, a part of the main.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve now
passed the midpoint of the 1980&rsquo;s, but the trace of our links
with the 1880&rsquo;s and before have not yet been obscured by the
passage of time. Pride in our independence should long ago have
fallen hostage to our recognized debt to all who have preceded us.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Perhaps St. Paul, no
hero to modern feminists, has somewhere put it best: &ldquo;What have
we that we have not received?&quot;&rdquo; Indeed. And that is why it
is profitable as well as interesting to seek to rediscover our
ancestors, our heritage. It is at once a most humbling exercise, and
yet one wrought with inspiration and encouragement. Also, it reveals
all too well how prone we are to race through life with blinders on,
absorbed in self-centeredness, and thus oblivious to those around us,
including those whose lives, barely overlapping our own, we saw no
need to even attempt to really know. We&rsquo;re the losers. We risk
remaining totally unaware of the source of those inherited virtues
and traits which we in our folly take to be our own handiwork. How
often we pass, like ships in the night with their wireless switched
off, incredibly fascinating and heroic older relatives from whom we
could have learned much of value &ndash; hidden treasures, never
unearthed because we fail to make the effort of establishing contact.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Surely, Doc
Wigglesworth and his ever loyal and faithful Edna stand out in this
regard. Two more quiet, unassuming, self-effacing laborers in the
vineyard can scarcely be imagined. Yet the pattern of their love and
life together brims with rich testimony to uncommon courage,
fortitude, humility and enduring charity, an abiding concern for
others, and general good cheer. Their lives were one continuous
example of service, self-sacrifice and steadfast commitment. There
may have been a day when we could look to recognized saints,
celebrated national heroes, or even the sports pages for such
exemplars of character to emulate. But, not anymore. The world
seemingly quickly consumes or corrupts anyone long in the public eye,
and we are fortunate, indeed, who can turn inward to our families and
find true paragons who practiced what too many others only preached.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Doc was not long at
his final earthly home, Carroll Manor, but he left his mark. He had
been there scarcely two months when the Jan-Feb 1961 issue of the
bi-monthly <i>Carrollette </i>reported on his arrival, noting that,
&ldquo;Dr. Wigglesworth is fine company. He has a genial disposition
and is an excellent conversationalist. He likes good music and good
books, and he can discuss many interesting subjects. He already has
many good friends in Carroll Manor.&rdquo; In the same interview it
was noted that, &ldquo;The Doctor says the happiest years of his life
were the 53 years from the day of his wedding until the year 1954,
when Mrs. Wigglesworth died.&rdquo; Would anyone who has ventured
with us through these pages so far ever doubt it? And Doc was
mentally keen and perceptive to the very end. This is manifest in
another interview for the Feb-Mar 1963 <i>Carrollette</i>, scarcely a
year before Doc was fatally stricken at age 92. A roving resident
inquirer sampled opinion from four compatriots. The question
concerned the danger represented by the reported presence of
substantial Soviet troops in Cuba. Without exception, the other three
interviewees confined their replies to expressions of hope and
encouragement consequent to Kruschev&rsquo;s promise of withdrawal.
Not Doc. The interviewer records that Doc &ldquo;introduced a new
point of view!&rdquo; &ldquo;The greatest menace of all in regard to
Cuba,&rdquo; said Dr. Wigglesworth, &ldquo;is the inculcating of
atheistic communistic doctrines into the minds and hearts of the
children in Cuban Schools&hellip;so that they will form a powerful
menace to both our Church and to our country. The problem is by no
means just a matter of Soviet soldiers on the island. It is far
deeper than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Makes you proud of
the old gent, doesn&rsquo;t it? Do you think you&rsquo;d have come up
with that? Interestingly enough, in the 9 May 1986 issue of the lay
Catholic magazine, <i>Commonweal</i>, we find the bishop of
Matagalpa, Nicaragua, Carlos Santi, &ldquo;a native Italian and
gracious Franciscan (such as baptized Doc in AZ at age 46) who
prefers his brown habit to his purple robes&rdquo; categorically
saying that, &ldquo;One of our great problems is the government&rsquo;s
indoctrination of the young, all that Marxism against Christianity.&rdquo;
Welcome to Doc Wiggs&rsquo; 13-year-old club, bishop! Right on, Doc!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">What the first
interviewer failed to note among Doc&rsquo;s many &ldquo;loves&rdquo;
was his love for <i>pe</i><i>o</i><i>ple</i>, especially including
his family, of course. (As an amusing aside, Doc was no doubt
delighted if he noted that his interviewer transcribed his mention of
early service to the <i>Ute</i> Agency in Navajo Springs, CO, as the
<i>Y</i><i>o</i><i>uth </i>Agency. One wonders if the interviewer
might have sprung from Brooklyn.) One couldn&rsquo;t go far wrong by
hazarding the assertion that <i>people </i>were Doc&rsquo;s life-long
primary concern &ndash; people and their good health and general
welfare &ndash; especially if they were poor or oppressed. Just
consider the dedication of the best years of his life in the service
of the indigent and highly exploited Indian. No one could ever accuse
Doc of seeking the easy life, or striving to become rich. That simply
was not his way. Perhaps &ldquo;his way&rdquo; might best be
recapitulated by excerpting a tribute to him from the 1920 &ldquo;Annual&rdquo;
of <i>The Franciscan Missions of the Southwest</i>, thus:</p>

<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">For
15 years Dr. A. M. Wigglesworth was at the head of the medical work
of the Ft. Defiance Agency and attended all those years also to the
sick of our St. Michael&rsquo;s Indian School, thus becoming one of
our main benefactors. An exceptionally eminent physician and surgeon,
he gained the complete confidence of the Navajos. They recognized his
ability and appreciated him for his successful treatments, his tact
and unvarying friendliness, and, last but not least, because he had
acquired their exceedingly difficult language. Even the medicine men
went to him or sent for him for treatment and medicines instead of
trusting to the efficacy of their own remedies, songs, dances, etc.
Under his supervision a general School and Agency Hospital and a
Tubercular Sanatorium were built at Ft, Defiance, and incalculable
good was done for the amelioration of the health conditions among the
Navajos. In Mar 1918, he was transferred to Washington DC, and placed
at the head of the Medical Department of the Indian Service &ndash; a
well-merited recognition. While at Washington he decided to embrace
the Catholic faith, to which his wife and children belonged. Since
the administrative work in the Capital did not suit his temperament,
he returned to Ft. Defiance the same year, arriving there whilst the
epidemic of influenza was raging. Laboring with his wonted zeal and
ability among the 300 sick at Ft. Defiance, he and his family were
infected with the dread disease, while his family soon recovered, he
suffered a relapse and was hovering between life and death for almost
a week. During this time I [Fr. Anselm Weber, O.F.M.] received him
into the Church. The Good Lord spared him for his family, his many
friends and the Indians. On 29 May 1918, he and his little son
Francis and three children of Mr. J. L. Hubbell [the Trading Post
entrepreneur] of Ganado, AZ&hellip;received their first Holy
Communion at our St. Michael&rsquo;s School. Soon after, because
there were no adequate facilities for the education of his children
at Ft. Defiance, Dr. Wigglesworth accepted transfer to the large
non-Reservation Boarding School at Albuquerque, NM.</font></font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Clearly, Doc was not
only one of the first of what we call today <i>People Persons</i>, he
was a staunch and true friend of the Indians, forsaking a glamorous
main desk job in his wife&rsquo;s own home town after a mere eight
month stint to return to their service &ndash; gladly exchanging a
comfortable life in our Capital City for the primitive conditions of
the Arizona-New Mexico mountain-desert region. If Doc had a love
affair with his Navajo friends, and he did, it was mutual. Our final
exhibit in support of this contention is Doc&rsquo;s obituary as
carried in the Jun-Jul 1964 edition of the St. Michael&rsquo;s
Mission Franciscan fathers&rsquo; publication <i>The Padres&rsquo;

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">So, here we are at
last, at the end of Doc&rsquo;s earthly journey, and as we were at
the very beginning (and as he was for the major portion of his
professional life), focused once more on the plight of our American
Indian neighbors. There is still a question, however, despite Doc&rsquo;s
prodigious lifelong labors on their behalf, of whether we as a nation
have been <i>g</i><i>o</i><i>od </i>neighbors. Remember the problem
posed at the very outset? Navajo Chee (<i>Red</i>) Dodge was in
Washington at the head of a delegation of his braves pleading before
Congress for funds for more schoolrooms and the improved education of
children in his tribe. Congress treated him as though he were there
for laughs, mocking his meager formal education. They were apparently
unaware that this venerable old chief, who was to die at Ganado a
year later (1947) at age 89 was a man of stature in his community.
Born at Ft. Defiance in 1858 of a white Army father (soon killed by
Apaches) and a full-blooded Navajo mother (who died during his
infancy), the resourceful English-fluent Chee was a paid interpreter
($500/year) on the post by age 16. He participated in the <i>L</i><i>ong
</i><i>W</i><i>alk </i>(between Gallup and Ft. Sumner) of 1864-68,
and was accepted as tribal chief from 1884, and served as chairman of
the three-man tribal council from 1923. He even held posts in the
Chester Arthur and TR administrations. At age 88 he was still on
Capitol Hill fighting for the improved education of his people.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">A companion of
Chee&rsquo;s on the <i>Long </i><i>W</i><i>alk </i>was the better
known Navajo war chief Manuelito (this being his Mexican name of
record) who negotiated the earlier referenced treaty of Laguna Negra
(just north of Ft. Defiance) on 18 Jul 1855 &ndash; three years
before Chee was born. The treaty of 1868 went so far as to concede
&ldquo;the necessity for education,&rdquo; and promised a teacher for
every 20 children (ages 6-16) the Navajo could compel to attend
school. (This would be where Aunt Kate Watson, and later &ndash;
happily for our story &ndash; Edna Mae Wigglesworth came into the
picture as teachers. A hundred years later fulfillment of this
function was being supplemented by <i>VI</i><i>S</i><i>TA </i>&ndash;
Volunteers In Service To America.) It should be emphasized that the
initial thrust for the importance of education came from the Navajos
themselves, and that Manuelito was a prime mover in this campaign. In
his old age (he lived from 1820-1894) Manuelito said: &ldquo;My
grandchild, the whites have many things we Navajos need but cannot
get. It is as though the whites are in a grassy valley, with wagons,
plows, and plenty of food, and we Navajos are up on a dry mesa. We
can hear them talking, but we cannot get to them. My grandchild,
<i>school is the </i><i>l</i><i>adder!</i> Tell our people this!&rdquo;
 Well, Manuelito&rsquo;s latter day compatriot kept telling both the
Navajos and the white men, but to little apparent avail in
Washington. Yet, the Navajos never gave up. No doubt a major factor
in their endurance and progress is attributable to their early
recognition of the vital importance of education. Thus, the chairman
of the tribal council in 1963 has remarked, &ldquo;Other Indians have
vanished&hellip;have lost their native languages (which explains why
Navajos remain foremost as wartime communicators among the military
services)&hellip;have lost all or parts of their native hunting
grounds&hellip;have deserted their longhouses or tepees. <i>But not
the Navajos!</i>&rdquo; In large measure, education has been the key
to their survival and proliferation as the predominant Indian tribe
today. It is not without significance that our Edna played a roll in
the education of Navajos.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Along the way you&rsquo;ve
learned how Doc contributed as well, and mightily, to allied efforts
in the sanitation and medical fields, and how he also &ndash; even in
retirement at Carroll Manor was (alone, and long before his adopted
Catholic Church) quick to recognize the <i>educational </i>danger to
our country and Church from the tremendous investment in Cuba (and
now Nicaragua) dedicated to atheistic communistic indoctrination of
children. But, the question remains: what is the situation today with
our own Indians?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Well, at least our
tortoise-paced Church has at last made a move to recognize that the
Indians are part of the human race along with the rest of us. Thus,
the secular <i>Washington Post </i>(but <i>n</i><i>o</i><i>t </i>the
local archdiocesan newspaper) noted on 7 May 1986 that &ldquo;The
Roman Catholic Church, <i>after five centuries in America</i>,
ordained its first native American bishop yesterday.&rdquo; That
would be Donald E. Pelotte a 41 year old Abenaki Indian from the
Algonquin tribe in Maine, who was installed as coadjutor of the
Diocese of Gallup, NM &ndash; a 50,000 member diocese that is 45%
Native American, comprising Navajo, Apache and Pueblo Indians. It was
further reported that the predominantly Indian crowd received
communion to the tune of a Zuni Indian chant. Well, as they used to
say on live TV, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re running a little late, folks,&rdquo;
but at least it&rsquo;s a start. Doc would be pleased.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Now, how about our
enlightened government, so &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; about apartheid in
South Africa, and so zealously behind the &ldquo;freedom fighters&rdquo;
in Nicaragua? Surely, it would be a staunch advocate for aiding our.
own Native Americans, right? <i>W</i><i>rong!</i> Focusing now on the
medical aspect of oft pledged governmental support, on <u>5</u><u>
May 1986</u> the House failed, 263 to 141, to gain the necessary
two-thirds vote to authorize through 1989 the Indian Health Care
Improvement Act for health personnel training and health services.
Now, maybe you can understand that, but somehow, it&rsquo;s doubtful
that Doc would. After all, the measure is merely designed to raise
the health standard of American Indians to a level comparable to that
of the general U.S. population. We&rsquo;re talking about $99 million
over a three year period to <i>save </i>lives, folks, as opposed, say
to $100 million off the top of the barrel in military aid to snuff
out life. If this were a pinball game,  surely a <i>TILT </i>sign
would be flashing. But wait, there&rsquo;s more!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">On <u>1</u><u>3</u><u>
Jun 1986</u> the <i>P</i><i>O</i><i>ST </i>headlined: &ldquo;<i>Navajo
Indians Sue To Stop Relocation By Government</i>.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s
going on here? Well, this might take a little while, but a quick
review of some southwestern history is indicated. More than 1,000
years ago, the Hopi (the peaceful ones, pronounced &ldquo;HOE-pea&rdquo;
&ndash; a really great name for a farming tribe) settled in a
vertically extended (2.5 million acre) rectangle of mesa-dotted
desert farmland centered in northeastern AZ around Walpi, which lies
roughly some 75 miles due west of Ft. Defiance. Of much greater
importance is the fact that, though the Hopi arrived on the scene
some 500 years earlier than the more predatory (Apache-related)
Navajos, the Hopi Land area had by the mid-1800&rsquo;s become a
small island in a Navajo sea (see map of the <a href="#FourCorners|graphic">Four
Corners Area</a>). This inherently precarious situation was further
exacerbated by the fact that whereas the passive and communal Hopi
were cyclically stable planting and harvesting farmers, the nomadic
Navajo (from the introduction of horses and sheep by the Spanish in
the early 17th century) had become increasingly transformed into
pastoral herdsmen whose constant exhaustion of good grazing land
encouraged continual expansion. (It&rsquo;s all too remindful of the
bitter battles between contending fence-building cattlemen and
ever-roaming sheepherders when white culture later entered the
western scene.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">From about the early
1820&rsquo;s Navajo engulfment took the form of outright raids. In
fact, it was precisely such assaults that led to the brutally
enforced <i>Long Wal</i><i>k</i> by the Navajo in 1864 to Ft. Sumner
under Col. Kit Carson. Following this four year incarceration, the
government released the Navajo for a feebly subsidized attempt at
farming which predictably failed. By the 1930&rsquo;s the Navajo land
was so thoroughly overgrazed that the government forcibly reduced
their sheep population and began a policy of encouraging Navajo
farming in earnest, but on bitterly uncooperative land. In effect,
all this did was remove the Navajo&rsquo;s means of livelihood, and
so left the two confronting tribes more hostile than ever. Clearly, a
bigger problem was still in the making.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">All the foregoing is
not to suggest that the government had otherwise generally remained
idle or indifferent throughout this evolving (and still unresolved)
tragedy. In 1868 the government ceded 3.2 million acres (later
extended to 16 million acres) straddling the AZ-NM border to the
Navajo, but it wasn&rsquo;t until 1882 (14 years later) that it
finally ratified some traditional claims of the earlier arriving
Hopi. Besides apparently getting its priorities bollixed, in &ldquo;carving
out&rdquo; 2.4 million acres from the middle of the expanded Navajo
grant for and to the Hopi in 1882, President Chester Arthur&rsquo;s
Executive Order provided that said land was available to &ldquo;such
other Indians&rdquo; as the Secretary of Interior &ldquo;may see fit
to settle thereon.&rdquo; Complicating the situation further was the
fact that the Hopi population (at around 8,000 in 1980) stabilized,
while the Navajo (150,000 by 1980 &ndash; and having meanwhile become
the largest tribe in the USA by 1962) continued to grow. Comes the
government to the rescue again. In 1943 it designated a densely
populated diamond-shaped grazing area of 640,000 acres in the middle
of the so-called Hopi Reservation as exclusively and forever Hopi (so
that since that time Navajo have &ldquo;legally&rdquo; occupied about
75% of the balance of the original Hopi Reservation). Predictably,
the Hopi were outraged at being virtually robbed of 1.8 million acres
of their belated 1882 grant. The Navajo simply argued that they were
obviously the &ldquo;other Indians&rdquo; mentioned in President
Arthur&rsquo;s caveat (which could be equally well used to exclude
them, of course). In 1962 the courts designated the disputed land
(outside the diamond) as a &ldquo;joint-use area,&rdquo; thus leaving
an area approximately 75% as large as the state of Rhode Island
subject to continuing bitter conflict between the Hopi and Navajo.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Naturally the entire
area under dispute then deteriorated rapidly as the two tribes agreed
upon virtually nothing: houses were abandoned in mid-construction,
roads disintegrated, abused wells dried up, hospitals and schools
deteriorated, etc. It should be injected that in a world of
predominantly disintegrating dirt roads, a modern highway is a path
to jobs, education, health facilities and the outside world. Thus, in
1983, youthful representatives from both tribes initiated an attempt
at mutually self-serving reconciliation by proposing a paved 50 mile
highway &ndash; fittingly christened the <i>Turqu</i><i>o</i><i>ise
Trail </i>&ndash; emanating and proceeding due north from Walpi to
the largest Peabody mine, where it would also join the paved
east-west route 160. This estimated $43 million venture was expected
&ldquo;to bring an area frozen in time&hellip;into the present
decade.&rdquo; Proponents even won support of bids for funds and time
from then &ldquo;hard ball&rdquo; Secretary of the Interior James
Watt. However, this hopeful venture was also apparently aborted by
dissension, as the Dec 85 AAA map of AZ still shows only old-time
earthen roads along the proposed route, and subsequent news
dispatches reported that relations between the originally optimistic
instigators as somewhat frayed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">The ill-fated
<i>Turquoise Trail </i>project was also expected to &ldquo;take the
dispute away from the courts, away from the lawyers, away from
Congress.&rdquo; It was noted that ten presidents had tried to solve
the problem, and that it had passed through the hands of 19
secretaries of interior, and that both sides had by 1983 spent
millions of dollars in lawyers fees simply fighting each other. In
recent years Congress has simply been giving each tribe $500,000
annually for legal and associated fees. It&rsquo;s seemingly another
case of the all too familiar governmental approach to problem solving
in general: simply throw enough money at it, and it will disappear.
The government persists in refusing to recognize the deep mystical
attachment Indians have with their land. The Indian regards his
birthplace as the very source of his own being, and a pre-ordained
source of his lifelong sustenance. <i>M</i><i>other Earth </i>is a
deity to be shared and worshiped. So the Navajo strain to hold on to
their primitive dirt <i>h</i><i>o</i><i>gans </i>in the desert, while
the uncomprehending government would lavish upon them $66,000 homes
(plus $5,000 cash) to relocate into the likes of Phoenix, there to
languish (lacking modern day skills) due to being entirely cut off
from their source of livelihood and their admittedly arcane but (to
them) sacred way of life. The Navajo have likened it to &ldquo;selling
your mother,&rdquo; and those who have opted to do so have already
requested psychological counseling at eight times the rate of other
Navajos according to health officials.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Finally, in 1974,
Congress authorized the federal district court in Tucson to partition
the disputed land mainly according to population density. It goes
without saying that once again the Hopi were being unilaterally
disenfranchised by a sort of squatters rights &ndash; not unlike a
familiar plaint from the Palestinians displaced from the West Bank
today. At the same time, from the Navajo point of view this solution
seemed to presage another <i>Long </i><i>W</i><i>alk</i>. This
arrangement is known as Senator Goldwater&rsquo;s <i>Nava</i><i>j</i><i>o-Hopi
Land Settlement Act</i>. It confirmed exclusive Hopi control of
665,000 acres comprising the central &ldquo;diamond&rdquo; area (see
map of the <a href="#FourCorners|graphic">Four Corners Area</a>), and
left the rest of the disputed area to the Navajo. It required Indians
living on the other tribes land (as newly circumscribed) to relocate
to the proper side of the new boundaries by 7 Jul 1986 &ndash;
thereby providing a highly reasonable 12 year grace period for
re-accommodation. Certainly no one can gainsay Senator Goldwater &rsquo;s
familiarity with and dedication to AZ, nor his consummate fairness
and forthrightness throughout a long and distinguished career in
public service. Under the circumstances his solution may well have
been as Solomon-like as humanly possible.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">The &ldquo;Goldwater
Act&rdquo; (projected to cost the government $180 million)
nevertheless generated considerable emotional anguish in that it
forcibly severed members of both tribes from sacred homesteads
(though the validity of this claim by recalcitrant Navajos would seem
to have been somewhat tarnished or rendered more tenuous over the
years by the very fact of their steady voluntary migration which
resulted in the present confrontation.) In any event, the government
&ndash; which, by turn, patiently requested, rewarded and finally
required relocation, has in the period of 1983-86 added something new
to the empty landscape &ndash; a five strand barbed-wire fence
stretching 340 miles across the dusty palomino soil. This was an
unhappy situation for everyone concerned, but you might now think
&ldquo;that would be that.&rdquo; But there&rsquo;s more to the
story. SURPRISE! White culture&rsquo;s energy problems increasingly
came to be seen as a major element in the continuing controversy.
Disagreements became more aggravated as energy companies discovered
huge deposits of coal, oil and uranium offering prospects of
multi-million dollar mineral leases under the &ldquo;shared&rdquo;
land. It has been further contended that the penurious white-owned
mining and drilling companies (Peabody Coal now offers a miserly 15
cents per ton for Hopi/Navajo coal) stir things up even more, hoping
to profit from the dispute. (Presently, mineral leases to white
owners provide one-third of the Hopi annual $2 million budget.) What
we have here, folks, is <i>Commercial-Culture Clash </i>with capital
&ldquo;C&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">The Indians still
believe they issue from the land of their birth, that the land owns
them. They simply cannot grasp the white man&rsquo;s concept of land
law. The very concepts of borders and exclusive territory in &ldquo;a
land that has known no fence&rdquo; is totally alien to their
culture. The Navajo Nation&rsquo;s attorney general has gone so far
as to say, &ldquo;It is their (the Hopi&rsquo;s) land, we recognize
that, under Anglo-Saxon law,&rdquo; but then added, &ldquo;But that
doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s <i>right </i>to destroy a whole
philosophy of life and land because of some white man&rsquo;s concept
of legal title to land.&rdquo; Another observer has remarked, &ldquo;Those
are human beings out there!&rdquo; Not surprisingly, protesting
college youths from Brandeis to Berkeley, aligning themselves with
the American Indian Movement, have become militant sympathizers
favoring the Navajo. The matter has even become a political issue
abroad. The European Parliament has added the tribal dispute to its
official agenda of global human rights concerns. While the struggle
does not fit normal political categories, Republicans, notably
including Senator Goldwater of AZ, generally have backed the Hopi.
Democrats, particularly Senator DeConcini of AZ, generally side with
the Navajo. Tribal chairman reflect like political affiliation: the
Hopi with Republicans, the Navajo with Democrats. While domestic
politics per-see does not yet seem a major factor in the controversy,
it must be remarked that the Navajo muster the most votes and the
best PR.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">As of this writing
(10 Sep 1986) the 7 Jul 86 deadline has come and gone. All of the
Hopi and most of the Navajo have moved, but an estimated 200 to 800
Navajo families still refuse to leave their ancestral homes on Hopi
land. The two young proponents of the <i>Turquoise Trail </i>remain
highly involved in attempts to effect peaceful total compliance with
the re-settlement law. The Hopi representative has pledged not to
remove the remaining obstinate Navajos immediately or forcibly
saying, &ldquo;We know there is hardship for these people,&rdquo; but
he then adds, &ldquo;But this is our land, we&rsquo;ve waited a
century for them to leave it, and we don&rsquo;t see why we should
have to wait any longer.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s hope the long bitter
trial is nearing the end of the trail. Most non-native Americans
(which we might here infer to embrace all except our Indians)
probably couldn&rsquo;t wait to hail the Statue of Liberty
celebrations over 4 Jul 86 saluting the influx of immigrants to our
freedom-loving country, but had Doc Wiggs been alive to witness the
sad recent history and current plight of the descendants of his
dearly beloved native American Navajo &ldquo;clientele&rdquo; of
yesteryear, we may well imagine that this <i>friend of the Nava</i><i>jo</i><i>s
</i>might well have withdrawn to a corner, there to weep in the
shadows. The foregoing should not therefore be viewed as an overlong
digression. Rather, the Indian Connection might better be regarded as
an essential element of the rightfully proud legacy, tradition and
heritage of the Wigglesworth clan. May both the family and its many
friends therefore relish this recital.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">So, you might think
&ndash; this is it! Wrong! The government had yet one more fist up
its sleeve for the Indians. Our final fillip is datelined Washington,
<u>29 Jun 1986</u>: HHS (that&rsquo;s Health and Human Services,
folks) PROPOSES TO CURB INDIAN HEALTH BENEFITS. Well, what can one
say? It&rsquo;s not enough to reject extending hard won (and still
comparably inferior) benefits, now they must be further curtailed!
(Good grief! Where are you, Doc, when we need you?) Under
administration auspices, HHS proposes to curtail Indian health
benefits substantially by the regulatory expedient of simply
re-defining &ldquo;Indian.&rdquo; At present, a person need only
belong to an Indian community or live near a Reservation, there is no
blood requirement. The amended regulation would re-define <i>Indian</i>
as one of at least one-quarter Indian blood. Interior Committee
Chairman Morris E. Udall (AZ) says that about half the tribes already
require one-quarter Indian blood, but that even so the proposal would
slash the number of Indians in California (with by far the greatest
Indian population) by two-thirds.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">The problem is that
the 1.6 million Indians are in far worse health than the rest of the
population, and that the one-third of the Indians living on
Reservations are by far the poorest, and that (as in other sectors of
the population) lower income is directly linked with poorer health.
Authorities point out that the most significant index of Indian
health is that they simply do not live as long as other Americans by
a substantial margin. Even now, for the Indians the
physician-to-population ratio is 0.7 per 1,000 persons &ndash; half
to three-quarters of that of the nation as a whole. Well, it serves
no good purpose further to labor these issues (which continue &ndash;
<i>WATCH YOUR LOCAL PAPERS!</i>), but they do seem highly relevant to
what Doc Wiggs was all about and therefore merit our attention and
understanding.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Nor is even this the
end of it. The Washington Post of <u>19 Jul 8</u><u>6</u> heralds
some further unsavory facts about the continuing great governmental
rip-off of our native Americans, thus: &ldquo;A little noticed
congressional report recites the hardships Indians suffer because of
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) incompetence. The agency acts as the
middleman between the Indians and the oil companies&hellip;Some
Indian families&hellip; (are having) their electricity cut off
because the government is slow in passing along royalty checks from
the companies that pump the oil and gas from the tribal land&hellip;
The BIA keeps the Indians in the dark on the specifics of the oil
company contracts. A survey of Navajos showed that they often don&rsquo;t
receive copies of the leases that allow drilling on their land, nor
are they told how much oil the companies can legally pump. Sometimes,
the Navajos complained, they weren&rsquo;t even notified when and
where the drilling would be done.&rdquo; There you have it. We steal
their mineral riches, cheat an our payments, drive them off their
land, and curtail promised medical benefits. It&rsquo;s almost a case
of how many ways can you skin a cat. So, the Navajos remain at war,
the fight goes on &ndash; only now the enemy is <i>despair</i>: in
the form of a sort of triple scourge that is more easily recognized
under the appearance of abandonment, apathy, and consequent rampant
<i>alcoholis</i><i>m</i>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">So, that is the <i>bad
</i>news, but let us try to end up on a happier note. There are a few
rays of <i>g</i><i>o</i><i>od </i>news. First, there is a <i>NE</i><i>W</i><i>
YORK TI</i><i>M</i><i>ES </i>item datelined <u>18 Aug 86</u> from
Leupp, AZ &ndash; some 20 miles north of Winslow on the Navajo
Reservation. It reports that, beginning with his sabbatical year in
1985 an Israeli agronomist specializing in experimental farms is
(under the auspices of the <i>Ford Foundation </i>and various Jewish
funds) adapting drip irrigation methods developed for the Negev
desert &ldquo;to make the Painted Desert bloom with ripening
vegetables and orchards of fruit.&rdquo; Some 240,000 feet of thin,
perforated, plastic tubing (which gently exude a catalytic mixture of
water and fertilizer near plant roots) is already in place and more
is on the way. Navajos refer to the project as Zhini Baachee &ndash;
<i>black </i><i>i</i><i>ntestines</i>. The first year&rsquo;s effort
tripled crop yield on 12 acres in producing 103 different varieties
of vegetables. The present area of 40 acres is to be expanded to 100
next year, which would serve 50 families. It is estimated that the
process would sustain a typical Navajo family in traditional family
farming style on a plot as small as 5 acres. The plan projects 400
acres for similar cultivation, subject to the availability of funds.
It is an impressive beginning, but after all, the Navajo are spread
over 16 million acres. Meanwhile, the on-going project is already
beset by the dual problems of funding shortages and disputes over the
dissipation of precious water resources. The hope is that the Navajo
will be so impressed that they may on a small but adequate basis
somehow manage to emulate the program over time on their own.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">The final ray of
<i>good </i>news stems from an item in the <i>POST </i>of <u>13 Sep
</u><u>19</u><u>86</u>. A letter from the Assistant Secretary, Indian
Affairs, U.S. Department of Interior, an Indian, responds to earlier
referenced diatribes, notably the entry elaborating the <i>P</i><i>O</i><i>ST
</i>item datelined <u>13 Jun 86</u>. He notes that only 240 Navajo
families remain to be re-located off of Hopi land. He then goes on to
say, &ldquo;There is much good we can do in carrying out this
relocation. We are preparing homes that meet the needs of the people.
We are developing lands that will feed their herds. We are providing
intensive group and individual counseling while involving families in
decisions that affect their future. We are being sensitive rather
than bureaucratic.&rdquo; He then adds this caution: &ldquo;As in
many emotional issues, several outside groups are profiting from the
heartaches of Hopi and Navajo families. These groups, most of them
uninvited and non-Indian, are spending great sums of money to
organize protests that do no more than prolong the distress than to
end it. These so-called support groups would help if they would
reinvest their energies into helping Navajo families in a more
constructive way.&rdquo; <i>Hear! Hear!</i> Somewhere Doc must be
smiling as the government may have rediscovered its heart at long
last.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">There you have it.
In spite of everything, the Navajo tribe has grown and prospered. In
1852 they numbered a mere 7,000 (lagging even the Utes at 12,000)&hellip;By
1890 they had increased to 17,200, and Doc himself serviced some
20,000 by 1904. By 1968 the Navajo numbered 125,000, and the largest
and most populous American Indian Reservation today is the Navajo,
with 160,000 Indians scattered over an area of 25,000 square miles &ndash;
somewhat larger than the entire state of West Virginia &ndash; and
over 3/4 of which is rugged desert country. Just think of that! Doc
Wigqs, as noted earlier, once handled this all by <i>hi</i><i>mself</i>!
No, not quite! Meanwhile, Edna was helping out on the educational
front! In this perspective, it&rsquo;s nice to reflect that perhaps
their tender loving care for over a quarter of a century had
something to do with the Navajo emerging on top. Certainly, Doc&rsquo;s
exemplary life conclusively proves that one single, solitary but
dedicated individual can indeed make a difference. You&rsquo;d have
to say that Old Doc Wiggs packed a tremendous wallop for a 5&rsquo;-6&quot;
tall, 160 pound cripple! Of his life-story, as the saying goes, it
could easily be said: &ldquo;They just don&rsquo;t make movies like
that anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.4in; line-height: 150%">Doc was indifferent
to the creature comforts that most of us crave. The greed infesting
modern society always remained a complete stranger to him. Recall his
starting salary: $1000/year. You don&rsquo;t get rich that way. (Even
Chee Dodge was bringing down $500/year as an unschooled interpreter
at 16. On the other hand, the Governor of the entire New Mexico
Territory was earning only a paltry $1500 per year in 1849, and this
was long before the lucrative banquet-speaking circuit was open to
politicians.) Even as Doc never grasped for wealth; <i>apathy, envy,
malice </i>&ndash; such notions simply weren&rsquo;t even in his
vocabulary. His primary concern was always <i>people </i>&ndash;
healthy, happy people. People were his business &ndash; his life.
Everything he ever did was to ease their plight, and everything he
did &ndash; he did with good cheer AND a <i>smile</i>! The <i>American
</i><i>W</i><i>ay </i>may denigrate titles and such, but nobility is
still alive and well, thank you. Thomas Albert Wigglesworth proved
that! As the Navajo say: Axol&rsquo;a-do: May time go on!</p>
